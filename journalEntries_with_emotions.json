    "entry": "Dear friends and family, Thank you so much for the outpouring of love and support since\nI had my 13 hour 'debulking' surgery for ovarian cancer at Johns Hopkins Medical Center,\nwhere I received extraordinary care, on 8 May; I am so very grateful. Because you are all\nso kind as to write, text and call me, and because I don't always have the stamina to\nwrite individual responses, I am experimenting with this website, which will allow me to\nprovide some collective updates when I can't write individual notes. If you would like to\nbe removed from this list, please let me know. Also please feel free to *not* read any of\nthese updates!\nI am coming along, feeling slightly more energetic, better appetite etc. and am able to\ntake walks in the nice weather. I still have a lot of pain in my core. I will return to Hopkins\nnext Tuesday for evaluations, especially concerning my stomach drainage tubes. I will\nnot be able to begin chemotherapy until the issue with fluid in my stomach, which the\ndoctors detected at the end of my stay, is resolved. Fingers crossed.\nMy mother returned to NY this morning but will meet me in Baltimore next week. And\nBen, who has my car in DC, will drive me back to State College next Thursday. Again, I\ncan't stress how generous and kind everyone has been as I try to direct my 'creativity'\ntowards helping regenerate my body and health. Love, Willa",

The babbling sounds of Spring Creek were very calming,\nthe air was fragrant, the sun warm and we saw some ebony jewelled (?) dragonflies\ndancing with one another! Anyone who knows me well knows that dragonflies are one of\nmy personal emblems. I even had energy after that to go to Meyer Dairy for a delicious\ncoffee malted, most of which I saved. I was pretty exhausted when I returned a lay down\nfor a while before another kind friend brought over some groceries.\nMy surgery was one month ago. My surgeon, Dr. Anna Beavis, compared it to 'being hit\nby a Mack truck and then being rolled over again the other way.' I still have a lot of pain\nin my core. I have a bit more stamina and energy but get very tired by evening. My\nappetite is improved.\nPhoto of me at Spring Creek today.

We also talked about a teaching I find\nmeaningful, from Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (an 18th/19th c. Hasidic rabbi): \"The entire\nworld is a narrow bridge. The most important thing is not to fear.\" There are widely\nvarying degrees of peril or 'fraugthness' in many of our undertakings; the important\nthing is not to look down when you're on that bridge and to stay focused on what needs\nto be done.\nI'll have company at dinner and overnight tonight (more kind friends).

My surgeon said I\u2019m progressing \u2018well,\u2019 but my abdominal CT scan\nrevealed that the drains were no longer well positioned to drain the pocket of fluid that\nneeds to resolve before I can start chemo. So today I\u2019m having a procedure to reposition\nthe drains. And then two more weeks of draining and antibiotics, and then back to\nHopkins in two weeks for another CT scan and drain check. Hopefully they\u2019ll come out\nthen. This puts me \u2018behind\u2019 for the start of chemo, but fortunately the CT scan did not\nreveal any new tumors. Thanks, everyone, for your well wishes.

    "entry": "Back in State College. The drain repositioning went well, and I have returned home with\nonly one stomach drain, which makes a difference psychologically in terms of the time I\nspend flushing and draining the drainage bags. My surgeon also eliminated two of my\ndaily medications plus a daily injection I was giving myself to prevent clotting. So that is\ngood. Of course, many new medications will be added when I start chemo.\nI also met briefly with the liver surgeon who performed part of my operation, Dr. William\nReece Burns, who thought everything looked fine. I can't praise the medical personnel at\nHopkins highly enough; they are superbly skilled, sensitive to patients, thorough,\nresponsive (via email, phone etc.). I feel so fortunate to be treated there. The surgeon\nwho performed my 13 hour operation, Dr. Anna Beavis, must be out slaying dragons in\n                         \nher spare time. She totally rocks.\nI have to return to Hopkins June 25-27, hopefully to have the drains removed. This is\nalways a bit of a logistical challenge as I don't feel comfortable driving that distance due\nto the medications I'm taking, but I will figure out a solution.\nMy mother, who was a super trooper while she was with me in Baltimore, returned to\nNew York by train and Ben (who had my car in DC) picked me up and drove us home,\nwhere he'll stay until he leaves for a business trip on Saturday. Of course I was thrilled to\nhave three hours of car time with my son, and some time here as well. In what must be a\ngood sign, I convinced Ben to let me take him to Alvaro's, the fabulous old-school Italian\nbake shop/restaurant in Harrisburg that is always my midway stopping point when I'm\ndriving to DC. Ben had a delicious chicken parm sandwich on homemade Italian bread.\nMy appetite is much diminished, but I did enjoy about 1/4 of a meatball sandwich, and\nwe shared a homemade gelato (burnt almond/pistachio). With my digestive tract\n'rewired,' I'm nowhere near my normal levels of 'foodiness,' but hopefully I'll get back\nthere at some future point.\nThanks, everyone, for all the texts, messages, emails.

    "entry": "Today I had a consultation with Dr. Hegstrom, the surgeon who will place a port in my\nchest through which I'll receive chemo and fluids. While I'm assured by others that this is\na fairly simple outpatient procedure -- it takes about fifteen minutes and I'll be lightly\nsedated -- the list of potential risks (eg a lung collapsing) is always scary to hear. If all\ngoes as planned, the port will be inserted on 1 July. While Dr. Hegstrom also expressed\nsome concern about my stomach infection not being resolved, which might in turn\nimpact the port placement, in the end he seemed to feel fairly confident (by looking at\nthe fluid in my drainage bag) that my remaining stomach drain would indeed be\nremoved next week. Let's hope so.\nAs the scale revealed that I've lost 10-15 pounds since surgery, and to take the edge off\nthe visit with the surgeon, I treated myself to a small Dairy Queen cone after the\nappointment.\nMy wonderful friend Maria came over for tea and a good chat. Then my equally\nwonderful friend Monique came by with a yummy and nutritious looking dinner of tilapia,\nzucchini and potatoes, which I look forward to trying soon. The visits from friends are so\nuplifting and so essential to my recovery.\nA college friend who had just heard about my health situation from another classmate\nwrote to tell me that she had learned that I was \"very ill.\" This made me wonder if I am,\nin fact, very ill. While ovarian cancer can be notoriously aggressive, I am preferring to\nfocus on the fact that I came out of major surgery very well (aside from the hopefully\nsoon to be resolved stomach drain issue), that I am moving forward to the next stage of\nmy treatment, and that I am receiving superb medical care from doctors fully committed\nto giving me the best possible shot at a good recovery. Also: I'm a trooper.\nMy core has been feeling stronger the past two days.

I've also continued to start getting plugged into various support\ngroups/networks, one an online support group run by cancercare.org, the other a\n'mentorship' program run by Hopkins. Today I was paired with my 'mentor,' a survivor\nwho lives in the Lewistown area, ie not far from State College. I hope to speak with her\nsoon.\nAs mentioned, my core continues to feel a bit stronger but I feel that I must push myself\nharder to take walks, exercise etc. Not always that easy when I'm solo, as I'm not really\nsupposed to walk unaccompanied. Tomorrow, though, I am hoping to spend some time\nwith my friend Maria at the Penn State Arboretum, where we'll surely stroll through the\nbeautiful gardens.\nBut I did push myself to get to services tonight, and I'm glad I did. I was able to get rides\nthere and back. It was nice to be with my Jewish community and to see several people\nwho know about my health challenges and who have been expressing concern in writing\nbut not yet in person.

The congregation is another source of comfort, caring\nand 'uplift,' and some of the prayers are as well. The line that always resonates with me,\nfrom the prayer for a peaceful sabbath night is: \"May you walk with good companions.\" I\n                        \nmost certainly do, and am most grateful for that.",

See\npics below. Having lost about 15 lbs (but yes, what a way to lose weight...) and feeling\nincreasingly stronger post-surgery, I'm probably wanting to preserve this image of me for\nlater visualization, as I'm sure I won't look this way once chemo starts.

W/out going\ninto too much detail, I was frustrated with the radiation oncologist I saw, who made the\ndetermination about the drain, and this put me in a stressed out funk. She had not read\nthe report on my CT scan (which I had this morning) prior to my arrival. She said she\nwould consult w my surgeon, Dr. Beavis, but Dr. Beavis\u2019 nurse had said that Dr. Beavis\nwould defer to radiation oncology on decisions regarding the drain. She (radiation\noncologist) said perhaps I could start chemo even without the drain pulled (as the\nantibiotics I\u2019m taking would offer additional protection) but both Dr. Beavis and Dr. Patel\n(medical oncologist in State College) seemed to me adamantly opposed to this idea. She\nalso mentioned that I might start taking an anti-fungal medication. The first way it might\nbe delivered could pose risks to my heart (!!) so it would probably be delivered via port.\nThe CT scan report mentioned no new tumor growth; that is good. I just hope that the\nbest informed decision can be made regarding next steps. These will obviously include a\nreturn trip here before long - definitely not convenient, but I\u2019ll do whatever is necessary. \nSent from CaringBridge iPhone app",

You've\nhad such an awesome experience with Dr. Beavis, and I believe so far with Dr. Patel. In\nlight of the fact that they're \"adamant\" about delaying chemo until the drain can be\nremoved, it's totally understandable you're perplexed by today's turn-around.

It was good to hear that there was\nno more tumor growth and your stomach abscess has continued to shrink. Continue to\nfocus on the positive! It will win in the end!\n  \u2014Kory Olson, June 27, 2019  \nDear Willa, it's a bumpy road for sure and that must be so hard at times. Thank you for\nwriting and letting us know how you are. It sounds like you have a great home-based\nmedical team in Drs. Beavis and Patel, who seem to know and care about you and will\nhelp you make the best decisions. They will get you through! It can be so unnerving\nwhen the docs don't seem to agree at first -but they are probably just floating options\nand things will settle down soon so that you have a clearer course of action.

Beavis, Mehta (radiation oncologist) and Patel (medical\noncologist here in State College) have now all consulted and that everyone is on the\nsame page. The one stomach drain will stay in for approximately 2+ weeks longer\n(precisely, two weeks after I begin receiving, on Tuesday, an anti-fungal medication\ncalled micafungin through the port that I will have placed on Monday and through which\nI'll also receive chemo). The doctors hope the anti-fungal medication may help diminish\nthe amount of fluid my stomach abscess is producing. In any event, after about two\nweeks they will make a determination about whether I should return to Hopkins for\nanother CT scan or whether chemo could start right away in State College. This will\ndepend in large part on how much drainage there is from my stomach.\nI'm sure all these details are scintillating...\nMy wonderful friend Ruth brought 'lunch for two' from Wegman's to my house and we\nhad a lovely time catching up. She encouraged me to turn my disappointment about\nthings I'm not doing this summer, which winds up draining my energy, into a forward\nhopeful look towards doing them next year.

    "entry": "Aside from driving, I accomplished a few more 'firsts' this weekend (since surgery): I\ndrove to the Saturday farmers market for the first time this summer. Anyone who knows\nme well knows that, as a confirmed foodie, I love shopping at farmers markets (whether\nin State College, Paris, New York or elsewhere) and cooking with whatever is fresh and\nlocal. I also enjoy our farmers market as a social scene - it's always nice to run into\nfriends and neighbors and I was missing that. Fortunately, my dear friend Maria met me\nat the market because it proved a slight challenge. I was fine for about half an hour but\nthen the heat (perhaps 85 degrees?) starting getting to me and I felt rather weak. Maria\nscuttled me under a tent set up with chairs and brought me a very refreshing drink of\nPineapple Shrub from Tait Farm (a great local place) and sparkling water. After a while I\nfelt fine and drove home. And I did manage to nab some great looking red and golden\nbeets from local Amish farmers, some garlic scapes and four freshly baked donuts in\npreparation for Ben's arrival later that morning.\nSpeaking of food, my cooking mojo may be returning. Not sure whether it's a 'one off,'\nwhether I like nothing better than to cook for Ben, or some other reason, but I prepared a\nsalad with the beets tossed with a good vinaigrette and goat cheese and also made\nsome tangy garlic scape pesto, which we slathered on penne. Ben cooked the mahi-\nmahi. I'm still *extremely* grateful for the meals that friends are bringing me, as the\ncooking did tire me out a bit and do not have the energy to do it every day, but I'm very\nglad to feel motivated, for the first time since surgery, to cook some favorite summer\ndishes.\nHaving Ben here for a short overnight visit was the best medicine. We talked, shopped,\ncooked, ate, relaxed, and (re)watched Anthony Bourdain's episode shot in Lyon in\npreparation for Ben and Sammi's upcoming trip there (Ben and I were supposed to go\ntogether, but since I can't do so this summer I'm delighted to send him and his girlfriend\nand to get a full report from them -- with lots of pictures).\nI am anxious about having my port placed tomorrow. I hope the procedure goes well.\nBetween the stomach drain and the port, I expect to feel like a bionic woman by then.\nI had a scare at Hopkins when, while trying to locate the infectious diseases unit, I\nmistakenly stumbled into a waiting room full of cancer patients, many of whom were\nwearing surgical masks, and many of whom looked to me quite ill (very thin, in\nwheelchairs, bald, sickly, coughing etc.). As I feel (and look) relatively 'good' (or at least\nbetter....) right now (and at least compared to right after surgery), I wonder if I have\nlulled myself into a false sense of normalcy and complacency, trotting off to the farmers\nmarket to schmooze with my friends. What's the line that separates me from those\ncancer patients waiting to see their doctors? I have cancer too. The images made me\nshudder and I needed to refocus and get back into the present and the task at hand of\n                        \nrecovery and treatment. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...\nPhotos",

    "entry": "The past few days have been a bit frustrating but I'm focusing on the positive. I am\nhaving an anti-fungal medication, micafungin, delivered via my port to hopefully help\nclear up my stomach abscess (so far, I have not noticed any effect on the amount of\nstomach fluid I've been draining). The goal is for me to be able to administer this\nmedication myself, through my port (through which I'll also receive chemo), but it seems\nquite daunting (many steps, but I think I'll get there). So this morning I am having a third\nvisiting nurse come administer the medication and offer me a third lesson in how to do\nit. Nurse Ruth, who drove here from Akron, Ohio (4 hours), was good humored and very\ncapable, but yesterday Nurse David actually helped teach me better (both were very\nnice and to a certain extent helped alleviate my anxiety, at least temporarily). Nurse\nTodd will, I believe, be arriving soon. The infusion, which drips from a bag hung up on an\nIV pole, takes about an hour and I have to take this med for one month. I can move\naround with the pole and do other things around the house.\nI am also having a hard time arranging transport to/from Baltimore (an unanticipated\nproblem, partly because I did not realize that I'd have to be making so many trips\nthere!), but my wonderful friend Sandy is going to drive me there next Wednesday for\nanother CT scan, consult w/Dr. Mehta (radiation oncologist) and -- again, hopefully (but\nagain, it may not happen) - drain removal.\nI had a great talk last night with Rhonda, an ovarian/uterine cancer survivor who was\ntreated at Hopkins and is my 'mentor' via a Hopkins-based program called Woman to\nWoman. Rhonda was very validating about my feelings, shared her own experiences and\nthose of other survivors, and was also super-encouraging about the current treatments\nand of course the world-class medical care at Hopkins. We are the same age, both have\none son (hers a bit older) and she lives just about 25 miles from here, in Lewistown (her\nhusband and son both work in State College). It feels wonderful to have this 'lifeline' (and\nthe reinforced mantra of \"you are not alone\"), along with a similar great connection with\nDiane in New York (a member of my extended family and also a survivor) and likely soon\na support group in State College that is planning a picnic for August. I am so grateful.\nI have been having a lot dreams about France. Of course, I'd love to be there and miss\nmy 'happy place.' In one dream, I was in the driver's seat of a car that I had stopped in a\ndusty lot, somewhere in the US, with, above me, a maze of highways densely packed\nwith urban  traffic. I was trying to set my GPS to figure out how to drive to France but all\nsorts of odd maps kept popping up. In another dream, I am in France and order a \"Perrier\nmenthe\" (my go to drink for very hot summer days in Paris) but the waiter instead brings\n                        \nme an Ap\u00e9rol spritz, only filled up about halfway, and I am disappointed (I am not a big\nfan of Ap\u00e9rol, as many are, far preferring my spritz with Campari - miam miam). In 'real\nlife,' I've of course been avidly following the women's world cup matches taking place all\nover France. And Ben and Sammi will be heading to Paris tomorrow, and I will be\nenjoying their trip to Paris and Lyon vicariously. I can feel my own travel bug restless\nwithin me and am already dreaming up some new trips - hopefully.\nGrateful to friends John, Sandy and Ron, and Clare for recent visits, delicious food\n(posole, flan, couscous, chilled asparagus soup!) and good cheer.\nWarm thanks to friends who have written emails recently. I *will* write back soon! In\nfact, I am in the midst of answering each of them, but want to give each the attention it\ndeserves, as I do my friendship with you generally as it is important to me. Sorry for the\nlateness, then, but you'll hear from me soon.\nHappy birthday, America.\nHugs,\nemails",

    "entry": "There is not much new to report. I am focused on my upcoming trip to\nHopkins on Wednesday-Thursday and hope that my CT scan will provide\nevidence that my stomach drain can be removed; I guess I have to prepare\nfor the possibility that it won't be, though.This really is a marathon - yeesh.\nCheered that my friend Sandy will kindly accompany/drive me to/from\nBaltimore. We'll both have rooms in the Residence Inn near the Hopkins\nMedical Center (lots of out of town patients stay there, and the staff is very\nnice), which has a lovely rooftop restaurant with panoramic views of the\ncity.\nNurse Todd came over today to change the needle in my port; this needs to\nbe done once a week. He also gave me a refresher in how to administer my\nmicafungin infusion as my previous two solo attempts resulted in either the\nmedicine and/or my blood spurting out of the tubing, which was stressful to\nwitness. Today I managed to do everything correctly, but after the medicine\nhad finished dripping I waited too long to proceed to the next step (flushing\nmy tubing with saline and then an anti-clotting med) as I was enjoying a\nvisit with my friend Maria, and my tubing (which I had forgot to clamp once\nthe medicine finished dripping) again filled with some blood. Oy. I think\ntomorrow will be a charm. Then I'll need to throw two days worth of the med\n                        \n-- which I'm expecting to arrive tomorrow via UPS as part of my next weekly\ndelivery -- on cold packs for transport to Baltimore, along with my i.v. pole,\nso that I can administer the med when I'm there. Nothing in life is simple :(\nTomorrow is the second anniversary of my father's death from lung cancer\nand other ailments and of course I'll be thinking of him (and unless I'm\nunable I'll also observe his yartzheit at synagogue on shabbat a bit later this\nmonth). While it's awful for any parent to witness a child experience a\nserious illness, I think it would have been particularly hard on my father in\nhis extreme ill health. My mother, thankfully, has a tremendous amount of\nfortitude, is very pragmatic, and as a cancer survivor herself understands\nwell certain aspects of my treatment. She's been a great comfort to me.\nAside from a lovely visit with Maria, I enjoyed breakfast out at a local bagel\nplace with my friend Gay. After sitting for a while, my abdomen starts to feel\nuncomfortable, but I was still grateful for the simple pleasure (and frequent\nritual) of having breakfast and catch-up with a close friend.\nMy college classmate and friend Josh sent me some koans familiar to him\nfrom his martial arts practice. Per Wikipedia (!), a koan is \"a story, dialogue,\nquestion, or statement which is used in Zen practice to provoke the 'great doubt' and to\npractice or test a student's progress in Zen.\" There is also sometimes an element of\nparadox in koans.\nFace hard times with an unshakable spirit.\nBe patient with yourself and with others.\nKeep a strong center.\nBe grateful for each moment.\nIf you fall seven times, get up eight times.\nAnother koan Josh sent asks the question of which is stronger, a steel rod or a\nbamboo stalk? Answer: the bamboo stalk, as it is more flexible and can adapt or bend\nas situations require.\nI think I may need, among other elements including continued excellent medical care,\nboth the perseverance of the Zen master and the gutsy badassery of a Megan Rapinoe\n                        \nto meet the challenges ahead.\nBig love,",

    "entry": "Back from the quick overnight trip to Baltimore. Had another CT scan of my abdomen (I\nam almost used to the yucky tasting 'drink' ingested before the procedure, but still could\nnot help spitting up afterwards the contrast dye injected into me, which filled my mouth\nwith a metallic salty taste and my body with a warm and unpleasant rush). Then I met\nwith Dr. Mehta, the radiation oncologist, who said that although the stomach abscess has\nnot completely resolved (it has shrunk by about half and is producing less fluid than\nbefore), she felt that the better plan at this point would be to remove the stomach drain,\nkeep me on two strong antibiotics and an anti-fungal for 4-6 more weeks, and proceed to\nchemo. Of course, the risk still remains that the infection could rear its head during\nchemo, causing the chemo to 'blow up' (as Dr. Patel said), and in turn necessitating a\ntemporary stoppage of chemo and/or reinsertion of stomach drain. I will need to ask\nwhat the chances of this are. I certainly hope it doesn't happen. The risk of waiting for\nthe infection to resolve further would be the possibility of new tumors forming. All my\n                        \ndoctors are on board with the new plan.\nAs mentioned, though, little is straightforward in this journey. When I arrived the next\nmorning to have the stomach drain removed by in the interventional radiologists, the\ndoctors balked, saying that my stomach was still producing too much fluid and that they\ndid not recommend removing the drain. Needless to say, this threw me into a panic, as\nthis was my *third* trip to Hopkins in the hopes of having the drain removed. Only some\neleventh-hour discussions between those doctors and Dr. Mehta resulted in all the\ndoctors getting on the same page about drain removal. But of course this again made\nme feel shaky about the decision to remove the drain, given the initial disagreement\namong the doctors. It is hard for me to sit with this type of anxiety and uncertainty,\nwhen I am really trusting the doctors to make the best decisions. In any event, the\nstomach drain was removed -- to my surprise, I was not sedated and the PA simply\npulled the tube out of my stomach (uncomfortable, a bit painful, but not excruciating...).\nI believe my chemo will start next Thursday, here in State College. Of course, I am\nanxious (a recurrent word in this entry, I see..) and will focus on preparing myself\nphysically and mentally this coming week, while also getting out in the nice weather and\nhaving some fun.\nIn a beautiful act of friendship, my friend Sandy traveled with me to Baltimore and back.\nAs paradoxical as it may seem given the circumstances, we actually had a a great time\non our road trip, and shared many laughs -- whether over the deafening din in the hotel's\nrooftop restaurant, where the horrible acoustics made the rather pathetic musician\nplaying his guitar in a remote corner of the room sound like he was playing a sitar; or\nover our somewhat madcap multi-hour interlude getting repeatedly lost in Harrisburg\ntrying to get to Alvaro's bake shop (closed), Little Amps coffee house (struck out trying to\nfind it at both addresses), and finally winding up at \"The Sandwich Man\" (see pic) in\nPaxtonia, PA, for tuna sandwiches. Felt like Groundhog Day as we kept crisscrossing the\nsame highways and retracing our steps! In another central PA moment, a billboard at the\nedge of Harrisburg raised the question of whether those reading it were going to heaven\nor hell. Maybe I should call the number to find out? In any event, \"cancer is hilarious\" --\noccasionally. A virtual prize to anyone who knows in what t.v. series that line is\npronounced.\nIn another beautiful act of friendship, my dear friend and college roommate Denise Reiss\nand her husband Mike came to visit me briefly at the hotel and accompanied me to my\nprocedure! It was wonderful to see them and Denise has always gone out of her way to\nbe in touch with her friends when they are facing challenges. I wish we could have spent\nmore time visiting but I hope I'll get to see them in NY or PA before long.\nThanks too to my friend John who kindly drove me to his in-laws' farm the other day and\nset up a lawn chair for me right by Slab Cabin Creek that runs through the backyard of\n                        \nthe property.

I'm sorry\nabout all the decisions to be considered and made as they understandably provoke\nintense anxiety. But, it sounds like you are in excellent hands at Hopkins even if it's not\npossible to get unanimity among the doctors. I'm struck by how devoted and selfless\nyour friends and family are.

It would be odd and I would wonder exactly\nwhat mind and heart numbing drugs they had you on. The fact that you find connection\nand humor and fun and measures of peace, in the midst of the journey, is remarkable\nand wonderful and a gift.

    "entry": "With chemo starting on Thursday, I find myself thinking about how my appearance may\nchange, especially with the predicted loss of my hair, possible changes in skin tone, and\nweight gain or loss. Without wanting to seem vain (but I likely am a bit, but hopefully not\negregiously...), I've always prided myself on my appearance, and -- as many know -- am\nall about the clothes, jewelry, makeup and accessories procured near and far that over\nthe years I've worked into a personal style. I love creating and accessorizing outfits that\nsuit my mood for the day, occasion or season. I am anxious that the loss of this part of\nmy identity will depress me. As various friends have pointed out, though, normally this\nwill be a temporary, reversible situation and I'll still get to inject a bit of signature style\ninto my look or experiment with new styles (I'll just need to find the right scarves and\nhats to rock; I saw some cute ones on Etsy, made from kimono fabric). And *of course* I\nrealize that losing my hair is a small price to pay to zap those cancer cells. As my dear\ngrad school friend Vinni and I discussed by phone today, chemo is the crucial next step\nin the healing process, as debilitating as it may be. I am grateful to my mother for\ncoming to State College on Wednesday to see me through the first chemo cycle. She's\nbeen down that road too.\nBut that song from _Rent,_ though, that's been going through my mind recently. It's\nhaunting: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okMdC9-YqrE&list=RDokMdC9-YqrE&start_radio=1&t\n=0\nIt is difficult to know what to say to someone with cancer. For me, what proves helpful\nare encouraging words, positivity re outcome, or simply 'holding space' for whatever\nthoughts or emotions I may be feeling or wish to express. What proves less helpful, again\nfor me, are questions about prognosis, expressions of worry over my being 'very ill,' and\nmention in list form of women who died young of ovarian cancer. I don't intend to sound\nprescriptive, or dictate how people should react to me, and I also have to not be so rigid\nas to deny people their own feelings, but I am learning what my triggers are around my\nhealth situation.\nRandom (and not random!) gestures of kindness are so uplifting and healing -- there\ncontinue to be many of them from all of you (I thank you for even reading my blog, a\nkind gesture, and thank everyone for the texts, emails, cards etc.!). My cherished group\nof grad school friends (\"les filles\") sent me a care package that will enable me to read,\nwatch, listen and doodle my way through the next few months. My college friend Richard\nsent me a short video of him and other friends playing the Fleetwood Mac song\n\"Songbird\" because he knew I liked it. And walks around the arts fest with several friends\nthis weekend were lots of fun. I bought a very pretty 'cigar band' type ring with an opal\nin the middle (see pics - I always wear purple nail polish at least once at the height of\nsummer) and a pretty hamsa, the protective hand that one sees all over the Middle East\n                        \nand that is reputed to bring good luck, happiness, good fortune and health. I always wear\none when I travel and now I will wear this new one through the upcoming weeks. I should\nscarcely be buying stuff for myself right now but well.... I couldn't resist. \nPhotos",
    "comments": "Your hamsa is beautiful. I hope that it holds you in the light dear Willa.\n  \u2014Paula Golombek, July 14, 2019  \nBeautiful jewelry. I found a place online that sells lovely silk scarves specifically for going\nthrough chemo in style. Everyone I met up with in DC supports you with their love.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, July 14, 2019  \nYou should totally be buying yourself stuff right now!!! AND - I think it is great that you\nare figuring out how to keep your style - AND telling all of us what feels good and helpful\n- and what doesn\u2019t. The truth is you are rocking it.\n  \u2014Jane Ginsberg, July 14, 2019  \nI think you know you have friends all around the world thinking of you. Whether it is day\nor night, someone somewhere has you in their mind and their heart. A big hug from\nParis.\n  \u2014Richard Shryock, July 15, 2019  \nI love your insights, dear Willa. It could never be prescriptive to provide clarity on what\nfriends, colleagues, and loved ones should know about \"what to say\" to someone living\nwith cancer. In fact, I think we could all learn a lesson in how important it is to express\nwhat we need and what is helpful along with what is not in all circumstances. Kudos!\nLove the new additions to your jewelry wardrobe and your purple nails. I've always\nadmired your style!\n  \u2014Aileen Galley, July 15, 2019  \nWee-la, I love reading your comments and admire your courage to share. I can't imagine\nwhat you are going through. But how fortunate that you have friends and family who will\ngo out of their way for you. I love the hamsa and purple nails. It's a sign of resilience that\nyou're keeping up your style. The loss of one's hair, invested with so much meaning, is\ndifficult. But, of course it will grow back. In the meantime, you can play around with\ndifferent wigs. My favorite (and yes I'd wear them) are the blue and purple wigs sold in\ncosmetics stores like Ricky's. The purple wig would match your nails and you could post\n                        \nphotos and we could vote on our favorite \"look.\" I love and miss you. I'd love to visit but\nwill have foot surgery on August 1st and my mobility will be limited for 4-6 weeks.

    "date": "July 17, 2019",
    "entry": "My love of both Art nouveau and Japanese art attracted me to dragonflies. In Art\nnouveau, dragonflies often boast a distinctly human and female body, as in Lalique's\nspectacular \"Dragonfly Woman Corsage\" brooch, shown to great success at the 1900\nWorld's Fair. They are symbols of the beauty of the natural world (and of women's\nrelation to it, from the perspective of these creators), but also of transformation and\nrebirth -- the dragonfly emerging from her cocoon. You'll find representations of\ndragonflies all over my house. So as I head to chemo tomorrow and think about both the\npower of my body to regenerate (more white blood cells, hopefully, and fewer cancer\ncells) and the persistence of beauty in the world, I was delighted to receive two\ndragonfly-themed gifts! My father's longtime partner, Jane, who knows all about me and\ndragonflies, sent me a lovely tote bag (pic above) that I'll pack with my iPad (Kindle), ear\nbuds, hand and face creams, snacks and water as I head to my first round of chemo\ntomorrow morning. My friend/colleague, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, brought the right touch of bling with\na beautiful dragonfly pin. Vive les libellules!\nAmong the many descriptions of the experience and effects of chemo that have been\nshared with me, the most striking (lyrical? humorous? affecting? real?) was that provided\nby Richard, my beloved professor, dissertation director and mentor (whom I've known\nsince I was an eighteen-year-old freshman at Harvard in 1977), who has just finished\ncancer treatment himself. Here's what he wrote me: \"Chemo will be like this weird brief love\naffair, with its periodic \u201ctrysts\u201d as you are infused in the hospital.  All the steroids they give you for the\nfirst days will make you feel oddly enhanced, and then you will slope into this weird, mushy place\nafter a day or two, semi-stunned and nauseous. \" I was of course enthused by the initial\ncomparison of receiving chemo to a love affair and trysts, but then it became clear that\nwe may be talking about (in Gaga's terms) a \"bad romance.\" \"Semi-stunned and\nnauseous\" seems far less appealing, along with Richard's warning that \"everything you\neat tastes like shit.\" So I've loaded up the fridge with yogurt and almond milk for\nsmoothies, come what may. One day at a time.\n                        \nI've also been reading some Jewish prayers for beginning chemotherapy (although I\nunderstand that my cells may well have a mind of their own and that the 'power of\nprayer' in my mind is simply akin to a positive and hopeful attitude). This one features\nthe protective imagery, from both the Torah and Kabbalistic mythology, of angels. I also\nlike the thought of compassion for the caregivers, as well as self-compassion:\n\u201cI sit here and I wait, while the medicine drips into my body. I am afraid, and\nI am hopeful. May the medicine that has the power to heal or destroy be\ngentle within me. Give me strength over the next few days, weeks and\nmonths to endure the effects of the drugs and illness. While this disease is\npart of my body, help me to feel powerful and in control of how I live my life.\n\u201cGive me compassion for my doctors, nurses, carers and most of all for my\nown body. May I know that I am encircled by Your love. May the ancient\nspirit of the angels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael bring me a sense of\nYour presence, strength, a light at the end of the tunnel, healing and hope.\u201d\nGoing to lunch with my friends Mar and Jessi at the Corner Room downtown\nthen will head to pick up my mother at the Megabus station. \nBig love,",
    "comments": "Dearest Willa, my heart goes out to you as you start this chemo journey. I have been\nthinking of you every day. We just spent a few days at Nick Newlin\u2018s beautiful farm\nwhere we saw large dragonflies and butterflies all over his gardens. I reminded Mike how\nmuch you love dragonflies.I love the poetic and spiritual takes on the chemo treatment. I\nam also thinking about Sharon at the megabus station. How good to have your loving\nmother there.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, July 17, 2019  \nI've been thinking of you and your mom all day, Willa, and praying for you both as you\n                        \nstep into the as-yet-unknown world of chemo. Richard's vivid imagery will serve as a\ngood initial guide, after which you may have a few choice words of your own to share! In\nany case, stay strong: I know that you will endure and that your experience will open lots\nof new vistas and connections. Much love, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, July 17, 2019  \nHi Willa,\nYou write so beautifully, elegantly. I love reading anything you share about this journey.\nI, too, love dragonflies and they are so symbolic of you, your transformation, and career\ninterests. I love the Torah - infused prayer. Where did you find them? I just came from a\nseries of annoying medical visits - in prep for my foot surgery - and found your prayer\nsoothing. Your body is already in the process of healing itself and there's no reason why\nyou can't have a total refuah schlemah. I like how you're imagining the chemo as healing\nagents. I hadn't sent the Bernie Siegal or Jerry Epstein books because I was concernee -\n2 months ago--that I was being intrusive. But what you wrote above, ie this positive\nembrace of the disease and the power of your healing, with God's help and his dutiful\narchangels - sounds just Jerry and Bernie.\nI know lots of people whose symptoms were similar to those of Richard. I also know\nothers who were never nauseus or lost their taste buds. Let's hope and expect the better\noutcome pour vous, madame ! Call me offline about a healer I know. I love you, Harriet\n  \u2014Harriet Jackson, July 17, 2019  \nDear Willa, Thanks for sharing your thoughts the day before chemo begins! And for the\nprayers! After the invocation of the ancient spirit of the four angels (his archangels,\nHarriet Jackson writes), I'm adding \"and along with the present spirit of her friends,\" that\nyou are brought a sense of His/Her presence, strength, a light at the end of the tunnel,\nhealing and hope. Bien amicalement, Marianne\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, July 17, 2019  \nDear Willa,\nThe dragonfly is a beautiful image to take with you today as you think about your body's\npower to heal and transform itself. May the angels you invoke in this prayer keep watch\nover you and protect you as you start chemo today. You are surrounded with love and\nlight, from the heavens and from your many friends who are holding you in our hearts.\nOne day at a time. I am sending you all my love and prayers.\nShanny\n  \u2014Shanny Peer, July 18, 2019  \n                        \n  \nJuly 17, 2019 - Dragonflies (bis) - photo",

    "entry": "Today, with my first round of chemo completed, my treatment really feels like a full-time\njob. I didn't sleep too well because of the five steroid pills that I took last night to combat\nnausea; they ramped me up. I had a classic work anxiety dream: I was on a dissertation\ncommittee but had not read the full dissertation and was racing around frantically trying\nto finish up some tasks and/or figure out how I was going to deal with my lack of\npreparedness. I could see the numerous other members of the committee assembled\nand looking primed to begin the defense. I won't venture an interpretation here but work\nis never far from my thoughts if sadly less present in my actions right now...\nMy friend Clare drove my mother and me to Dr. Patel's office at 8 a.m. I had blood drawn\nand then met with Dr. Patel for about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, my white blood count\nwas lower than he would have liked, which is somewhat concerning as I need those\nfighting cells! As a result, he decided to proceed but to give me a slightly lower dosage\nof the chemo medications. Calculated risks are often the name of the game in this\nprocess... I was in a room with comfy recliners and other 'amenities' - blankets, pillows,\nsnacks and water, t.v., magazines, a basket of knitted chemo caps for the taking. No\nwindows, though, unfortunately. There might have been about five or six other patients\nreceiving treatment at the same time as me, and three or four nurses were always on\ncall. The nurse who attended to me during the day was extremely kind and experienced.\nFirst, I had to have three 'pre-chemo' meds administered through my port to counteract\nnausea and a possible allergic reaction; this took about an hour and a half. Then, after a\nshort break, I had the chemo meds administered, also via my port: Taxol (three hours)\nand Carbo (.5 hours). I felt fine during all of this. While the Carbo was being\nadministered, the nurse affixed a patch containing Neulasta to my left arm; it will\nactivate after 27 hours (ie at about 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, when I am hoping to be at\nsynagogue to observe my father's yarzeit - we'll see). The Neulasta helps regenerate\nwhite blood cells; the downside is that it can also cause bone pain, so I will take a Claritin\ntonight that supposedly offsets this reaction. Dr. Patel stopped in several times to see\nhow I was doing. Based on the blood work done this morning, he told me that my ovarian\ncancer (CA125) marker was still \"high,\" although of course lower than before my surgery.\nThe hope is that the marker will decrease in number after each treatment. On the other\nhand, the marker for colon cancer was completely normal, which is good news as I had a\nsmall portion of my colon removed during surgery. Dr. Patel suggests that I not get too\nfixated on both the marker number and prognosis at this point, which (as I've seen in\nvarious chat rooms for ovarian cancer patients) can get easily fetishized, becoming the\nobject of either hysteria or jubilation. The 'one day at a time' m.o will be key. By the time\nwe were done it was 4:15. My friend Nan, who now lives in Philly but who spends July in\nBellefonte with her husband, my former colleague, Allan, picked my mother and me up\nand, in my desire for \"instant gratification\" in the form of sugar, drove us to Meyer Dairy,\nwhere I had a delicious small Mocha Chip and caramel sauce sundae, following the\n                        \nmantra of \"life is short; eat dessert first.\"\nAs of now (6:00 p.m.), I feel no ill effects from my treatment, but this may well change in\na day or two. I'm tired, though. I am praying that I don't develop an infection, cold or\nanything else that might interfere with my treatment. I'll return to Dr. Patel's office next\nweek for blood work and then in three weeks for the next round. And I'm supposed to\nreturn to Hopkins soon to see if my stomach abscess has shrunk further, but Dr. Mehta\nand I agreed we'd see how I'm feeling and if I'm up to travelling to Baltimore. As I write, I\nam being 'infused' with micafungin, which I continue to take to resolve the lingering (but\nmuch smaller) stomach abscess. So yes, a full time job for now...\nThere was one serious downer during my chemo session. I was seated next to a very\nvocal Trumpiac, whose ideas were making me as anxious as my treatment, if not more.\nHe was ranting about the sins of the Democrats and pronounced: \"In the worst kind of\nway I want to put a Rebel flag in my truck.\" There were also references to \"brown\npeople,\" contrasted with the 'good' immigrants who came through Ellis Island (including,\napparently, this man's ancestors), and rants about decommemoration efforts (ie removal\nof objectionable statues and state flags in the South). \"It's history,\" he kept proclaiming\nflatly, as if history was immutable and could never be questioned or reinterpreted or\nlearned from. As poison was coursing through my veins, I simply did not have the fight in\nme to take him on (as I've done at a flea market in Belleville where Rebel flags are\nproudly sold). I simply asked the nurse to move me to the other side of the room. Living\nin my nice progressive bubble of State College, I can forget that we're surround by deep\nred rural areas -- prime MAGA country. Definitely stressed me out.\nSo I was on the 'narrow bridge' today. I wrote about this teaching attributed to Rabbi\nNachman of Breslov in another post, citing the translation as \"The whole world is a\nnarrow bridge, but the essence, (really\u2026 the crux of the matter), is not to be afraid.\" I've\nsince read another translation that makes more sense to me. It stresses that what is\nimportant, rather than not being afraid, is not giving in to the fear, not despairing. It\nwould be unnatural to *not* be afraid in difficult situations, especially ones involving\nfacing one's mortality -- as a side note, the absolute *fearlessness* of Alex Honnold,\nwho 'free soloed' 3,000 feet up El Capitan in Yosemite, without ropes, seems positively\nunnatural and there is something downright feral about Alex (see the documentary!).\nHowever, it now seems to me that holding the fear but not becoming paralyzed by it\nwill be key -- a delicate yet necessary balance for the days and weeks ahead.\nA thank you to Michael and Sue for making me my 'last supper' before chemo - per my\nrequest, a delicious grilled Hebrew National hot dog and part of a hamburger, fresh\ntomato and potato salads, watermelon. Yum.\n                        \nThank you, everyone, for your emails and texts today, rides to and from chemo, and for\nsimply keeping me in your thoughts.\nLove,",

    "entry": "On day three post round one of chemo, I'm feeling better than over the weekend, when I\nwas in that \"weird, mushy,\" and \"semi-stunned place\" described by Richard S. and\nneeded to keep clawing my way back into bed to rest/sleep (I attribute the fatigue not\nonly to the chemo drugs but also to an anti-nausea medicine, Compazine). The weekend\npassed in a bit of a haze, although I did manage to drive us to Kohls and Wegmans on\nSunday in the blazing heat, which did not treat me kindly. Today, I woke a bit earlier and\n-- in between brief rest periods -- answered some emails and texts, paid bills, sent a baby\npresent and card, took a walk outside with my mother, drove us to Meyer Dairy for an ice\ncream cone (I've lost twenty pounds so I'm not counting calories too rigidly), chatted\nwith a few visitors, and made headway editing the collective written reflection (now\neighty pages and counting) that my students and I wrote after our Holocaust-focused trip\nto Paris over spring break. Of course, in my 'normal' life I'd be doing ten times more than\nthis -- working on articles and book projects with gusto, going full tilt with professional\nand personal correspondence, taking a long walk, likely cooking something summery\n(pesto, beets, a cobbler, borscht, tomato sauce, stuffed zucchini, caprese salad...), and\nanticipating an enjoyable evening with friends over drinks or dinner. Admittedly, I need a\nfew extra measures of grace to be ok with giving at least some of this up for now,\nbecause I enjoy it so much, as I do with renouncing for the time the kind of\nadventuresome travel I like to do, including with my son. It's summer, and Facebook,\nwhich I should likely avoid, abounds with pictures of smiling friends vacationing in far-\nflung locales that I'd love to visit or revisit  (Greece, Norway, Taiwan, Italy) -- and of\ncourse there is Paris, my 'second home.' I truly do not want to begrudge my friends their\nhappiness - on the contrary. Rather than envy, my feelings shade more into sadness and\n'flatness' (the opposite of a feeling, I suppose, more likely depression). I need to keep the\nlong term goal in mind and commit myself to it every day-- treatment, recovery, ridding\nmy body of disease. The choice is obvious, but no less difficult.\nAs a modest travel goal, when I get better (or better-er) I'd love to spend a long weekend\nor week with Ben in the condo my friend Jim is kindly offering to lend me in Austin. I've\nonly been there twice, and think it would be a great short term destination for a few chill\ndays of music, friends, Tex-Mex, and barbecue, perhaps with a day trip to San Antonio\nand even some research at the Harry Ransom Center. I'm sure we'd like the vibe.\nParis is never far from both my conscious and unconscious. I've been having tons of\nstrange dreams, a few violent, many collapsing and conflating different eras of my life --\nmy childhood growing up in the Gramercy Park apartment (where one dream featured a\ncollege classmate whom I haven't thought about in years), Ben's childhood (another\nconfronted me with about a six-year-old Ben), college (where I was being marginalized at\nsome sort of social function, with many college classmates dressed chicly in black and\nmyself walking sheepishly around the perimeter). The \"France\" dreams were actually\n\"French\" dreams. I had to answer one of three comprehensive exam type questions. I\n                        \nremember two of them: the theme of \"Amazones et \u00e9conomie\" in 18th c. France (on this\nCB site the other day, my friend Jane, flatteringly I felt, compared me to an \"Amazon\")\nand the theme of \"ordre\" (order) in eighteenth-century France (this second theme is\nactually quite interesting and I think I'll store it away mentally to use on a future exam\nfor our students!). Who knew dreams could have such practical benefits!\nSitting here in limbo -- until my blood work on Thursday and my next chemo on 8/8. Will\nmy white blood count have gone up? And did my Neulasta patch activate as it was\nsupposed to, to further boost my while blood count? Will my blood pressure still be low?\nIs my stomach abscess in check? Shrinking? I should find out when I return to Hopkins in\nlate August. When will my hair start falling out? \"Sitting here in limbo/Waiting for the dice\nto roll/Sitting here in limbo/Got some time to search my soul.\" \nAs to my hair, tomorrow I'm getting it cut very short in anticipation of losing it. I can't\npredict how I'll feel. I've never considered my hair my best feature (v. eyes, lips),\nalthough it used to be quite lustrous when I was younger, so perhaps my locks will be\neasier to part with (no pun intended) for now. My stylists certainly 'know the drill' as far\nas clients' hair loss is concerned, so I'm sure they'll be sensitive. And an eyebrow powder\nhas been recommended to me for when those go too. I've gathered a number of scarves\nfrom my collection and will see what works. Should I be a vamp? Une \u00e9l\u00e9gante? A hippie\nchick? I have a vintage Peter Max 'psychedelic' scarf w/zodiac signs to pull that off (and\nyes, I received it as a gift in the early 1970s! - see pic). Maybe I'll just pop on my\nYankees cap and call it a day.",

Your grace, humor, and poignant reflections continue to\nwarm the heart and inspire. xxxxxxoooooo\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, July 25, 2019  \nTry not to compare what you can 'get accomplished' now versus previously. I know its\ntempting. One needs to quiet the voice in ones head that is all about high performance\n(ie getting a good amount of things done and what would be posted on FB or recounted\nat the end of a day.) Rather think more like one might on a beach vacation where ones\n                        \nonly \"must do\" is to relax, rest, slow down, take in what the moment offers, and be as\ncomfortable physically as one can be. That is accomplishment enough. And, yes,\nCompazine is quite the culprit here-- it makes one feel as if one's head is filled with\ncotton candy and one feels at a remove from the present, and fatigued, and unable to\nthink sharply. It is so very dulling. They may be able to suggest other meds for nausea\nthat have less CNS effects than the old standby, Compazine. And, don't rule out some\n'weed', either....though that can also make thinking a focused series of thoughts quite\ndifficult (but, at least, one enjoys the mental 'ride' a bit more, perhaps, than to feel\nspacey).\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, July 27, 2019  \n  \nJuly 23, 2019 - Short but not shorn",

    "entry": "I was apprehensive about the trip to the salon (the unknown, as usual), but all worked\nout well, largely because the wonderful staff at J. Stephens, where I've been getting my\nhair styled for years, was so caring and intent on making me feel good. Instead of going\nfor the full-out bald effect, which seemed radical to me at this point, I opted for a cute,\nsummery transitional bob. It both feels attractive and, because several inches were cut,\nwill likely soften the blow psychologically when my hair does fall out. In comparing a\npicture of me sporting a bob at age three, I wonder if I am simply regressing in my look\nand tastes -- soft comfort foods like pb&j for example are now back at the top of my list\nof mealtime requests. I completed my outing with a visit to Ulta, where I bought some Ka-\nBrow! eyebrow power that will hopefully help create a look that goes Ka-Boom!

    "entry": "Today was a good day, which unexpectedly provoked several mini-laughing jags from me\n(is this an inappropriate reaction? cue exaggerated stage whisper here: \"She has...\ncancer...\"). While in the waiting room at the oncologist, I texted with a friend about\ncringe-worthy/sleazy/weird online dating profiles we've encountered, and she shared\nthat she once read a profile that included the following: \"I admire a woman who can use\nsh-t and f-ck in a sentence\" [Horrified guffaw #1]. Good thing I've forsworn online dating \n\ufffd\ufffd Then, I received an incredibly vividly written email from my friend Randy, describing\nhis valiant yet ultimately failed efforts to muddle through the horrific 108 degree heat in\nParis, where a/c is in scarce supply. It sounded nightmarish, yet his descriptions were so\nfull of grim humor and brimming with insightful contrasts regarding how French and\nAmericans deal with extreme heat that I felt I was reading a _New Yorker_ vignette. To\nwit: \"As I regaled in the last, cool, comforting waffs of air conditioning--an all too precious\ncommodity in this town, as you know--a friend (or rather, a fellow Etoile gazer) began\ncomplaining that the A/C wasn't strong enough. Luckily, I caught myself before snapping,\n\"You just don't know how good you have it, do you?!!\" Instead, I just smiled as I headed\nout\" [Laugh #2]. Then, a friend who stopped by recounted how a friend of hers lost her\nhair from chemo and opted for a Willie Nelson wig (think two long blond 'man-braids'\nrunning down one's back). [Chuckle #3].\nBut there was more reason to take heart, at least for today. My bloodcounts came back\n\"fab,\" according to nurse Kayla, with the white blood counts significantly boosted since\njust before chemo. This means that the Neulasta worked well. Hemoglobin, kidney\nfunction all good. As a 'reward' (but I'll take it), I'll get the full dose of chemo at the next\nround (on 8/8), instead of the lower dose I received this last time because of the lowered\nwhite blood count. There was no new news on the ovarian cancer marker (CA125) post-\nchemo, a marker that Kayla and Dr. Patel both encourage me not to fixate on. I also\nlearned that I will likely have a scan (CT or PET) between rounds three and four, which I\nwasn't anticipating. There again, I was encouraged to focus on the positive (ie \"this\ntreatment generally yields a good result\") rather than all the 'what ifs?' scenarios. I really\nthink I'm getting better at living in the present moment, a self-protective measure to be\nsure.\nAfter two cheering visits from food-bearing friends, my mother and I headed out again,\nto see \"The Hair Lady,\" aka Katherine Fagan\n(https://www.mmhairfashions.com/index.html),\na lovely woman who provides a valued service to women struggling with hair loss for\nvaried reasons (and others who simply wish to purchase hairpieces). I initially thought I'd\nonly consider a human hair wig (if I do purchase a wig, which I likely will), largely based\non my outdated image of synthetic hair wigs as very unnatural looking. I noticed\n                        \nimmediately, though, that the synthetics are very far from wigs of our foremothers'\ngenerations. They are lightweight, comfortable, and look great! With Katherine's help, I\nhad so much fun trying them on and seeing what I'd look like in different hair shades\n(like playing dress up), that I almost forgot the reason I was there. \ufffd\ufffd Again, living in the\nmoment may be key: \"There's only us/There's only this/Forget regret/Or life is yours to\nmiss/No other road/No other way/No day but today.\"\nShould you care to, please let me know which style(s) you prefer (but no obligation!).\nThose pictures feature the colors available in the shop as models; my hair color can be\nmatched to any style -- or I can try a new color. And some bangs can be trimmed a bit,\nand other adjustments made...\n \nPhotos",

Big hugs, can't wait to come see you when I get back\nxoxoxox\n  \u2014Heather McCoy, July 26, 2019  \n#2 is the best. Stay away from #3.\n  \u2014Jim Davis, July 26, 2019  \nWilla, I like all five. I have no idea of the cost, but I think that you should get several --\nand maybe wilder ones. Have you ever wanted to be a red head? or blonde? Now's your\nchance to really experiment. If *I* were voting, I'd go for #1 and #4 as my first choices.\nYou look great in all five!\n  \u2014John Harwood, July 26, 2019  \nReading your posts makes me feel like I'm right there with you. In this case visiting the\nwig lady with you and seeing you try on all these different styles. You look great and I\nagree it's good to be bold and try different styles! (The only one I didn't like as much is #\n3). I like #5 as a professional look and think #4 is a really different fun style for you as\nwell...\nSo good to know the blood counts are so encouraging!\nThank you for keeping us close to you and writing so beautifully and honestly about all\nyou are experiencing and feeling. Sending much love.\n  \u2014Shanny Peer, July 27, 2019  \n                        \n#2 looks most like I recall your hair, but slightly highlighted....so its natural. But, I like\nthe first and the last examples, too. I can't quite tell from the photos, but I'd choose\nbetween the first and last based on which coloring goes better with your skin tones. I like\nthe slight difference though they would make in your coiffe. Leaning towards #1.\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, July 27, 2019  \nI'm voting for 5. Runner-up: 2. I feel 3 is strangely old-fashioned, and 4 is a little too Uma\nThurman, if there is such a thing.!\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, July 27, 2019  \nI like the top 2. You\u2019re quite stunning in platinum.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, July 27, 2019  \nI like #5 because you make an awesome red head :-) It is actually auburn and has a nice\nwarming effect. Of course you are such a stunning woman that none of them look bad\nwith that gorgeous face.\n  \u2014Theresa Coutu, July 27, 2019  \nYou could be a wig model, they all look great on you. I really love the red one. That color\nbrings out the warm tones in your complexion and the overall shape is so flattering. The\nsoft fringe of bangs accents your beautiful eyes, and the simplicity and length along the\nsides accents your cheekbones -- another lovely feature.\n  \u2014Ann Pangborn, July 31, 2019  \n  \nJuly 25, 2019 - Wigs 2",

For a lecture or a learned conference, you might\nchoose one style, but for an ice hockey game, something different. I relied on the knit\nhats in the box you've mentioned, but folks eventually understood, I guess, what I was\nhiding.

    "entry": "100 / 1.901\n                       101 / 1.901\nI still puzzle about whether I should be complying with tacit expectations that I be a\n'cancer victim' - a colleague I have not been in touch with since late April wondered how\nshe might \"brighten my day\" -- when, on weekends such as this for example and perhaps\nsomewhat in proportion to the reality of my health challenges, my heart is brimming with\ngratitude and hopefulness.\nBen is my best medicine. His visits feel healing. Why? Because we talk, laugh, share,\nenjoy activities together, and simply feel the comfort and ease of being around each\nother. He has shown himself to be incredibly compassionate and courageous, when\navoidance or paralysis by anxiety might have been more understandable reactions. He is\nok with meeting me where I am right now. I just hope I can still be the mother he's used\nto having. Alright, Ben, I'll stop embarrassing you now! :)\nEvery time Ben visits, my cooking mojo seems to return, which I equate with creativity\nand energy directed towards one of my favorite activities. For dinner last night, I made a\ntrio of summer salads, drawing on the late July bounty of central PA: an Ethiopian potato\nand beet salad I first sampled at a restaurant in DC (onions and jalapenos, in a lemony\ndressing); a tomato, mozza and basil salad, with a balsamic glaze I made (the Trader\nJoe's brand contains too many preservatives); and an heirloom cherry tomato salad with\nhomemade pesto. Add some crusty baguette, a runny slice of Brie, and voil\u00e0.\nAs mentioned in another post, my Zen space of late is to be found along any of our many\nlocal creeks. Ben and I enjoyed Spring Creek, a prime destination for fly fisherpeople, at\ntwo different points - Spring Creek Park and Fisherman's Paradise. The creek gurgles, the\nsun dapples the water, hummingbirds dance, dense foliage sways, and anglers cast their\nfly lines, forming arabesques. Dangling my feet in the chilly creek was divine. It all felt so\npeaceful, and made me think about a line in one of our prayers at services recently --\nsomething about keeping \"hope in our hearts and eternity in our thoughts.\" To me,\n'eternity' does not connote, for example, heaven or hell - which I don't believe in - but\nrather some sort of immanence or transcendence.\nThe peaceful scene also conjured, somehow, these lines from William Blake:\n\"To see a World in a Grain of Sand/ And a Heaven in a Wild Flower/Hold Infinity in the\npalm of your hand/And Eternity in an hour [...] Man was made for Joy and Woe/And when\nthis we rightly know/Through the world we safely go.\" \n  \nAnd a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour.\n                       102 / 1.901\nPhotos\n                       103 / 1.901\n                       104 / 1.901",

    "entry": "My hair started falling out last night, right before I went to bed. It was certainly\ndisconcerting, an OMG moment, and just felt *wrong* - like I should have been able to\nfigure out how to stick the hair back in or 'fix it' some other way. I lost no time this\nmorning ordering a wig. I settled on the short red one, but may order it in a shade closer\nto my natural color; if I buy a second one, I may well go bolder, but maybe not as bold as\nthe pink 'L'il Kim' wig Samantha sported on _Sex and the City._ And I guess I'll have to\nYouTube scarf folding techniques, as I can't seem to figure out how to to turn them into\nanything I'd feel comfortable having wrapped around my head.\nThanks to my friend Aileen, I have now made contact with a group of about five *local*\novarian cancer survivors (including one currently undergoing treatment). They call\nthemselves the \"III Cs,\" after the stage at which all of them were diagnosed. I was also\ndiagnosed at this stage, apparently a common stage for ovarian cancer, which can be\nlargely asymptomatic (as was my case) and is therefore often diagnosed late. As I\nunderstand it, three of these women are at least twelve-year survivors; I've also come to\nunderstand that in many cases ovarian cancer can be a chronic disease that people live\nwith -- and live *well* with -- for a normal life span. There has been tremendous progress\nin the treatments. In any event, I can't wait to meet these women!\nThe President's incendiary tweets about Baltimore struck a nerve with me, as over the\npast three months I've become very fond of this city. A shout out here as well to my\nEagle cousins, college friend David Miranda and his partner, Peter, and other\nBaltimoreans I know and love. True, the urban blight one encounters driving through\nBaltimore can be shocking, even scary. It always strikes me as a sad cry for help in a\nvibrant city of such historic import, world-class institutions, and great potential. The\ngood, dignified men and women of Baltimore changed my sheets every morning for\nthree weeks in the hospital; greeted me kindly on several stays at the Residence Inn,\nmany of whose customers are patients being treated at Hopkins; Ubered me to and from\nthe medical center, wishing me a blessed day on arrival; poured me lemonade when I\nwas thirsty; and continue to provide me with life-giving medical care of the highest\nquality. So stay strong, Charm City! I'm coming for you in late August, and will be sure to\n                       106 / 1.901\nexpress my gratitude then.",
    "comments": "Lucky you to find a group to share your experiences with! That will make the sailing\nmuch smoother.\nAnd good for you lauding Baltimore as it deserves to be. I still remember the wonderful\ncrab we ate at a restaurant there during a weekend of one of the Eagle's bar mitzvahs.\nWe all had to go the ladies room afterwards to clean our nails.\nKeep on keeping us posted. Your observations and comments are refreshing.\nMuch love,\nAunt Marlene\n  \u2014Marlene Green, July 31, 2019  \nBut they were excellent!\n  \u2014Michael Berkman, July 31, 2019  \nI do remember our trip to the crab house (Obrycki's?) but I don't remember our trip\nto the bathroom to wash our nails! Many great memories too of all our stays at Cross\nKeys for bnei mitzvah and other simchas in Baltimore.\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, August 2, 2019  \nYou were so wise to look into possible wigs last week, Willa, giving you a quick plan A\n(and maybe B) to deal with your hair loss. You will look super chic in red or dark red, as\nwell as in an array of scarves once you get the hang of folding them! Your ode to\nBaltimore is a perfect antidote to the recent presidential idiocies -- honestly, we all need\nto stand up like you and defend the honor of those who live and work there... XXOO, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, July 31, 2019  \nHi again -- so glad you're connecting with others who've been/are in your boat, or at\nleast paddling nearby. I have every confidence that you'll become a scarf-tying wizard,\nbut in the short term, you might consider this website: https://www.tlcdirect.org. They\nsell a whole bunch of pre-tied scarves in surprisingly cheerful and some pretty stylish\nfabrics. It's a shortcut you might want to take. Just a thought. xoxo L\n                       107 / 1.901\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, July 31, 2019  \nThanks so much for letting me know about this great site! I ordered four types of\nchemo-appropriate 'headgear.' I foresee turbans and 'chemo beanies' becoming a\ndangerous addiction... xoxoW\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, August 2, 2019  \nLoved your Ode to Charm City! My granddaughter Tasha Freed just graduated from John\nHopkins and tomorrow begins a career of medical research at Georgetown! What you\nsay about ovarian cancer as a chronic disease allowing for a normal life span is true also\nof many AIDS victims, on which Eric focusses at the NIH. Can't wait to hear about the \"III\nCs.\" Amiti\u00e9s, Marianne\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, July 31, 2019  \nThe Trump disparagement of Baltimore is so painful to read. I lived in Baltimore for 12\nyears, arriving so soon after the start of its downtown renaissance of the late 70s. I lived\nin West Baltimore for several years, in Mr Cummings now insulted district. I studied\nthere. Met my wife and had two kids there. It pains me to see the blight that has\nexpanded especially in East Baltimore around the Hopkins medical campus. I wonder\nwhere are the people who were displaced as their homes were destroyed or abandoned\nor replaced? But Trump is a vengeful vicious man and no city, no Americans of any stripe\ndeserve that animus.\n  \u2014Steven Sherman, July 31, 2019  \nI agree that it is tough to see such rough conditions right around the Hopkins\nMedical Center. Hard to understand, really... I agree too that there is no excuse for\ndissing an entire city the way Trump has. Baltimore has so much heart, so much to offer!\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, August 1, 2019  \nWilla, I'm moved by your words in defense of a city that malice has attacked.\nThe discovery of a group of women who share your experience sounds like a very\nhopeful sign.\nCommunity is important and overlapping communities of friendship and support can only\nhelp!\n  \u2014Christopher Walker, August 1, 2019  \nDearest Willa, I am so heartened to hear about your connecting soon with the \"III Cs.\"\n                       108 / 1.901\nSounds like a terrific chance to engage with inspiring women who can truly uplift each\nother. Thank you also for your great shout-out to Baltimore. (Yes, Trump never ceases to\ndisgust ...) In addition to the superlative Johns Hopkins -- I'm profoundly grateful for the\nwonderful treatment and care they've given my precious cousin! -- the city holds such a\nspecial place in our hearts as my brother's and Ilene's home. For over 20 years,\nBaltimore has been the backdrop of countless simchas for their eight sons and three\ndaughters :)! Nearby, the Cross Keys Inn as well evokes such warm memories of special\nvacation time with my little boys now-turned-young-men, and of getting to know my\nsister's children from New Zealand. (Hayley and I bonded over an joint eyebrow waxing\nthere when she just 14, lol. Just yesterday, when we Skyped with her baby Hazel Tova --\n! -- she sent her love and best wishes to you, honey.)\nI know the hair loss is tough, sweetie. But I suspect the hearty group of \"III C's\" can share\nstories and most likely laughter over that aspect and other tribulations on this journey.\nKeep staying strong and writing your exquisite journal entries! Your grace and resilience\ninspire endlessly. xxxxxxoooooo\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, August 2, 2019  \n  \nAugust 2, 2019 - Beanie time",

For some reason\nthe first image that came to mind was -- sans a specific 'witch' comparison! -- that of the\nWicked Witch of the West's body dissolving into goop (\"I'm melting, melting!\"). For the\nfirst time since I was about twelve, I wrapped a bandanna around my head and tied it at\nthe nape of my neck. I sort of felt/looked like 'cancer girl' but I'm sure I'll get used to it. I\nalso realized that I've become my grandmother when she was younger, babushka and all\n(see photo; my grandmother Bessie is on the left, my great-grandmother Bella is center,\nand my great-aunt Sarah, right).\nThanks to my grade-school friend Lisa, I discovered the website TLC, which offers a\ndizzying trove of options for women in treatment for cancer. I bought four different types\nof 'headgear' - a so-called 'chemo beanie,' pre-tied headscarf, turban, and a cute little\nfloral number for sleeping. The selection was really quite tempting and knowing me I\nrealize that this could become... dangerous. In fact,  I was so jazzed by my foray into\nonline shopping (which I don't do much), that I headed right over to the online sale at my\nfavorite Parisian clothing store, Anne-Elisabeth, snagging the shirt and skirt that I surely\nwould have treated myself to had I been in Paris this summer, as planned.\nI wasted no time today in returning to \"the Hair Lady,\" to finalize details (model, hair\ncolor) of my wig order. I am happy with the purchase and with the compassionate,\nexcellent service from Katherine Fagan. We really hit it off and I'm looking forward to\ngetting together socially with her soon.\nI also look forward to lunch with one of the \"3 Cs\" (local OC survivors) next week; that\nday I'll also join a picnic for another local support group for survivors of cancers primarily\naffecting women.\nBig storm clouds are rumbling outside and soon I have to give myself my daily\nmicafungin infusion (about three more weeks of this, in addition to two antibiotics, which\nhopefully will completely clear up whatever remains of the abscess in my stomach).\nMy brother, on vacation in Israel with his family, was kind enough to have blessed for me\nat the Kotel a red string bracelet, which according to the Zohar wards off the 'evil eye.'\nShabbat shalom/Sabbath peace to all.

Just a normal, pleasant summer weekend,\nalbeit a bit less active one (especially in the evenings) than I'd be used to in my life 'b.c.'\nOn Thursday my friend Gay and I strolled the arboretum, then returned to Gay's house to\nhave lunch on her deck overlooking a lovely lily pond stocked with koi fish. That night I\nwatched a new Netflix film,\"Otherhood,\" about three moms (played by Angela Bassett,\nPatricia Arquette and Felicity Huffman), who, miffed that their twenty-something sons\nhave forgotten to send them Mother's Day cards, decide to show up unannounced at\ntheir apartments in NYC (havoc followed by self-discovery and bonding ensues). There\nwere some chuckles, and a few tears at the end (for example, when a son writes his\nmother a list of things he knows about her -- eg \"You love irises\" -- having failed at this\ntask on demand from his mother a few weeks earlier). It was good fluff for a Friday night\nbut mainly pretty \"meh.\" Saturday morning, my friend Helen and I checked out the\nfarmers market in all its August glory; I was tempted by corn, cherry tomatoes, fennel,\ncantaloupe, and eggplant. We then had lunch at Wegmans Cafe and finished our grocery\nshopping. Today I browsed/shopped at Tait Farm and Pier 1 Imports, where I saw a\ndresser that would look great in my bedroom, if I only I can figure out how to get it\nhome. Funny how, given the question marks around my health, I'm feeling nesting\ninstincts. Have all kinds of ideas for redoing certain rooms and areas of my home that\ncould use some sprucing (although I still love my condo!). Did some walking, reading,\nwriting, finished editing and compiling the blog (86 pages!) that my students and I wrote\nabout our Holocaust-focused trip to Paris in March. And my longtime house cleaner, Liz,\njust dropped off, unexpectedly, a scrumptious looking eggplant parmigiana that her\nhusband, Phil, a talented home cook (esp. of Italian classics), wanted to make for me.\nWhile I continue to be really sad about missing several milestone events in the lives of\nfriends this summer - three out of town or country weddings to be precise, which I\ncouldn't/can't attend due to the timetable my treatment and recovery -- I am so grateful\nfor these simple yet meaningful pleasures and acts of kindness closer to home.\n                       113 / 1.901\nI am returning to my therapist tomorrow after a three-month hiatus. I have spoken to her\ntwice by phone (once when I was in the hospital, once when I was at home recovering\nfrom surgery). I look forward to seeing her, but there's been such a \"paradigm shift\" in\nmy life that we'll need to figure out how to best proceed.\nHave a good week, everyone.  \n  \nAugust 7, 2019 - I Am...Emma Fierce",

    "entry": "114 / 1.901\n                       115 / 1.901\nFirst stop: back to the \"Hair Lady\" aka Katherine Fagan to pick up my wig, which I love.\nI'm not averse to wearing scarves and turbans, but my hair's tied up with my femininity\nsomehow, so it's part of my identity. It's a bit tricky to care for it but I'm sure that before\nlong I'll get the knack of shampooing, conditioning, brushing, and transporting it with\nsome products made for that purpose. The wig's name is \"Emma,\" so perhaps Emma is\nmy new alter ego. I'll go one step further and announce, with a hat tip to \"I am...Sasha\nFierce,\" Beyonc\u00e9's third solo album presenting her own alter ego: I am....Emma Fierce.\nSecond stop: Lunch with some pretty fierce ladies, two of the \"III Cs.\" Helen and Deb are\nOC survivors (over ten years in both cases, although at different places in terms of\nongoing treatment). They were both very open in sharing their stories, generous with\nhelpful practical information (I went right to the supermarket afterwards and procured\nginger tea and oranges), reassuring, and understanding. They get it. Most importantly,\nthey are vibrant, living their lives to the fullest each day. So maybe a corollary to\nGroucho Marx's \"I wouldn't want to be part of any club that I was a member of\" is \"I am\nhappy to be a member of this club, even though it's a club most people wouldn't choose\nto be part of.\" I look forward to seeing these women again, and hopefully to meeting the\nother two \"III Cs.\" Now we are five. A sorority! Ht also to my friend Aileen, who was the\ninitial facilitator of the group, and who connected me to it.\nThird stop: a picnic with another group of resilient, lively women, all breast cancer\nsurvivors, to which my friend, neighbor and fellow JCC congregant Carol invited me, even\nthough I do not have breast cancer. The message I got from all my convos with survivors\ntoday: no day but today. Also: while being on the narrow bridge can be very scary, once\nyou're on it and the precarious situation has been normalized -- as I found today from the\ncompletely matter-of-fact exchanges -- it can really become much less scary. It's often\nmore frightening for those looking on from the outside.\nSecond round of chemo tomorrow. Kind friends are driving me to and from, and I hope to\nhave at least two visitors, to break up the monotony of the long, boring day spent\nhooked up to the drip. I've packed up my dragonfly bag with some snacks, face and hand\ncreams, books, iPad, coloring book (yes!), music etc. And I'll pull on my supersoft pink\nPenn State hoodie, some yoga pants, and one of my cute new caps that arrived today,\nand hunker down for six or seven hours. Hopefully the effects won't be too much worse\nthan last time. \nPhotos\n                       116 / 1.901\n                       117 / 1.901\n                       118 / 1.901",

    "entry": "120 / 1.901\n                       121 / 1.901\nEverything went well with my second round of chemo today. My blood work all came in\nat normal/good levels and I was therefore able to receive all the meds (Benadryl, an anti-\nnausea med, and some other med, then the chemo meds, Carboplatin and Taxol). Total\ndrip time: about five hours. I then had the Neulasta patch affixed to my arm, which will\nboost my white blood cell production, but which can cause bone pain (I will take some\nClaritin to help counteract this reaction). So far so good - I just feel tired as I took\nCompazine, an anti-nausea med that can cause drowsiness. There will certainly be a few\nbad days ahead, but hopefully not much worse than last time, and I did rebound pretty\nquickly.\nI had a minor freak out when Dr. Patel would not tell me my CA125 (ie ovarian cancer\nmarker) number when I inquired. I presume that it's still high (then again I did not\nreceive the full dose of the chemo meds last time), but I think his point is for me not to\nfixate on this number - which is only part of the story - nor on prognosis. He wants me to\nfocus on this needed treatment and to stay strong and positive (which I am doing). I\nhonestly think that, in the end, this is the best strategy for me, as even on my best days\nI tend to be a worrier. He said he'd tell me the marker number after the next treatment.\nHe also helped me better understand how the chemo works, and how sneaky cancer\ncells can fight against the treatment in various crafty ways. This is why chemo does not\nnecessarily provide 'immunity' during the treatment period, although it certainly, and in\nthe majority of cases, can be very effective. Let's hope so.\nBelieve it or not, the ranting Trump supporter who during my last session was warning\nthat he was \"this close\" to putting a Rebel flag in his pickup was back today!! He walked\nin with his wife when I had already been seated for a while (I had preemptively chosen\nthe treatment bay on the side of the room opposite the one where I had been seated last\ntime). When he entered the chemo room and was looking for an empty recliner, he\nloudly announced to no one in particular: \"Last time a lady asked to be moved across the\nroom because of me!\" I waved to him wanly, and said, semi-jokingly: \"Please no political\nrants today,!\" and then wished him good health. His wife then came over to sort of\n'make nice' with me. I took the high road and again wished her husband good health.\nNary a rant to be heard from him, just lots of talk about 'hauling' (this is the operative\nverb in these parts) the Amish in his truck to their various construction jobs and buying\npeaches in bulk at the local produce market. Cancer's an adventure, let me tell ya.\nToday's monotony was broken up by two lovely visitors: first Rhonda, my 'mentor' in the\nWoman to Woman program at Hopkins who happens to live about 25 miles from me in\nLewistown, and who is often in State College. I knew from speaking with her on the\nphone that we had a great rapport, and this was confirmed today (picture attached). She\nis very kind, upbeat, encouraging, and knowledgeable. Her visit really uplifted me. I am\nunderstanding that these kinds of connections will be crucial to my recovery. Then my\n                       122 / 1.901\nfriend Maria came by bearing a coffee milkshake for me from Meyer Dairy. We had fun\nchatting as always, and then she deposited me at home (my kind neighbors Pat and\nDennis drove me to my appointment early this morning).\nOnward.",

    "entry": "I've spent the past two days in a stupor. My reaction to the second round of chemo is\nsimilar to the my reaction to the first. On the day I receive chemo and the following day,\nI feel fine (had sushi lunch with my friend Clare; entertained a doctoral student receiving\nhis degree at commencement this weekend, with his family in tow). But by Saturday the\nMack truck has rolled back into town, flattening me in its wake. I can barely get out of\nbed, and feel weak and achy in my legs, neck etc. Think bad flu symptoms. Minimal\nnausea, though, and I even refrained from taking an anti-nausea med because it makes\nme very groggy. Somehow I managed to get to the farmers market yesterday morning to\npick up some zucchini to make a frittata for dinner -- despite my taste buds being all out\nof whack. Today I was able to sit outside for a while and send some texts and read for\njust a bit. The rest of the time I was horizontal. If things proceed like last time, I hope to\nfeel somewhat better tomorrow, although I'm told that the effects of the chemo can be\ncumulative.  The weather is gorgeous -- slightly cooler, mellow sunshine, with just a whiff\nof 'back to school' in the air (I will not be heading back to school, though, as I'll be on\nmedical leave in the fall). It would have been a perfect day for a hike or long walk, for\ngoing to a greenhouse and puttering around my mini-garden, or hanging out in a park\nwith a friend. Or even doing some work! That makes me feel sad/mad/depressed. But I\n                       124 / 1.901\nneed to simply roll with this... \nMy 'life preserver' this weekend, aside from my own resilience, has come in the form of\nmany caring texts, emails (including from France!), and phone calls from friends, family\nand neighbors. My friend Sandy came over with both some scarves for me to try out as\nwell as some delicious Middle Eastern rice pudding with cardamon, honey, vanilla, and\npistachios that hits the spot in terms of taste and texture. So many people have been so\nkind, and it gives me such motivation to pay it forward...\nHope to have a better report before long. Love, Willa",

The human body urges to heal. The thirteen-hour process\nof 'debulking' my body in May in an effort to rid if of all visible cancer was at the same\ntime turning my body into a lean, mean, cancer-fighting machine. I had multiple organs\nremoved and could barely get out of bed the first weeks in the hospital, but I have\nrelatively little residual abdominal pain now. The pesky abscess in my stomach that\ndelayed my chemo for several weeks was neatly cordoned off, as if willing itself not to\nspread further (I'll find out if it's completely resolved when I go to Hopkins next week).\nAnd if two days ago I was in a stupor, with aches radiating through my legs (still feeling a\nbit 'neuropathic' in my feet...), today I am definitely on the rebound! There will be crappy\ndays, and there will be better days, without doubt. And just because the body\ninstinctively reaches for healing, of course, doesn't mean it will heal, especially in the\nface of disease. But the instinct is there, and that is reason for hope.\nSo I wonder with my favorite American poet, Walt Whitman, writing in 1855 in _Leaves of\nGrass,_ whether the body, rather than corrupting the soul, \"were not the soul\" itself. It\ncertainly seems as pure and divine and miraculous sometimes.\nI don't know why I scheduled a (routine) 7h15 dermatological checkup but I made it\nthere just fine. Everything looks good, and the dr. says there is nothing to suggest that\nI'm at any greater risk for skin cancer than I was before. It was so early (at least for me -\nnot an early riser...) when my appointment ended that I went to a nearby coffee shop for\na cappuccino and a muffin. Then I got to some emails that had accumulated while I was\nwiped out the previous days, and a bit of reading.

To top it off, she gifted me with my choice of a Disney Princess brush --\nquite a hoot, but it turns out these are the brushes with the best bristles for brushing my\nwig! I chose Snow White (I don't even know who Princess Jasmine is...). Like Snow White,\nmaybe I'll wake up from a long slumber and realize this was all just a (bad) dream.\nMaybe there'll even be a Prince Charming awaiting. And some dwarfs. Who knew a brush\ncould be so beneficial?\nToday I received a lovely gift box full of goodies my brother and his family picked out for\nme during their recent trip to Israel and Jordan. Most significant to me is the scarlet\nstring bracelet that my family had blessed at the Kotel in Jerusalem. Kabbalistic beliefs\nand Jewish folk customs hold that a scarlet string knotted seven times and worn on the\nleft wrist (ie the receiving side of the spiritual body) can ward off misfortune caused by\nthe evil eye. Red string bracelets exist in other folk cultures too. So now the bracelet is\ntied firmly on my wrist, next to a thin chain with a hamsa. In Hebrew, hamsa means 'five'\nand images of open hands containing a turquoise or aqua-colored eye are prevalent\nthroughout the Middle East -- again as a protection against the evil eye. So between\nthese two bracelets and a hamsa pendant (plus several other hamsas and similar\namulets scattered throughout my home), I think I am pretty well 'covered.' Somehow the\nimage of the Crusaders, who literally covered themselves and their horses and weapons\nwith crosses (croix, cruces etc.) as protection came to mind. Am I a religious zealot?\nHeck, no. But I'll gladly be a zealot against cancer!\nI registered for, and am seriously thinking of attending, a conference organized by\nHopkins on Sept. 14 (at a hotel in the Inner Harbor) on \"Gynecological Cancer\nSurvivorship.\" It draws together medical professionals (including all those on my care\nteam), survivors, care givers and others. There will be talks about the latest research\nand treatments, Ted talks, a panel featuring five survivors, and breakout panels on some\ncool topics. The three I signed up for are on \"Spirituality and Cancer,\" \"Nutrition and Diet\nafter Cancer,\" and \"Writing through Cancer\" (!!). As always, I'll need to figure out\nlogistics and whether or not I might have a friend or relative attend with me (which\nwould be nice), but I'm hoping I can make it work. \nPhotos\n                       129 / 1.901\n                       130 / 1.901",

    "entry": "This time of year, I (and doubtless others), as if on cue, begin having anxiety dreams\nabout school. In my latest one, I am taking a very difficult history test for which I'm\nwoefully unprepared (lots of other 'busy-ness' had interfered with my plan to reread the\ncourse textbook cover to cover). The test consisted, in part, of twelve short\nessays/analyses (with a word limit) based on images. The one image that I knew I could\nwrite of ton about what that of Vercingetorix, the Gallic chief who resisted valiantly yet\nultimately unsuccessfully against the invading Romans (a metaphor for fighting the\n                       132 / 1.901\n'invading' cancer cells??). I planned to write about V. as a shape-shifting signifier,\nportrayed as either a 'national' hero by Plutarch or a brave yet undisciplined barbarian\nby Caesar. Another image featured a woman's hands reaching into a case where pies\nwere displayed (like in a diner), which I thought I could link to post-World War II\nAmerican middle-class consumer culture! In any event, I was making check marks by the\nimages I thought I might write about (and struggling to identify twelve), when Lynn Hunt,\na very prominent American historian of France, leaned over to me and said: \"There really\nare a lot of good choices this year, aren't there? It's a good exam.\" Yikes. A second part\nof the exam was a long, DBQ (document-based question), involving synthesizing and\nanalyzing a lot of information and documents about...coal. The third part consisted of\nmany short identifications of extremely specific names, places, and works, most of which\nI hadn't a clue about. I thought I recognized a section of quotation by Victor Hugo, about\nthe plight of the urban poor during mid-19th century industrialization, but I couldn't\nremember the title nor the date, and knew that I'd need to fudge it. Good grief.\nWhile I have had variants of this dream many times (yet few as vivid), this year I really\n*am* unprepared. Normally at this time, I'd be writing syllabi, setting up reserve reading\nlists, arranging visits to the Rare Book Room and Palmer Museum of Art, meeting with\nstudents, preparing for our new graduate student orientation, and getting caught up in\nthe adrenaline rush of back to school. But I won't be doing any of that because I'm on\nmedical leave until January. So naturally I feel woefully 'out of sync,' 'off course,' my\nnatural instincts foiled or rerouted. It's depressing, and I am working on coming to peace\nwith my 'new normal' once school begins. I'm also figuring out how to structure my time\nmeaningfully and thinking about what kind of work (ie writing/research) I may be able to\naccomplish. And of course I need to keep in mind the bottom line - ie my treatment and\nrecovery - which will allow me to get back to all the rest as soon as possible. And\nfocusing on my health requires a lot of time and energy.\nGetting ready to go to Baltimore tomorrow (I'll return on Wednesday). I'll have a CT scan\nto determine whether my stomach abscess has completely healed. If so, I may be able to\nstop taking both the two antibiotics that have been shredding my stomach for at least a\nmonth and the anti-fungal medicine that it takes me over an hour to administer to\nmyself daily. I am crossing my fingers here. I'll also get to meet briefly with Dr. Beavis,\nmy surgeon who is overseeing my care, and Dr. Mehta, who is treating the stomach\nabscess. In much better news, Ben will come from DC so we can have dinner together on\nTuesday and he'll also spend the night at the Residence Inn before heading back to work\non Wednesday morning. I'm scouting around for restaurant recommendations and am\nthinking red-sauce Italian in Little Italy, as long as the food is good!\nLast night with my friend Helen I saw the film \"The Farewell,\" about the matriarch of a\nChinese family who is diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. The family agrees to hide this\nnews from her, and everyone is \"all in\" except her Chinese-American granddaughter,\nwho lives in New York. It's a quirky film, and I haven't yet decided if I liked it (although\n                       133 / 1.901\nI'm definitely glad I saw it). It seemed to not be able to make up its mind about whether\nit was a comedy or a drama. The decision to not tell the grandmother that she was dying\nwas presented as culturally determined (is that really the case?), and the entire family\nseemed to trade in many forms of keeping up appearances, 'good lies,' and denial. I\ndefinitely don't think I'd want to be kept in the dark about a terminal cancer diagnosis\nthough (one character in the film points out that in the States this might be illegal...), as\ntraumatizing as that might be.\nHave a good week, everyone.",
    "comments": "Wow, Willa, what an amazing dream life -- Lynn Hunt and challenging DBQs and the\nRoman Empire! I haven't seen \"The Farewell\" yet, but what I heard is that the\ngrandmother has outlived all expectations and went to see the movie when it came out\nin China! I wonder what her reaction was to it? I hope everything goes well in Baltimore\nand that you will be off all of the medications sooner rather than later. Enjoy dinner with\nBen! Sending love from Maine.\n  \u2014Sally Charnow, August 19, 2019  \nYou have incredible dreams! Thank you for sharing them in such vivid detail\u2014maybe you\nare already writing your book? These blogs are gorgeous to read. Hugs as you get ready\nto go to Baltimore! So happy Ben can join xo\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, August 19, 2019  \nI'll keep my fingers crossed for good news from the CT scan tomorrow -- it would be\nwonderful if you were able to get off those meds and simplify your daily routine! Thanks\nfor the vivid and highly entertaining dream sequences: that made my day. XXOO, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, August 19, 2019  \nExtraordinary recall of your dream, and exquisite writing on the topic. You continue to\namaze!

Enjoy time with Ben and know I am cheering you on\nfrom afar.\n  \u2014Aileen Galley, August 19, 2019  \nA big OMG, Willa. Are those answers to exam questions or book proposals? In my\n                       134 / 1.901\nretirement dreams, I have mostly been \u00e0 poils teaching French 101.\nThe nightmarish part is that the students don't even seem to notice. The University of\nArkansas, so oh well.\nI loved The Farewell. Even the New Yorker film critic liked it. I was impressed by the\nimportance of family, including the shame of having left the grandmother alone.\nThe condo, the barbecue, the live music, my man's TexMex are all waiting in Austin.\nCome on down as soon as you can and bless your heart.\n  \u2014Jim Davis, August 19, 2019  \nI wholeheartedly agree: \"Maybe you are already writing your book ...\" Woven together,\nyour journal entries would make a stupendous read -- as they each do separately\nalready. Bravo for you that any meds you're taking clearly haven't affected your dazzling\nmind and creativity one iota! Fascinating, beautiful words the lot (and much more\ncompelling than the same \"performance\" dream some of us still have about high school!)\nYour work misses you, too, and will be waiting for you! Enjoy cherishing Ben in\nBaltimore! xxxxxxoooooo\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, August 19, 2019  \nThe tests you've been taking in your dreams \"Back to School\" and whether or not to\nkeep the truth from Grandmother remind me of the reaction poll you asked the class to\ntake about Muslim girls wearing head scarves in school, of which I'm still thinking . For\nyou, learning and teaching are far removed from a series of facts! Thank you for\nexploring these timely issues! Have a good day at the hospital and a super visit with\nBen!

    "entry": "I am rejoicing in two pieces of good news today, both related to the CT scan I had\nyesterday at Hopkins. First the scan revealed, for the time being, no evidence of new\ncancer. Among other things, this means that I can 'stay the course' with my treatment,\nagain for now, as opposed to the doctors having to think about new chemo drugs if the\ncurrent ones were proving ineffective. Second, the scan indicates that my stomach\n                       135 / 1.901\nabscess has healed! This means far less risk of an infection compromising my potentially\nfragile immune system, with consequences for my chemo regimen. It also means that I\ncan stop taking the two antibiotics and one anti-fungal medication that I've been\ndiligently taking for about two months and that are wreaking havoc on my stomach! And\nso, for now, goodbye to the iv pole that's been my companion every day for over an hour\nas I administer the micafungin.\nSo all in all, a good visit to Hopkins. I was clearly anxious (\"scanxious\"), as my back\nstarted to spasm every time I started thinking about receiving the scan results. I am very\nglad that I was able to speak with Dr. Beavis, who is overseeing my care and who\nperformed my debulking surgery. We resolved some practical issues, such as whether I\ncan delay until December my yearly mammogram for fear it might irritate my port\n(answer: yes) and the timetable for our next appointments. She also helped me\nunderstand much more clearly the 'fluidity' of the notion of prognosis. She's been over\nthe aggregate data with me several times, ie 80% of women with ovarian cancer go into\nremission after standard chemotherapy treatment. On the flip side, most ovarian cancer\npatients will have a recurrence at some point following initial treatment. The averages\nfor patients treated at Hopkins appear to be more favorable (not unsurprisingly) - these\nare averages. But then there is also each patient's individualized path, including whether\nor not certain 'milestones' are met (ie patients whose cancer recurs during treatment v.\nthose whose cancer does not; patients who mark x months/years without a recurrence,\nwith each increment being significant). Down the road options with recurrences (likely in\nthe abdominal area again) would include more surgery and/or chemo. Sooo... while I\nrealize that I am still very much 'on the journey,' and while there will certainly be many\nmore scans upcoming, I was still happy for today's news. Every bit of good news counts.\nBetter than the alternative, certainly.\nAfter a very good talk with Dr. Beavis, I had my CT scan. I was glad to have a highly\nexperienced technician I like (I think his name is Bill), who administers the contrast dye\nslowly so that I don't feel the sudden freezing cold \"whoosh\" of the injection, which\nimmediately fills the mouth with a salty, metallic taste. The two times Bill was not my\ntechnician, I got sick to my stomach after the scan. Bill also knew to position my arms by\nmy sides (rather than over my head), which also helped. And he's a PSU wrestling fan\ntoo!\nI don't know what possessed me to walk about half an hour back from the hospital to the\nhotel in 95 degree heat, but somehow I managed to do it, slipping into the air\nconditioning of a Starbucks for an iced cappuccino along the way.\nToday's meeting was with Dr. Mehta, the infectious diseases specialist, who gave me the\ngood news about the scan.\nLast night Ben took the commuter train from DC to Baltimore so we could have dinner\n                       136 / 1.901\nand he could stay in the hotel with me overnight. We had a great time. We opted for\nclassic Italian in Little Italy and chose a restaurant called La Scala, which did not\ndisappoint in the least! We split a Caesar salad (grade: A, and I'm a hard one to please),\nwith a tangy homemade dressing infused with lemon, anchovies and high grade\nParmesan, and ultra-crisp Romaine. I opted for spaghetti (more like bucatini) carbonara,\nas my taste buds are tending to favor creamy (yogurt, ice cream, avocados, cream) and\nsweet over dry and savory (eg a hamburger) these days. Although my taste is clearly a\nbit off, I could tell it was delicious, and I ate most of it. Ben had shrimp Fra Diavolo, which\nhe loved. After dinner we walked to Vaccaro's, a legendary Little Italy bakery, and picked\nup some cannoli and cookies, which we indulged in while watching two episodes of a\nnew (?) cooking/travel show with Gordon Ramsay. Ramsay is no Anthony Bourdain (but\nwho could ever be?); nevertheless, Ben and I enjoyed watching him cook with unusual\ningredients (camel, anyone?) while travelling around with the 'locals' in Morocco and\nHawaii.\nMy efforts to try to make amends for our President by telling Baltimoreans how much I\nappreciate their city met with (very) mixed success. The first person to whom I\nproclaimed \"I love Baltimore!,\" the front desk manager at the hotel, simply smiled and\nsaid \"thank you.\" The second, a maintenance worker at the hotel, said in response: \"I\nhate Baltimore. I can't wait to get back to California, where I'm from.\" The third person, a\nclerk registering me for my CT scan at Hopkins, gushed enthusiastically about Baltimore,\nhis home town, and the fourth, an Uber driver, simply responded \"Crickets\" (ie no\nresponse/enough said). Ben wisely encouraged me, despite my well-meaning instincts,\nnot to try to 'save' Baltimoreans single-handedly. As I can attest, they're doing just fine,\nthank you very much.\nOn my return from Baltimore just a while ago, I found a gorgeous bouquet from my\nfriend Cheryl (to whom I will write to thank shortly). What a kind gesture, and what a\nlovely gift to come home to after a whirlwind trip!",

    "entry": "I spent part of yesterday at the hospital in Lewistown (about 25 miles from here), to\nmeet with a genetic counselor, Tara Schmidlen, and then have the actual testing done. I\nwas annoyed that the counselor did not seem to know if I even needed this 'germline'\ntesting (as opposed to the tumor testing done following my surgery) because she could\nnot access all the pertinent records from Hopkins. I imagine that this frustrating situation\narises when several doctors in several facilities are involved in the care of one patient,\nbut still... When I was having the bloodwork done, however, Tara came racing down to\nthe lab to let me know that she had spoken to Dr. Beavis' nurse and I did, indeed, still\nneed to have the germline testing done. So the confusion was resolved in the end.\nTesting on this panel of 20 genes (and ultimately as many as 84 genes, should I choose)\nwill help my doctors determine which drugs will be the most effective for my post-chemo\nmaintenance treatment. Further, the testing may even impact my current chemo\nregimen. Given that my mother is BRCA negative (ie her BReast CAncer does not appear\nto have been inherited but the result of a genetic mutation), chances are that my\novarian cancer also resulted from a random genetic mutation as well... which is why I\nsometimes say not \"Why me?\" but rather \"Why not me?\" Cancer seems such a Russian\nroulette sometimes.\nI rewarded myself for that trip over the mountains to Lewistown with a mint flake ice\ncream cone (ice cream being one of the staples of my diet now, it would seem). And I\nhad to rest when I got home. A fifty mile round-trip drive would not normally tire me out,\nbut I do tire more easily than usual these days. I rebounded sufficiently to make it to\nservices, where the phrase \"steadfast spirit\" stuck with me from the evening's readings.\nThis morning a nurse came over to deaccess my port as I am no longer administering the\nmicafungin daily through it. So for now no more large, unsightly patch covering my port\nbut a simple bandaid. After that, I shopped at Trader Joe's and the farmers market,\nwhere I ran into a Jewish Studies colleague who didn't know I had been diagnosed with\ncancer (holding his understandably troubled reaction caused me some stress). Then\n                       139 / 1.901\nhome to prepare a few things for a lovely lunch with a colleague, Cheryl, who had also\nshown concern when she learned about my health challenge and was kind enough to\nvisit. Again after that sequence of events, I needed to rest a bit but am supposed to go\nout for dinner and music later with my friends Mar and Jessica.\nI went to school last week for the first time since May, when I left my office in a panicked\nflurry after receiving my initial diagnosis by phone. I received a very warm welcome from\nstaff, a colleague or two (although none of my own departmental colleagues were\naround), and a grad student. Big hugs all around. My plan is to stay connected by\nattending defenses, book parties, lectures and other events on campus, as my health\nallows. Fading away completely this semester will be too depressing, and it might even\nbe helpful for my colleagues to see me too.\nLooking forward to a few nice lunches this week, including with the remaining two \"III\nCs,\" Jan and Jackie, whom I didn't meet the first time when I had lunch with Helen and\nDeb. So grateful for the nearby presence of these 'sisters,' all long-term OC survivors,\nand eager to speak with them. Next round of chemo: this coming Thursday.",

Like Helen and Deb\nwhom I met over lunch a few weeks ago, Jackie and Jan (see pic) were both very kind,\ngenerous in sharing their experiences, affirming, and encouraging. Both are long-term\nsurvivors, full of pep, who lead extremely active lives (Jackie, originally from Scotland,\ntakes yoga, Zumba, cycling and strength training classes at the Y while Jan walks daily\nand winters in Florida). Both had recurrences of their ovarian cancer -- which will be the\nlikelihood for me as well -- which meant more chemo, but both got through it. And at\nleast one of them also had breast cancer following ovarian cancer. Both appear to be\nfully in remission now, and for quite a number of years. They both seem to be living their\nbest lives, embracing and practicing the 'no day but today' message.\nI was especially grateful to have lunch with them today as it's the first day of the new\nschool year and I feel a bit sad and depressed that I'm not part of it. The lunch helped, as\ndid a visit from my friend and colleague, Nancy. I look forward to two more lunches with\nfriends before chemo on Thursday. I'm sure once I get into a new rhythm with some\nstructure-providing activities (I'm looking into a new gym), I'll feel better. And I definitely\nthink I made the right decision taking a medical leave this semester, giving myself ample\ntime/space to devote to my treatment and recovery. It's hard for me to imagine how I\nwould have handled the rigors of my job with my ongoing chemo treatments,\nprocedures, medical appointments, fatigue etc.\nI asked Jackie and Jan what it felt like to be 'on the other side' of their cancer journey.\nJackie said that she now views the active treatment phase as \"another life,\" firmly in the\npast. Both of them seemed to me clearly anchored in the \"new normal,\" or the \"new old\nnormal,\" slipping easily from accounts of their diagnosis and treatment into more\npresent concerns and pastimes: gardening, travel, grandchildren. A friend suggested --\nand this hadn't really occurred to me -- that I may be, ironically, in a sort of \"love\" stage\nof my journey, marked by both an outpouring of love from those around me that feels\nlike a healing balm and my own narcissistic love of -- or perhaps rather obsession with --\nmy own disease, which feels all-consuming. I can't even imagine what it will feel like to\nbe on the other side of this. I suppose -- and I hope -- that I'll find out.",

This could include\nnotably high/low numbers on the lab work I have done right before treatment;\nindications that the treatment is ineffective; a bad cold or infection (such as the recently-\nhealed abscess in my stomach). There is so much uncertainty on this journey, and it's\nhard to sit with that, although I am trying extra hard to take good care of myself with a\nhealthy diet, lots of sleep, avoidance of big crowds and of kissing/hugging anyone with a\ncold etc. Common sense measures.\nBut today things went smoothly, although I was not pleased to wake up at 6:15 a.m for a\n7:15 appointment, to which my kind neighbor Janis drove me.

The seven+ hours went pretty quickly between\nsome time to rest, read and send texts and heartening visits from friends. In the\nmorning, my dear friend Gay came to chat for a while. I also got a quick hug from\nRhonda, my wonderful mentor/friend/angel/fellow survivor from the Hopkins\nWoman2Woman support organization for OC survivors and those beginning or going\nthrough treatment (see pic). In the afternoon, my lovely friend Helen came to visit,\nbearing a vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy. Actually, I was not really supposed to eat\nthis as my glucose level is high (a result of taking ten steroid pills last night and this\nmorning). But when the nurse said \"everything in moderation\" (partially overriding what\nmy doctor had said), I couldn't resist the soothing, creamy, sugary deliciousness of the\nmilkshake. Mea culpa. So much for healthy diet thus far today but I'll compensate at\ndinnertime with some broth-based carrot soup and an avocado.\nThe rabid Trumpian was not there today. As a precaution, like last time I selected a\ntreatment bay that is set apart from all the others. Also, all the nurses are extremely\ncapable, solicitous and caring, which helps reduce anxiety around the treatment.\nAfter I had finished, Helen and I made a quick pit stop at the Amish produce stand on the\nway back to my house, where I bought some beets, zucchini and eggplant to buttress\nother healthy/healthier food choices. By the time I got home I was tired and needed to\nrest for a while.\nHeartfelt thanks to friends and family members who sent notes and texts of\nencouragement and left a goodie bag for me on my return from chemo (!). In no way\nwhatsoever did I expect this, but I very much appreciate these caring acts. Thanks to\neveryone indulging me by reading my journal, which is proving quite therapeutic for me.\nLunches with my dear friends Kathryn (Tuesday) and Clare and Lisa (Wednesday) and a\nvisit and dessert exchange (plum clafoutis for peach compote) with Chris were also lots\nof fun!\n                       146 / 1.901\nI did, in the end, buy the dresser at Pier1 that I thought would be perfect for my bedroom\nand much more proportional than my previous dresser. It also matches two little end\ntables in my bedroom also purchased at Pier1 a few years ago. So, living by the mantra\nof \"life is short; buy the dresser,\" I enlisted the help of \"Team Truglio/Fox\" (my dear\nfriend Maria, fiance Greg and son Anthony) to move this *large and heavy* dresser in a\ntruck I rented for this purpose (the store would not deliver). Their combination of muscle\npower and logistical savvy allowed them to pull off this feat without a hitch. And I'm\nloving my dresser! Planning a few other upgrades to my condo this fall as well.\nCan't wait to see Ben and Sammi this Sunday-Monday as they are coming up for the long\nweekend. I will most likely be crashed out from chemo (if I follow the pattern of days 3-4\npost-chemo being the worst), but I've already cooked and frozen some cream of tomato\nsoup and will make a few more dishes ahead of time. I know that they will be\nunderstanding and helpful and it will be great to spend time with them. \nPhotos\n                       147 / 1.901\n                       148 / 1.901",

I felt well enough on\nThursday evening and all Friday, and made it to services on Friday night. But yesterday I\nwas hit with crushing fatigue, accompanied by tingling in my fingers, aches in my neck,\narms and legs, and an upset stomach. I took some anti-nausea meds but don't feel that\nnauseous. All in all, I think the symptoms may be worse this time than the two previous\n                       149 / 1.901\nones.

I wish they didn't have to see me this way.\nI'm trying to just roll with it - there's no choice - but the situation is depressing and\nmakes me really hate this disease. I would much rather have been out enjoying the nice\nweather and festive atmosphere around town with our first home game taking place, or\nelse in Arizona at a conference I was supposed to attend with many of my former\nstudents (who nicely sent pictures of what looked like a great gathering). These crashes\nare a bit hard to manage without a 'caregiver' but I'm bearing up. And I'm\nhoping/expecting to start feeling better tomorrow, if the usual pattern holds. Clawing\nmyself out of such a deep hole of fatigue seems daunting, but I trust in my capacity to\nrebound and will allow myself as much space as I need to rest.\nThanks for the good thoughts, everyone.",

If you are\nunderstandably not up for a visitor on the days you crash, perhaps you could schedule a\nvisiting nurse to visit on those days.

    "entry": "152 / 1.901\n                       153 / 1.901\nSome people seem to find me courageous, even inspiring. I'm sure to many that's the\nmore appealing version of my 'cancer self.' I certainly don't always feel courageous nor\ncan I or anyone else always expect me to be. Not when I was wincing in pain yesterday\nbecause my lower GI track felt inflamed and throbbing (seems better today after a diet\nof yogurt, a banana and some cheese but Dr. Patel says if symptoms get worse I should\ngo to ER for evaluation). And not when I read the many harrowing accounts of women\ndealing with multiple recurrences on a Facebook page called Sisterhood of Ovarian\nCancer Survivors. It's been hard to gird on a shield of courage the past 3-4 days because\nthe effects of round 3 of chemo were so wretched, leaving me feeling not only exhausted\nbut also vulnerable and deflated. I realize that in my last post I may have been pulling\nfor some sympathy. Thank you for indulging me.\nBen and Sammi, visiting from DC, were extremely kind, understanding and helpful,\nalthough I felt badly that I couldn't host them in the way I'm used to. I had done some\ncooking before chemo, but they also cooked up some eggs for breakfast, washed all the\ndishes and tidied up the kitchen. I had just enough energy on Sunday to take a drive\nalong a pretty country road to The Hummingbird Room, a local restaurant/caterer\nsituated in an old farmhouse in Spring Mills. The co-owner, Eric Sarnow (formerly of Le\nBec Fin, in Philly) is a fabulous chef and every so often he and his wife stock up a big red\nbarn behind the house with some of their specialty items for purchase. We bought some\ndelicious salmon roe mousse, to-die-for chocolate sauce for ice cream, and granola, and\nsnagged a bag of peaches for free on the way out, which later I cooked into compote. On\nMonday, we enjoyed ice cream cones and sundaes at Meyer Dairy (perhaps no wonder a\nstomach ache resulted?). The rest of the weekend was mellow -- I rested, Ben and\nSammi went to the game, grocery shopped at Trader Joe's, and went for a run. In the\nevening we watched episodes of The Great British Baking Show. It was very comforting\nhaving them here.\nToday my stomach was hurting in the morning, so I stayed in bed late, annoyed at\nmyself that I couldn't get up earlier. I have to keep reminding myself that self-care has to\nbe my priority, whatever that takes. With that in mind, today I luxuriated in a hot stone\npedicure and spa manicure at a local day spa that Ben had treated me to for my bday in\nMarch (thanks to a gift certificate). The technician spent over two hours indulging me in\nparaffin treatments for my hands, rubbing my legs with hot stones (which really helped\nmy bone pain!) and my arms with bergamot-scented oil, and painting my nails a pretty\n'orchid' color I had picked up in Paris and that I thought worked well for late summer. :)\nWhen I came home I took a walk. I need to build up my strength after being so wiped out\nfor several days - and the weather's beautiful.\nI'm really hoping to continue to feel better tomorrow.\n                       154 / 1.901\nPhotos\n                       155 / 1.901\n                       156 / 1.901",

The unpleasant prep includes drinking\ntwo bottles of a barium solution before my appointment at 2:30. Cause is unclear: effects\nof chemo drugs? inflammation noted on a previous CT scan but that is in my small\nintestine, not my lower GI track (that CT scan did not reveal evidence of a fistula or\nadhesion to abdominal wall, which would be much more serious)? Infection?\nHemorrhoid? Continuing effects of the 'mother of all surgeries' that I had performed in\nMay? New cancer (Dr. Beavis noted that chances of this happening during chemo are\nactually <5%)? So.much.uncertainty. Ditto for treatment options: at one end of the\nspectrum, whatever the issue may be may resolve on its own. On the other: surgical\nintervention might be needed (please, no).

    "entry": "As I wrote in my last post, some stomach discomfort led my doctors to order an\nabdominal and pelvic CT scan, which I had yesterday. That scan revealed, as I learned\ntoday, a new abscess in my stomach. What I was not expecting was to be told by my\ndoctors that they were recommending a new hospital stay of 5-7 days so that I can\nreceive IV antibiotics (first, they will have to determine what type of infection it is) and\nhave the abscess drained. Obviously, I was pretty shocked by this news and dismayed by\nthe thought of another hospital stay. I was initially given the choice between staying in\nthe hospital here in State College, where I have a large support network, or going back to\nHopkins. In the end, though, it turns out that the local hospital does not have the kind of\nspecialized personnel that may be needed. So tomorrow it's back to Hopkins. I am very\nmuch hoping that my next chemo infusion on 9/19 will not need to be delayed but that\nremains to be seen. If the abscess does not resolve with antibiotics and drainage, a\nsurgical intervention is possible, in which the abscess would be removed surgically.\nThe situation sucks, but I'm soldiering on.

    "entry": "Feeling very deflated when I wrote my last post two days ago, I thought ahead to titling\nthis one \u201cBack to Black,\u201d after a particularly grim song by Amy Winehouse. But since I\ntend to be pretty resilient and am in a better place today, I\u2019m calling it, simply, \u201cAt\nHopkins,\u201d which reflects the reality of the situation.\n                       161 / 1.901\nI had what I\u2019m describing to myself as some shade of PTSD-ish symptoms returning to\nWeinberg 4B yesterday, after I was admitted to the hospital: flashbacks to 2 a.m.\nprocedures, having my lung drained of 2 liters of fluid, waking up in the ICU after a\nthirteen-hour surgery, and pain, pain. But as soon as I got to my room I was greeted by\nKendall and Delores, two of the outstanding nurses (Kendall) and technicians (Delores)\nwho took care of me so well last time. They complimented me on my nail color and we\nimmediately started dishing about my nails and rings. They said I looked great (and\ncompared to when I was last here in May, I do). Today another favorite nurse, Kris, is\nhere. She loves the Tait Farm harvest shop in State College so today we talked about\nrecipes we make with their products! Nurses are extraordinary professionals, and\nHopkins\u2019 are some of the best.\nMy medical team had a plan in place for me by the time I arrived. I am receiving two\nantibiotics via IV drip. A doctor from infectious diseases came to see me and explained\ncertain things to me very thoroughly (eg how the abscess may have formed). Tomorrow\nI\u2019ll meet with doctors from interventional radiology. I may or may not have a drainage\ntube placed in my stomach (again) to help drain the abscess, which is smaller than the\nlast one and in a different location. But they also need to get a culture from the abscess\nto find out which more targeted antibiotics I might need. It takes a few days to grow and\ntest the culture. My blood was tested and thankfully no infection was detected in the\nbloodstream.\nBeyond that, though, much is uncertain. Can antibiotics (whichever ones I\u2019ll be taking, in\nthe end) be taken orally, or will they need to be administered solely via IV? This may\nhave repercussions for how soon I can go home...How long will it take for the abscess to\nheal? Will I develop another one? Most importantly (for me), will I be able to have my\nnext chemo infusion next Thursday, as planned? Will my white blood cell count hold\nsteady (those cells are fighting both the cancer and the infection at this point)? How long\nwill I be here? I\u2019m holding out for 5-7 days but none of this seems straightforward. I\u2019m on\nthe narrow bridge, for sure (or maybe a secondary narrow bridge that is an offshoot of\nthe primary one). But the most important thing is not to *give in to the fear, not to\ndespair.*\n \nMy day was wholly redeemed by a visit from Ben. He took time out of his busy day (he\u2019s\nleaving for a business trip tomorrow) to come spend a few hours with me. His hugs and\njust his presence made me feel so much better. He is, without doubt, a mensch (and has\nhad a few excellent models in this area). We had a snack, chatted, and watched sports \u2013\nGiants-Cowboys (Ben\u2019s choice), US Open men\u2019s final (my choice). My dear brother,\n                       162 / 1.901\nEthan, is also coming from New York tomorrow to spend a few days with me. I asked him\nto bring me a raisin bagel from the city.\nGetting to sleep was a bit hard last night, anticipating several \u2018wake-ups\u2019 throughout the\nnight. I miss my bed, and my freedom and autonomy. But this is where I need to be now,\nand the care I\u2019m receiving is, as usual, first-rate. To fight off insomnia, I\ndecorated/renovated each room of a fantasy country house and then planned fun social\ngatherings there.\nPlease excuse any typos or even minor grammar errors herein. Am only practicing \u2018light\nediting\u2019 on these posts!\nThis song is kind of my anthem these days. Please listen if you have a minute. Maybe it\nwill mean something to you, too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3Hhky1yLkM\nLove and hugs,",

    "entry": "I spent a frustrating day yesterday waiting to have a stomach drain placement\nprocedure. This involved my fasting, in the end, for nearly 24 hours! Around 5 p.m.,\nhowever, one of the gynoc doctors came to my room to tell me that, despite my being on\nthe schedule, the procedure couldn't take place as planned: interventional radiology had\nbecome too backed up over the course of the day, in part with emergent cases. As a\nconsequence of waiting all day, however, I was at that point \"higher up in the queue\" for\nthe next day (ie today). There is so much waiting involved during hospital stays, I've\nlearned. Fortunately, I am patient but this experience was unnerving.\nMy recompense was to be taken to interventional radiology for my procedure at 7:30\na.m. today. I was lightly sedated for the short procedure, which went well, and awoke to\nfind a drainage tube and bag dangling from an incision in my stomach, as I had towards\nthe end of my hospital stay in May. Not the most pleasant memory. The procedure also\nbrought some unexpected, and not welcome news: while doing a sonogram during the\nprocedure, the doctors discovered a fistula or hole/perforation between my bowel and\nmy stomach. This could actually be the cause of the abscesses I've been developing and\nis therefore an important diagnostic piece of information. But the fistula, although\npinpoint sized, has to be repaired, and apparently there are several ways of doing this. I\n                       164 / 1.901\ndo not yet know what the 'plan' is; my surgeon, Dr. Beavis, will consult with\ninterventional radiology and likely other doctors and come up with something workable,\ntaking into account the other variables (my chemo timetable, distance that I travel to get\nto Baltimore, timing of the two procedures relative to one another etc.). I should know\nmore tomorrow morning.\nOf course I feel frustrated and like I'm 'backsliding.' I feel somewhat deflated by the\n'bumps in the road' I've had to deal with, while knowing that chemo treatment is not\nalways straightforward and can be interrupted by low white blood cell count, infections,\ncolds etc. I'm committed to staying strong and maintaining a forward-looking attitude.\nAnd the medical team is fully behind me on this. \nI feel badly to put such strain on my mother, brother and Ben. I feel guilty about\ngenerating so much worrisome 'trouble.' I wish it could be otherwise. It's such a drag.\nA bright light through all this was the opportunity to spend two days hanging with my\nbrother, which I rarely if ever get to do. Over the course of many hours, we moved easily\nbetween catching each other up on our lives and kids' lives, and reminiscing about the\npenny candy store in Amherst, MA, where we spent a few summers growing up; Auggie's\n(as Ethan thinks it was called) was the source of root beer barrels, dots, hot balls and\nmany other childhood treats. I'm so grateful to Ethan for being here the past few days.\np.s. Dr. Beavis and another doctor came by about 6:30 p.m. and we talked for about an\nhour. As she always does, she laid out very clearly the various options and scenarios\nregarding repair of the fistula in relation to my chemo. I will know more over the next\nfew days. This will not be convenient, nor pleasant, and the logistics will be tricky, but it\nwill hopefully bring me a few steps closer to healing and should also not compromise my\nchemo schedule significantly, which is the most important thing. I felt better after\nspeaking with them.",
    "comments": "Dear Willa, Your resilience and positive attitude continue to inspire me. I remember when\nmy dad was dealing with cancer treatments\u2014and this was awhile back, as I was writing\nmy dissertation then\u2014it seemed as if every time there was a procedure and an\nexplanation that \"there is a chance there will be X complication,\" we had it.

You are a gift.\n  \u2014Jane Ginsberg, September 10, 2019  \nMa chere Willa, you've been through so much and now more. You are tolerating the\nbumps with patience and grace. I'm sorry that you have to go through yet another\nhospital stay and a surgery to repair the fistula. But, what a relief to discover that the\nfistula might have caused the abscesses and can be fixed. I love surgeons ;-) especially\nwhen they are outstanding like your Dr. Beavis or my foot surgeon Dr. Drakos ;-)\nHandsome or charming helps, too ;-)\nIt's a drag that you're back in the hospital but thank G-d it's not because radiology found\ncancer but a stupid abscess! When I read that, I was so relieved.\nAfter a 24-hour fast, I would have become delirious and angry and I would have yelled at\neveryone in the hospital and demanded to what their strategy was to avoid that from\never happening to another patient. Does that fasting episode count toward Yom Kippour?\n;-) I hope someone brought you something incredibly delicious like a milkshake ;-)\nDon't expend energy feeling bad about imposing upon your mother, brother and son. For\nsure, they're grateful that you're still alive and they have the privilege of spending time\nwith and doing things for you. Don't go into that negative space. Take in and hold onto\nthe love. Serieusement.\nYou're really doing so well. I misplaced the paper with your Hebrew name on it. Please\ngive it to me again. I love and miss you! Harriet\n  \u2014Harriet Jackson, September 10, 2019  \nHaving a possible cause for the recurring abscess is heartening news, even though it will\ntemporarily interfere with the smooth trajectory of your other treatments. All said, this is\na minor setback in the great scheme of things, and once it's repaired, you can get back\nto your 'regular program'. Of course, it would be good if they could keep you decently\nfed along the way: I'd have been sooo grumpy to have had to endure a 24-hour fast!!\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, September 10, 2019  \n                       166 / 1.901\nDear Willa\nThinking of you with so much love\u2014I really appreciate your beautiful card that came\ntoday\u2014and I also appreciate you keeping all those who love you up to date on your\njourney\u2014I so hope the next few days will bring some resolution as you continue to go\nforward in your treatment.

This intervention will be quick recovery,\nprob more antibiotics and youll be home before you know it. We are \"choosen\" because\nhashem knows our people can take burdens. :) And yes, this counts towards fast for Yom\nKippur!\n  \u2014Samantha Burman, September 11, 2019  \nBravo to you, my precious cousin, for handling this temporary setback with such grace.\nLike some other writers here, I'm a wimp when it comes to fasting and am awed by your\nresilience. Even skipping lunch can make me truly delirious (gotten worse with age ...)\nand beyond cranky! Yeegads, you put me to shame in so many ways, my dear! Like\nothers, I also encourage you not to spend a nanosecond worrying about your beloved\nmother and brother. Having known them my entire life, I see how truly caring they've\nalways been, and know for a fact they're happy and grateful to be a source of comfort\nand strength for you! Please keep that in mind always. The love that you all share is\nunbreakable.\nAh, the deliciously \"sweet\" memory of Amherst -- a blissful image to hold onto! While\nreading, I suddenly had a wonderful flashback of that super-special place while walking\naround town under the warm sun of early summer.\nYour doctor who spent an hour talking to you continues to sound extraordinary. I am so\nthankful that you have her on your team, and also feel never-ending gratitude for your\nunceasing, exceptionally insightful journal entries.\nAs someone else put it, you GOT this, kiddo. Indeed you do. You'll soon be back at home\nafter this blip, with the source of the infections now known and fixed, on your way to full\nhealing. xxxxxxoooooo\n                       167 / 1.901\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, September 11, 2019  \nGood luck with that fistula.

    "entry": "After a week here, I am being discharged tomorrow! Dr. Beavis, in consultation with\nseveral other doctors (Mehta, the infectious disease specialist; Patel, my oncologist in\nState College; Lyons, the interventional radiologist; and Stone, another gynoc surgeon\nwho told Beavis she had had a patient who presented a case similar to mine), developed\na new (or revised plan): the fistula will not be actively attended to until I finish my final\nround of chemo. The reasoning is that I should be 'covered' between the two antibiotics\nI'll be taking daily through IV (micafungin and Invanz) and the tube that is draining the\nabscess in my stomach. This means, of course, that I'll be back to self-administering the\nantibiotics and draining the abscess daily, for the next ten week. This is time-consuming\nand laborious but I'LL TAKE IT. Hopefully, the fistula might close on its own. Conversely,\nit could also get bigger (but hopefully will not). If it's not resolved by the time I finish\nchemo, I may well need a procedure in which a small plug is inserted subcutaneously\ninto the fistula, to close it. The other option would be a more invasive surgery, which I\ndefinitely want to avoid. Fortunately, my next chemo treatment will only be delayed four\ndays, until Sept. 23rd and should not interfere with my Rosh Hashana plans. All in all,\nthen, I think this is a very good outcome, especially as I can have my next chemo\ninfusion a week from Monday.\nAs usual, Dr. Beavis was thoroughly on top of the situation, coordinating its different\nparts into a well-thought out plan. She is thorough and careful, smart, empathic and\nupbeat. She also spent about an hour with me two evenings ago and half an hour or so\ntoday, in my room, explaining all angles of the plan clearly and answering my questions.\nI continue to feel grateful for my great good fortune in being under her care.\nI find being in the hospital difficult. While hospitals are places where miraculous\ndevelopments occur, where people are cared for, survive and thrive, and show great\nstrength of spirit even in their weakness and vulnerability, on my worst days I felt the\nprison analogy -- loss of freedom and autonomy, restrictions and constraints, lack of\n                       168 / 1.901\ncomfort, separation from the 'real world' -- more appropriate. I find it hard sometimes to\nkeep my spirits up, although the nurses are all extremely kind and skillful, and texts and\nnotes from friends certainly helped (not to mention visits from Ben and my brother\nEthan). I do not mean to sound ungrateful as I feel unbelievably fortunate for the care\nI'm receiving, and usually manage to remain chipper. Yet I will be so relieved to be home\ntomorrow and certainly hope there will be no cause for another trip here before my next\nscheduled appointments on on Oct. 22nd.\nI did distract myself by plunging into an excellent book that my reading group will be\ntaking up next week (happily, I should be able to make that meeting after missing a\ncouple of previous ones): _Educated_ by Tara Westover (an astonishing memoir about a\nyoung woman's struggle to craft a new identity following a highly singular upbringing in\na survivalist family in rural Idaho). I also welcomed visits from Rhonda, a wonderful\nchaplain here. I believe she's a Methodist pastor but her approach is ecumenical. We\njoined in prayers for healing and for tomorrow's travel, extending them over my 'loving\nfamily,' friends and colleagues. It felt very cathartic, a bit of release during a difficult\nweek.\nI have fallen behind in responding to emails this week - did not feel up to it or was\ndistracted by procedures and doctors' visits. Hope to respond as soon as I'm able.\nSincere thanks to friends, family and colleagues who took the time to write. Hopefully\nyou'll next hear from me in State College. I am bummed to be missing the ovarian\ncancer survivorship conference here on Saturday, but it's logistically tricky for me to stay\nhere for that -- and I'm eager to get home.",

While I'm sincerely\ngrateful for the care I received at Hopkins, and while it was hugs all around with Kendall,\nLynne and some of the other wonderful nurses in Weinberg 4B when I left yesterday (see\npic), the hospital stays are wearing emotionally and psychologically. They are, simply,\nhard. The ride back to State College took much longer than usual, due to a combination\nof Friday rush hour traffic, construction and what seemed to be some traffic in advance\nof the PSU-Pitt game today.\nI went to bed around 11 p.m.and slept until 11:15 a.m! Such a relief not to be woken\nthroughout the night to have vitals taken, medicines changed in the drip, and to talk to\nthe doctors on their rounds (usually at 6 a.m.). While the game was going on this\nafternoon, I took advantage of the quiet in town and drove to Wegman's, where I bought\nthe 'fixings' to make chicken soup with matzah balls, to get a start on my Rosh Hashanah\ncooking. Nothing screams 'home,' 'comfort,' and 'zen' to me more than chicken soup, so\nI'm going to dump the chicken, carrots, celery, leeks, parsnips, onion, turnips, parsley,\ngarlic, ginger, peppercorns, cloves, salt etc. in a big pot tomorrow and let it simmer\nthroughout the day. I'll likely reserve a bowl for myself and save the rest for the holiday.\nYum.\nI will definitely be needing some extra measures of Patience and Fortitude (incidentally,\nthe names of the two lions at the entrance to the New York Public Library) to deal with all\nthe meds I will be administering to myself for the next ten weeks: I flush and drain my\nstomach tube twice a day (it's currently hurting me at the insertion site but I hope that\nwill abate), then change the gauze dressing, and administer two different antibiotics\nthrough an IV drip, using a different system than the one I used before. Am also taking\neight potassium pills a day, in addition to other medications. I can think of a million other\nthings I'd rather be doing and hope that this is not all screaming 'invalid.' Need to keep\nmy spirit strong and focus on my core vitality. All this laboriousness will be worth it,\nthough, if it gets me through the final three rounds of chemo. Fingers firmly crossed.\nIf all goes as planned, my next trip to Hopkins is scheduled for Oct. 22. I always welcome\nrides there, to relieve some of my dependence on the car service I've been using as I\ndon't feel up to making that longish drive myself. Please let me know if you know anyone\nwho might help with this.\nThank you for your comments on my posts. They are all meaningful and encouraging to\nme, and I'm sorry I'm unable to respond to each one.\nWhile I was in the hospital the leaves started changing color and falling. I can't wait to\ntake walks and drives on these mellow days. Fall is my favorite season.\nXXOO \n  \n                       172 / 1.901",

In the case of treatment\nand healing, i believe it\u2019s the destination, not the journey\u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, September 14, 2019  \nSo happy to hear you\u2019re home and resting up \u2014your soup sounds delicious!

And I hear you, it was with complete surprise and fear\nthat I answered to my doctors \"Wait, what?! I will be the one administering my three\ndaily injections and milk/clean/measure my drains?!\" when they told me I will be doing\nthe care at home.... especially coming from a place like France where they send nurses\nto your home to do all this for the patient. Here, we literally have an active hand into our\nhealing process!\nWilla, you are a fighter and such a source of inspiration for others, you are already up\nand back at it, driving and cooking what sounds like a delicious soup! You are amazing!\n  \u2014Sophia Fortune, September 15, 2019  \nDear Willa,\nI need to go out to get some chicken and vegetables, \"l'eau me vient \u00e0 la bouche\". I\nmade some chicken soup and Matzo balls just a few days ago - Gabe loves it, I do to -\nand by now I have mastered making the Matzo balls! The first time I made some - long\nago in Albuquerque - they ended up being very hard! Not because of the altitude and the\ndifference is makes in cooking, but because I kept adding Matzo meal in order to be able\nto make little balls! I have learned, and without patting myself in the back, I think that\nmy chicken soup is good, but I have to try to make it with all the vegetables you mention\nsince I usually put in only celery, onion, and carrots. I will let you know how it turns out.\nYes, I am sure it is good to be back home in your own bed without having to be awaken\nevery few hours. Hospital are not for sick people! Lucky us we are doing fine. I had a\n                       173 / 1.901\ncataract operation, first the right eye, then two weeks later, the left. All went well, colors\nare brighter, and I can see better. The weather here has been rather cool for the season\nand rainy, but as of today the temperature went back to the 80s, so summer is back\nagain for a few days. By the way Gabe has received a very good article for the JOJ on\nMme Desoye from someone who teaching at Montclaire College. She has found a lot of\ninformation on this mysterious lady. Will send you the article when it is in final form or\npublished.\nFrom what you are writing, I gather that you are taking care of most of your medical\nproblems yourself, wouldn't it be easier, kinder to yourself if a nurse came to do it for\nyou? Or is this a way to keep more in control of your care. You are so courageous, few\npeople are so strong. Are some of your students and colleagues helping? I hope so. We\nare thinking of you, hoping that you do not loose your spirit and hope. Love. Yvonne and\nGabe\n  \u2014gabriel weisberg, September 15, 2019  \nSending loving and healing thoughts your way dear, strong, amazing Willa!!\n  \u2014Paula Golombek, September 15, 2019  \n  \nSeptember 17, 2019 - Normalcy",

    "entry": "As challenging as it is adjusting to a hospital stay, returning home can be difficult too.\nThe rhythms, schedules, faces and spaces are so radically different. I tried to preserve\nsome sense of 'normalcy' in the hospital this time by wearing my own clothes (as\nopposed to a gown), including sleeping in my own p.j.s. And I've attempted to get back\nto normal since I've been back by repeating familiar gestures -- making chicken soup,\ngrocery shopping, taking walks in the beautiful weather and reading by Spring Creek.\nIt's been quiet here since I've been back. I have to spend an inordinate amount of time\nflushing, draining, administering antibiotics, changing dressings, and taking medication.\nIt's frustrating and boring, but if this is what is needed to enable me to claw my way over\nthe finish line with chemo in early November, I'm in for sure. I'm already nervous that\nthe fistula (hole) between my bowel and my stomach that was detected in my last CT\nscan might get bigger and result in sepsis, which would of course be dire (on the other\nhand, the hole is microscopic and may heal on its own; the doctors will attend to it once\n                       174 / 1.901\nchemo is done). And I think the doctors may have decided not to give me another chemo\ndrug that might help me, Avastin, because of the stomach infection issues. So I really\nhave to hope and pray for the best result over the next ten weeks or so, and must\nbelieve that my treatment is not being compromised in any significant way.\nIn more encouraging news, I actually feel better! The impetus for this last hospitalization\nwas my stomach feeling out of whack - I hardly had any appetite, and it felt as if my food\nwas not being digested properly -- perhaps a result of the abscess. The past few days\nI've had what might pass as a hearty appetite, and I can taste my food! At lunch today at\nthe Ale House with my friend Kathryn, I consumed my Thai chicken salad with gusto and\ntreated myself to a mid-afternoon ice cream cone yesterday. I'll take it.\nI'm trying to arrange lunches, coffees, and other outings with friends but feel a bit\nisolated. People are working, busy with school - it's understandable. I'm generally ok with\nalone time and also have some small projects to work on. But sometimes the silence is a\nbit much for my fundamentally extroverted self. Happily, my mother and son will be\ncoming to State College for Rosh Hashanah next week, which I look forward to spending\nwith them, my congregation and other friends. Such a hopeful holiday, with its message\nof renewal.\nFinally, a very dear friend whom I've known since grade school has offered to drive me to\nmy next appointment at Hopkins! She lives in CA but may be coming here from NY. We\nare working out the details but I am so touched by this act of friendship. Of my grade\nschool friends (32 of us graduated together from our Grade 1-12 school), at least five if\nnot more are following my page and showing extraordinary love and solidarity dating\nback to when some of us were...six years old!",

    "entry": "Thankfully, my stomach abscess seems to have been held in check this week between\nthe IV antibiotics and the drain. Consequently, I've had no stomach pain and I do have an\nappetite (which will undoubtedly disappear for a few days after chemo this Monday).\nAll this made for a comparatively 'normal' week, for which I'm immensely grateful, as I\nam for the beautiful mellow end of summer weather. I pushed myself to walk a good two-\nmile loop in a nearby park and will try to build on that (because I still don't have a huge\namount of stamina, I usually have to rest for a while after such an exertion, which of\ncourse would not have winded me at all pre-cancer). I returned to my book group after\nabout a four-month hiatus due to my health situation: smart, interesting women, wine\n(none for me, alas) and cheese in abundance; and a spirited discussion of Tara\nWestover's _Educated._ I spent a good 5-6 hours on campus yesterday, first meeting\nwith a graduate student whose dissertation I direct; then attending the dissertation\ndefense of a student with whom I've worked closely over the years and of whom I'm very\nfond; and finally attending the post-defense reception. It felt great to be back 'in the mix'\ntemporarily, within the cocoon of our wonderfully supportive and intellectually sharp\ndepartment. Several students and colleagues told me how much I am missed, which was\ntouching. I spend likely too much time these days torn between worrying if I'll be ready\n                       176 / 1.901\nto tackle the demands of my job in January (right now, my body needs *a lot* of sleep)\nand very much missing my professional life and the people who make it so rewarding.\nOne day at a time. I was also able to do a large shop at Wegman's for Rosh Hashanah\ndishes I hope to make in the next few days (honey cake, kugel, matzah balls) and then\nI'll do a second shop this week for the rest (brisket, tsimmes, chopped liver, a compote of\nsome kind).\nMy friend Katarina and I enjoyed a coffee on the porch of Cafe Lemont, in the sun. Her\nparents live in Israel and are visiting now. They kindly brought me a beautiful hamsa to\nbe hung on the wall inscribed with a prayer for healing (including a prayer for\n*caregivers,* who are often also in need of healing). They took the hamsa to the kotel\n(Western Wall) and said a prayer over it there. They also brought me a very delicate\nhamsa pendant, with silver filigree. So very thoughtful.\nI am praying that my chemo infusion goes well on Monday. Specifically, I dread a repeat\nof last time, when the chemo either triggered or aggravated a stomach abscess. I am\npraying that this time I am 'covered,' but I don't think having chemo while being treated\nfor an infection is ideal. I want to be well for the holiday, and hope that I'll be feeling\nbetter by Friday. Please send good thoughts my way. I will have a visitor (or two or\nthree) to keep me company at least part of the time and will try to stay calm.",

    "entry": "Four down, two to go! Everything went smoothly this morning. My kind neighbor Janis\ndrove me to (and from) the Geisinger facility where I receive chemo (a convenient ten-\nminute drive from my house). I had blood drawn, vitals taken, and then met with Dr.\nPatel, my oncologist. My blood work looked fine, thankfully. He confirmed that I will not\nbe given Avastin because it might aggravate/cause a fistula, like the one I have now,\nwhich will need to be attended to after my treatment is finished. He said it was fairly\nuncommon for patients to receive chemo while also attending to an infection such as\nmine, but I simply have to be hopeful that I can get through these final three treatments\nwithout a setback.\n                       179 / 1.901\nAs I've mentioned before, the likelihood of a recurrence with ovarian cancer is quite high,\nso I may not be done with chemo (nor surgery) after these six rounds are over. A\nrecurrence could happen after several months, a year, two years, or in a minority of\ncases, never. At the risk of sounding like a broken record: one day at a time.\nI was infused from about 9:00 to 2:30. It is pretty straightforward. No raving Trump\nsupporters this time, although the place was full. I wish it had windows. Around noon, a\nnew friend, Jackie (one of the \"III Cs\" I've recently met) came to visit, bearing the now\ntraditional vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy (delicious). Jackie (who is Scottish) is\ndelightful, interesting, active, youthful (at 73) and very kind. Her visit, and her long-term\nsurvival, were both very cheering. Otherwise, I was engrossed in an excellent book I'm\nreading for next month's book group, _Where the Crawdads Sing._ The drip doesn't hurt,\nthe nurses are solicitous and skillful, and once I get into a zone, the time passes fairly\nquickly. Like much else on this journey, what initially seemed daunting or frightening has\nnow been normalized to some extent.\nI got home around 3:00, took a nap, then made a big lokshen (noodle) kugel for Sunday's\nholiday meal - sweet foods for a sweet new year. Cooking will continue throughout the\nweek, in between the home treatments, reading, working on some small projects,\nemails, walks etc. Anticipating a brutal W-TH post-chemo crash, but hopefully not as bad\nas last time.\nThank you for all the support and well wishes.

    "entry": "Today is the birthday of the world, Jewish tradition teaches, a time of renewal and hope\nfor the year ahead. We've fully entered the month of elul, which coincides with early\nautumn, and the \"Days of Awe:\" Rosh Hashanah, on which our fate for the new year is\nwritten, and Yom Kippur, on which it is is sealed. Our lives are depicted as being in the\nbalance during these days before the 'gates close:' \"who shall live to a ripe old age and\nwho shall lie dying on a bed of pain?\" It's an existential state; we're truly 'on the narrow\nbridge.' We beat our chests as we catalog the sins that we've been guilty of the past\nyear. Yet we are told that teshuvah (repentence or return), tefillah (prayer) and tzedakah\n(charity) can temper the harshness of God's decree.\nHaving had to confront my own mortality over the past few months, the spiritual side of\nmy journey has come into fuller relief, including during the holidays. I'll welcome the\nopportunity at dinner tonight, while blessing a round challah, symbol of the cycle of life,\nand later at services, to tap into feelings of hopefulness, renewal, and immanence. To\n                       183 / 1.901\nEmily Dickinson, hope is \"the thing with feathers-/That perches in the soul-\" that can be\nheard in \"the chillest land-/And on the strangest Sea-\" I've indeed felt glimmers of hope\nin the 'chillest land' and 'strangest Sea' where I've found myself struggling over the past\nfew months. As for my fate, it surely lies somewhere at the intersection of the designs of\nsome nasty, aggressive, microscopic cancer cells, the skills of my medical team, and my\nown fighting spirit. \nI am spiritual, yet agnostic. I apologize if this offends any believers who may be reading\nthis. But I do firmly believe in the manifestation of 'godly' qualities in people, animals,\nand nature, whether it be loving kindness, graciousness, mercifulness, or compassion. I\nhave seen these attributes displayed time and time again since my diagnosis, whether\nthrough friends coming to spend time with me, text or call me, send me thoughtful gifts,\nvolunteer to do errands for me, cook for me, drive me to Baltimore, or just 'hold space'\nfor me. It is quite wondrous. \nIt is a wonderful holiday this year because my mother and Ben are here. My mother and I\nhave been cooking up a storm; I'm not quite sure how I managed to pull it off as at the\nbeginning of the week I was completely wiped out from chemo, but I was searing brisket\nand frying onions in pomegranate molasses early this morning. I was hoping that Ben\nmight take some interest in the holiday cooking (he certainly does in the eating), as I'm\nnot sure who will continue the culinary traditions after my mother and me. \nMitchel and Paula, I will be in touch w/you soon.

    "entry": "186 / 1.901\n                       187 / 1.901\nGray skies and chilly temps today presage fall, not the autumn of \"mellow fruitfulness\" but the\n\"season of mists\" that can tend to make me feel gloomy and isolated. I turned the heat on for the first\ntime. I also slept a good part of the day, which always annoys me as I feel that I should be up and\nabout, being productive. I suppose I need to 'listen to my body.' My stomach has also been feeling a\nbit 'cranky' and achy the past few days, although it often doesn't feel quite right. Always hard to know\nif it's 'something' or 'nothing.' Because of my recent history of stomach abscesses, the last one\nnecessitating an unexpected week-long hospitalization, I tend to project a lot of anxiety onto my body,\nand am now also fully aware of the perils of *late* detection. On the other hand, if I ignore whatever\nseems to be a bit 'off' with my stomach, I will be assured of receiving chemo on the 14th, which is the\nultimate goal. So it's an abundance of caution v. potentially magical thinking. I am inclined to write to\nmy medical team tomorrow to let them know about the symptoms and see if they'd like me to have a\nscan done here next week (I will definitely be having a scan between rounds 5 and 6).\nI may be tired because of all the activity around the holiday, which nevertheless was lovely. It was\ncomforting having my mother and Ben here, and we enjoyed dipping apple slices in honey and\nobserving other holiday rituals. I sauteed fresh spinach from Tait Farm in delicious olive oil from\nsouthern France that came to me in a stupendous 'goodie box' from my dear college friend Mitchel,\nfull of both culinary products (honey, chocolate, tapenade, olives) and perfumed items from\nFragonard, all from around Nice, where he's lived for many years. I am not used to being pampered\nthis way, and I was very touched! I managed to pull off a big multicourse meal, as I love to do, but by\nthe end I was really tired and my mother and Ben had to help serve/clean up. Michael and Sue had a\nparty after services on Monday, where I was able to catch up with some other friends over bagels and\nlox. That gathering bumped up right against the tashlich service, and so I didn't make it there this\nyear.\nMany friends and acquaintances whom I saw at services extended wishes for my return to good\nhealth - kind of them. Despite what I wrote in my last post, I too was praying pretty hard to be\ninscribed for a healthy and peaceful year (w/that prayer extended to all my family and friends).\nThings continue to be pretty....quiet. I did attend a lecture on campus by the political commentator\nAndrew Sullivan (whom I've been reading since his _New Republic_ days), on \"Democracy in the Age\nof Trump.\" Fascinating lecture with a grim message (basically: we're screwed). Also read another\nbook I greatly enjoyed, _Where the Crawdads Sing_ by Delia Owens. Happily, I have a book party to\nattend tomorrow and a few get-togethers with friends planned (and welcome even more), but my\nvoracious social (and physical) energy are definitely down a few notches right now. Hopefully, they'll\nbe back before too long.\nPhotos\n                       188 / 1.901\n                       189 / 1.901\n                       190 / 1.901\n                       191 / 1.901\n                       192 / 1.901\n                       193 / 1.901\n                       194 / 1.901\n                       195 / 1.901",

    "entry": "In another strange twist on 'nothing is predictable anymore,' I had an active day on\nSaturday -- farmers' market, shopping at Wegmans, scenic drive to Brush Valley, with its\nbig swaths of farmland, produce stands and Amish buggies, soup making (veggie this\nweek: green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, leeks, carrots, corn). I was so tired (or out of\nsorts?) on Sunday, though, that I slept most of the day, which is very disorienting.\nCold, rainy weather set in on Sunday and Monday, which, in addition to darkness arriving\nearlier each day, contributed to my gloomy spirits and feelings of isolation. I found\nmyself venturing to morbid places I try hard not to enter -- wondering whether cancer is\ntrying to make quick business out of me, pondering the particular aggressiveness of my\nform of the disease (which Dr. Beavis tried to explain to me very clearly but which I'm\n                       197 / 1.901\nstill not sure I absorbed entirely), wondering what might be going on in my body right\nnow to cause me some stomach discomfort and questioning whether additional imaging\nshould be done before my next chemo on Monday. On that note, I am going to see Dr.\nPatel tomorrow so he can examine me and determine whether imaging is desirable (on\nthe upside, my appetite is healthy and I have no fever). There are days when I definitely\nneed a few extra measures of grace to handle my health challenge.\nSpending time with friends/acquaintances helped get me out of my funk. A very nice\nacquaintance from synagogue, Deena, picked me up for a \"life is short, eat dessert first\"\ndate at the Creamery, where half a tuna sandwich each was just an excuse for the\ngigantic ice cream cones each of us indulged in after that. This morning Gay and I had\none of our ritual breakfasts at the Waffle Shop (mini-platter for me...); I reveled in the\n'normalcy' of such a get-together. Friends and family are usually my lifeline in glum\nmoments, so I very much appreciated these get-togethers (plus other texts and emails\nthis week).\nI'll go to Kol Nidre tonight and services tomorrow (for most of the day). Although I usually\nfast on Yom Kippur, I will have to forego that this year. My doctor thinks there is too\nmuch risk of dehydration, which would put strain on my kidneys and imperil my chemo\ntreatment. I wish I had more control over whether I'll be *sealed* in the Book of Life for\nanother year but only part of the outcome is in my hands, in the form of self-care,\nattitude, being proactive with my treatment etc. I'm not sure how this realization makes\nme feel. Wishing everyone who observes an easy fast and a good \"sealing\" for a year of\nhealth, happiness and peace.",

    "entry": "200 / 1.901\n                       201 / 1.901\nAs I was walking to Yom Kippur services Wednesday on a brilliantly sunny autumn\nmorning, the sun highlighting all the beautiful leaf tones of green, yellow, gold and red, I\nsaid to myself: \"Next year on Yom Kippur morning I want to be doing exactly the same\nthing I'm doing today.\" I suppose that passes as my prayer to be inscribed in the Book of\nLife for another year.\nI found an interesting meditation on the Reform Judaism website for 'one who cannot\nfast.' Apparently, Judaism proscribes fasting for those under thirteen, pregnant women,\nand those who are ill. My oncologist was wary of my fasting, as I most always do on YK,\nbecause I need the hydration. So instead of fasting I reflected on this excerpt from a\nlonger meditation:\nYou know, dear God, that it is not my intent\nto be apart from our people and our tradition.\nMy current state of health makes it unsuitable for me to fast\nSo, dear God, I turn to You now in sincerity and openness:\nHelp me in the coming year to do my best in guarding my health.\nHelp us, Your children, learn how to protect our bodies from harm.\nHelp us support others in caring for their , their Image of God.\nTeach us to help one another grow and thrive in Body, Mind, and Spirit.\nGuide caring family and health care professionals in their partnering with you\nto bring healing if not cure, support and strength if not an end to symptoms.\nAnd if there is an opportunity for me to help others who suffer\nby doing something they need or by being attentive company \u2014\nGrant me the ability to do this mitzvah with love and devotion. \nThe spirit of compassion, community and connection seemed to move several members of my\ncongregation to reach out to me, very kindly, with renewed offers of rides, meals, errands etc. I\nwas quite touched. I also received two spontaneous chicken soup deliveries! I am well-stocked\nwith soup to get me through Monday's chemo and its aftermath.\nDuring a break in services I ran over to my oncologist's office to get his take on whether he felt\nI might be 'brewing' another stomach abscess. He pressed on some tender areas near the\ndrain insertion point but felt that it was minor inflammation and nothing to be concerned about.\nWhereas Dr. Mehta (infectious disease specialist) at Hopkins felt that I should definitely have a\nCT scan, Dr. Patel (oncologist) seemed confident that chemo could proceed on Monday. Who\nis right?? I noted that in today's blood work my red blood count is rather low, and I hope that\nthat -- or anything else -- does not interfere with chemo. I am anxious. I'll have at least one\nfriend, Jackie (one of the 'III Cs'), visit with me for a little while. I'm prepared for a wretched\n                       202 / 1.901\ncouple of days post-chemo but maybe I'll be surprised.\nAs a friend pointed out in passing recently, I inhabit a strange space between 'normalcy' (or\nsome semblance of it) and its complete opposite. I am grateful for the 'normalcy' of a lovely\nlunch with my friend Kathryn; morning coffee with my friend Clare; dinner and catch-up with my\nfriend Maria; and a good chat with my friend Helen while basking in the late afternoon sun in\nthe arboretum, decorated with gorgeous seasonal displays of gourds and pumpkins. Far less\nnormal, or rather the 'new normal,' are two hours' worth of infusions per day, twice daily\ndrainings of my stomach abscess, nurse visits to change my port, and managing peoples'\nreactions to my cancer news. It's sometimes hard to navigate life in these 'two worlds...'\nPlease keep your fingers crossed for an unproblematic chemo infusion for me on Monday and\nfor a not too awful aftermath.",

    "entry": "My infusion went smoothly today. Happily, my blood counts were in the normal-ish\nrange. My liver function was a bit elevated but Dr. Patel said that it's because it's\nworking 'overtime' now to process the various drugs in my system.\nI was at Dr. Patel's office from 8:15 to 2:15 and even dozed a bit this time, wrapped up in\na blanket, as I didn't sleep much last night and was also given Benadryl before the\nchemo drugs. No ranters this time, thankfully, but rather several skilled, calm and\nsolicitous nurses. Four angels (in addition to the nurses) brightened my day. My friend\nGay picked me up at home bright and early (dropping off some homemade chili and also \npumpkin pie for the Canadian Thanksgiving she's observing today), and stayed with me\nfor the first hour of my infusion. At around eleven, Jackie -- one of the \"III Cs\" and a lovely\nperson -- stopped by with the now traditional vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy. A mild\ncold prevented her from staying with me as planned, but she blew me a big kiss.\nSometime in the early afternoon (I was snoozing), Rhonda, my mentor from the Hopkins\nWoman to Woman program who lives in nearby Lewistown, stopped by to visit briefly.\nWe had a great talk about how to stay positive and keep going despite all the\nuncertainty and legitimate reason for sadness and depression (which it is also important\nto acknowledge, but not wallow in). That talk did me a lot of good. Finally, when I was\ndone my kind next-door neighbor Janis was waiting outside to take me home. We talked\nabout her losing a five-year-old son to cancer -- something I had not known --and how\nshe managed to get through that. She was gracious to confide in me that way. I was\ntired on my return so I rested for a while. Sorry to have missed the glorious weather\ntoday but I may be able to catch more of it tomorrow. Thanks so much to friends and\nfamily who sent texts and emails today- I'm feeling the love!\nMy last chemo infusion in this series is on Nov. 4th. It is unclear what will happen after\n                       204 / 1.901\nthat. I will need to have the fistula repaired at Hopkins. Much will depend on the result of\nthe scan I will have on October 22nd, also at Hopkins. This will reveal a lot about how\nsuccessful the treatment has been. In this context, I have mentioned the CA125 marker,\nan ovarian tumor marker that is normally supposed to go down as treatment continues.\nIn July, after surgery, my marker was 164.5, which is considered high. For the next three\ntreatments, to my surprise and even annoyance, Dr. Patel did not request that the\nCA125 marker be included in my blood work, so *there is no data for those three\ntreatments.* As mentioned in an earlier post, he does not want me to get fixated on the\nnumber, as the scan is the most revelatory indicator of progress and as, as he said to\nme, \"I still need to treat you no matter what.\" I still think, though, as a patient it is my\nright to know this information. But now I won't. Oh well. \nToday's CA125 number is 57.4. It's dropped a good deal but is still listed as high. The\nnormal range is considered 1-30 (I note that in August 2017, way before I was ever\ndiagnosed with cancer, my number was 4.6). So the good news is that the number has\ndropped significantly (Dr. Patel seemed to think so), and perhaps will drop even more\nnext time. But as predicted, the fact that it's still considered a bit high is causing me\nanxiety in terms of what follow-up treatment I will need (More chemo? Parp inhibitors?\nMore surgery? None of the above)? I will know more after I have my scan and discuss\nwith Dr. Beavis. So for now, one day at a time. The whole world is a narrow bridge, but\nthe most important thing is not to give in to despair. These mantras still work for me.\nDaydreaming about a little getaway with pals to mark the end of this round of chemo,\nprobably in my neck of the woods, and have a discussed with a friend or two.\nSuggestions?

This morning, the visiting nurse who came to deaccess my port\nthought the discharge from my drainage site looked disconcerting and advised I go to\nthe ER. I had also discussed this possibility, by phone, the night before with an infectious\ndiseases doctor filling in for Dr. Mehta. So I headed to the ER around 1:30, knowing that\nI\u2019d likely be stuck there for hours. To make a llloong story short (partly because I\u2019m\ntyping on my iPhone), I had bloodwork and cultures done (sepsis is always a worry...),\nfollowed by a CT scan. Then the ER doctor here, who seemed quite competent, conferred\nby phone with the infectious diseases doctor at Hopkins. They decided that they should\nkeep me here in the hospital for a night or two to make sure nothing untoward happens\nwith the infection. My heart rate was also high when I got to the hospital and my blood\npressure was low; I didn\u2019t feel great.\nSo here I am. I\u2019m praying I can go home tomorrow. I\u2019m a bit weepy but am just trying to\nget through this short-term situation. And probably best to err on the side of caution.\nWhile the standard of care seems adequate here, and the staff has been kind, it can\u2019t\ncompare to the world-class care I receive at Hopkins. Also, nary a brown or black face\nhere; welcome to central PA...\nIt\u2019s been one of those days when I hope I\u2019m not becoming my disease, a mass of\nunpleasantness.

    "entry": "214 / 1.901\n                       215 / 1.901\nPerhaps my 'reward' for last weekend's depressing hospital stay was a wonderful,\nuplifting visit from my high school friend, Jill, who arrived on Monday afternoon and left\nWednesday morning. Jill lives in Calabasas, CA but is often on the east coast visiting her\ndaughters in NY and Princeton, NJ. When she learned that I had to go to Hopkins on the\n22nd, she offered to drive out here from Princeton, spend the night at my home and then\ndrive me to Baltimore and back! As it turns out, though, my appointment yesterday at\nHopkins wound up being rescheduled until Nov. 19th. Dr. Beavis felt that since I had just\nbeen hospitalized and am feeling better from having had a blood transfusion, and since\ntwo CT scans here in State College revealed that my stomach drain is still correctly\nplaced and functioning fine, we could forego this appointment, which was going to be a\nconsultation with no procedures involved. On Nov. 19th, I will have a post-chemo scan to\nsee whether there is still evidence of disease (fingers crossed). We'll also talk about the\nrest of the treatment plan going forward, including repairing the fistula if it has not\nclosed on its own.\nSo our girls' road trip to Balto turned into a relaxing catch up visit here in State College. I\nlast saw Jill about 2-3 years ago (?) at a memorial event for one of our classmates. As our\ngraduating class consisted of *23* young women, most of us are still in touch (in fact,\nmore and more so as the years pass and thanks to social media; I know that several are\nkind enough to follow this journal). Jill was one of my closest friends in high school,\nhaving arrived at Nightingale-Bamford (our school) in 9th grade, unlike most of us who\nhad entered in first or, in my case, second grade. Jill and I remained in touch over the\nyears via birthday cards and Facebook, but have only really reconnected in person in the\npast few years.\nA (Jewish) New Yorker after my own heart, Jill came bearing 'the good stuff' from the city:\na large container of chicken soup from the 2nd Avenue Deli (accompanied by two large,\nfluffy, schmaltzy matzah balls), walnut pumpernickel from Orwasher's bakery -- like a\nProustian madeleine for me, as one bite sent me back to my grandmother's townhouse\non E. 94th street where, when I visited her after school, we'd eat Orwasher's raisin\npumpernickel slathered in butter, accompanied by...Kahlua!; and a box of delicious\ncookies (palmiers, hamentashen, black and white, macaroons), also from Orwasher's.\nThere was no end to the catching up and reminiscing (we tried to recreate in detail the\napartments of each of our classmates, while recalling the quirks of their parents and\nsiblings), with plenty of time to take stock of the present (aging parents, twenty-\nsomething children, insurance plans). With great sensitivity, Jill gave me plenty of space\nto talk about my cancer if I felt like it; it turned out that I didn't feel I needed a lot of\nroom to do so, beyond acknowledging the challenge of balancing a tough diagnosis and\ntreatment with a strong will to live my life, the best one possible. It poured all day\nyesterday, but between the raindrops we managed to sneak out for a coffee/tea at Cafe\n                       216 / 1.901\nLemont and a quick trip to the farmers' market, followed by a rainy drive around town\nand campus (complete with the requisite photo-op by the Nittany Lion shrine) and dinner\nat Barrel 21.\nI had been telling my therapist the other day that I don't laugh very much these days\n(kinda sad to think that, but it turns out that cancer isn't that hilarious after all), so I very\nmuch appreciated all the smiles and laughter Jill's visit elicited, in addition to her\n'positivity' (for lack of a better term) around my illness (stressing how well I looked and\nstrong I seemed, etc.) . It was all therapeutic, and I've been feeling pretty well the past\nfew days (with an appetite, too).\nAfter Jill left, I got back into bed and slept a bit longer (still need a lot of sleep...), then\ntook a drive out a pretty country road to admire the foliage on this beautiful sunny day.\nThe leaves looked like golden glitter with the sun streaming through them. No buggies\ntoday, but a laid-back general store in Spring Mills, PA, and lots of pick-up trucks.\nGrateful for the balm of friendship. \nPhotos\n                       217 / 1.901\n                       218 / 1.901",

    "entry": "221 / 1.901\n                       222 / 1.901\nThere is not too much to report. I am generally feeling well. The further removed I am\nfrom chemo, the better I feel. But the closer I get to the next round of chemo, the more\nanxious I become. So I'm sort of on that cusp right now. I feel relieved that Monday will\nbe my last round of chemo, perhaps warranting a small celebration of sorts. But I feel\nuneasy anticipating the scan I'll have at Hopkins on 11/19, which will reveal if the\ntreatment's been effective and I've gone into remission. Nothing on this journey is\nstraightforward. Sigh.\nMy thoughtful sis-in-law, Ronit, texted me the other day to say she was thinking of me\nand to wish me well (much appreciated). She wrote that she hoped I was enjoying some\n'easy pleasures,' despite the dreariness of my medical situation. This seemed not only a\nkind wish but good advice too. I've been trying to milk a lot of enjoyment out of easy\npleasures, ones that are within my control (it turns out there are many), including coffee\nat our local second hand bookshop/coffee shop w/my friend Clare; farmers market with\nmy friend Maria and her son (and my former student) Anthony; a delicious dinner\nmarking Diwali at a local Indian restaurant, with lots of special dishes, also with Maria; a\nnice visit from my friend Helen, w/whom I have a lunch date tomorrow at a local hole in\nthe wall Mexican place that serves great food! It is true that my 'easy pleasures' often\ninvolve friends and food (and right now my appetite seems to be back with a\nvengeance). I also enjoyed a long walk in the mellow sun today; my favorite ginkgo trees\nhave turned yellow, others are brilliant red...\nI had a strange dream in which I was drunk on champagne. I was drinking unfinished half-\nglasses in some sort of hotel or banquet hall, dressed in a ball gown [?], waiting for a\nparty to start [?]. Meanwhile, in reality I've had about a half a glass of wine since May!\nThen, I began walking through the public spaces in the hotel singing loudly with abandon\nto anyone who would listen the first verse of \"Tracks of my Tears\" by Smokey Robinson\nand the Miracles: \"People say I'm the life of the party/Cause I tell a joke or two/You know\nI'm not really laughing loud and hearty/Deep inside I'm blue/So take a good look at my\nface/You know my smile seems out of place/If you look closer it's easy to trace/The\ntracks of my tears.\" Somehow this resonated with an image I saw on an ovarian cancer\nsupport group page today (see pic). I don't normally feel this 'blue' 'deep inside' (or\nrather, that feeling has abated since May as I have settled into the 'new normal' and\nhave proved myself pretty resilient) but perhaps the song and image tapped into a once\nin a while feeling, or one that's buried away from my everyday consciousness.\nMy rabbi was in another dream, in a protective, nurturing (of me) role. He was sort of a\ncaretaker. The same dream also featured, I believe, Ben and another boy as little boys,\nwith me in the caretaker role. That's all I remember.\nMy friend Mary made me some delicious soup with chick peas, garlic, Parmesan cheese\n                       223 / 1.901\nand I can't tell what else and I look forward to enjoying it for dinner. I bought fixings for\ncarrot soup (w/miso and ginger) at the farmers market. Maybe a project for tomorrow.",
    "comments": "I was just thinking of you during my daily walk this morning. I am happy to read that you\nare delving into the \"easy pleasures,\" as you call them, that cannot be taken for granted\nand that were so easily overlooked in our pre-cancer life. Now, with a new perspective,\nthe little things shared with family and friends are everything! Also, this chick pea soup\nsounds amazing with garlic and Parmesan cheese! Glad that you still have your appetite.\nBises, XO\n  \u2014Sophia Fortune, October 28, 2019  \nWilla, honey: Your \"new normal\" has found you remarkably resilient indeed! I will be\nthinking loving,positive thoughts about you next Monday (and up through then and\nalways!) and sending out special prayers around the Nov. 19 appointment. Meanwhile,\nso very, very glad to hear you're feeling better and are able to enjoy no shortage of\nfresh, yummy foods, many of them prepared with love by your bountiful network of\ncaring friends. Here's to a return to a strong, healthy normal sooner than later and\ngetting to do whatever you desire. xxxxxxoooooo\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, October 28, 2019  \nRevived appetite sounds like an excellent sign! I noticed the ginkgo leaves, too. Ginkgo\ncertainly provides an example of a flourishing survivor, too!\n  \u2014Christopher Walker, October 28, 2019  \nWilla, what a lovely journal entry. You describe so beautifully the moments you enjoy.\nAnd you have the most poetic dreams. You really took me into another world. I am with\nAndrew Sellon tonight Cool will reach out to you soon. He will be performing in Edwin\nDrood in Florida soon, but he had time to see a play reading of something Mike wrote. He\nis a dear friend.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, October 28, 2019  \nI am happy that so many of what you call your small pleasures involve enjoying food. It\nis my humble belief that a good appetite goes along with good, or improving, health. So I\nfeel very positive about your progress.\nKeep on telling us all about the healthful, yummy foods you are enjoying. It's almost like\n                       224 / 1.901\nreading a gourmet column.\nLove,\nAunt Marlene\n  \u2014Marlene Green, October 28, 2019  \nCongratulations on milking a lot of enjoyment out of easy pleasures! Your paragraph\nwonderfully describes your pleasure, ending on a kind of long note we studied in class. I\ntoo love ginkgo trees, particularly the one in front of the Helen Eakin Eisenhower Chapel.\nYou continue to be in our thoughts and prayers. Hopefully, your bountiful network of\ncaring friends, as Julie writes, will be ever- present with exuberant, contagious hope and\nunderstanding. Bien amicalement, Marianne\n  \u2014Marian Freed, October 28, 2019  \nWhen your entry starts \"not too much to report,\" that is probably a good sign. We will be\nmissing you at NCFS this week. I hope next year you can come and finish off people's\nhalf-consumed champagne glasses at the banquet while wearing your ball gown.\n  \u2014Richard Shryock, October 29, 2019  \nSo glad your appetite is back! I love this notion of easy pleasures, Willa. A wonderful\nwisdom here -- for us all. Sending you love and strength. xoxS\n  \u2014Sally Charnow, October 29, 2019  \nNot too much to report means less \"reporting\" of the medical treatment you've been\ngoing through and more \"reporting\" of your emotional experiencing. I know people can\nbe quick to say you look great, coming out of an intention of kindness, and how\nconversely invalidating this can feel. This site always seems like a space for you to\nreveal more of what you're experiencing, and your eloquence makes this an unusual\nexperience for a reader. I'll leave it at that.... But may you continue to enjoy these easy\npleasures dear Willa.\n  \u2014Paula Golombek, October 30, 2019  \n  \nOctober 31, 2019 - The Best Rx (bis)\n                       225 / 1.901",

    "entry": "I just returned from getting a flu shot and the first of two pneumonia shots. My PCP\n(Primary Care Provider), Dr. Damaske, wrote me and encouraged me to get both to make\nsure to protect my immune system through the winter. While the nurse was giving me\nthe shots in an examination room, Dr. Damaske stopped by to say hello. We really had\nnot been in contact since my initial diagnosis in April, as he's taken the back seat to the\nHopkins team and Dr. Patel in State College. Yet he's been a caring, concerned,\nsympathetic presence all along (he had given me his personal cell number for me to use\nas needed), and I was touched by his taking the time to chat with me about how I'm\ndoing.\nThe town cancelled trick or treating tonight because of a tornado watch! It's been rainy,\ngray and chilly all day, with strong gusts of wind whipping up the leaves -- weather\nappropriate for Halloween or tomorrow's Day of the Dead (All Souls'/Toussaint).\nUnfortunately, I ate a lot of the chocolate I had bought for the trick or treaters so I'll have\nto get some more (although kids rarely seem to come around this neighborhood, and not\nmany live here).\nRather than wallowing in the late October gloom right now, I'd rather be at a conference\nI often go to, in sunny Sarasota. Granted, I didn't send in a proposal for this conference\nthis year (as I now most often gravitate towards history conferences), but many\ndelightful friends/colleagues are there and the pictures now being posted on Facebook\nreveal a lovely venue, colleagues drinking cocktails at a rooftop bar, research being\nshared, conversations and laughter etc. Once again that feeling of being sidelined and\nwondering how and when I will be able to jumpstart my professional life. It feels like I've\nlived a whole other, alternate life in the meanwhile.\nIn much happier news, this weekend two of my graduate school bffs, Shanny and\nIsabelle, will be driving out from New York to visit me! I very much look forward to seeing\nthese two dear 'filles' (as we've always called each other) for a few days of hanging,\ncooking, reminiscing, laughing riotously, sharing. dancing (Shanny's request!) and more.\nAnd the visit's perfectly timed to keep my mind off my *last* chemo treatment this\ncoming Monday.\n  \n                       226 / 1.901",

    "entry": "228 / 1.901\n                       229 / 1.901\nI finished my last of six rounds of chemo today. Over the course of an eight-hour day at\nDr. Patel's office, everything went smoothly, and my blood counts were fine. I placed a\nsmall figurine of the Hindu god Ganesh, a gift from my friend Shanny, on the arm rest\nnext to me during treatment; Ganesh is the god that both places obstacles in one's path\nand also removes them. I was grateful for two visits from friends in the morning: from\nJackie, a fellow \"IIIC,\" who brought good cheer and a vanilla milkshake (a sixteen-year\nOC and breast cancer survivor and a highly active, vibrant woman, she is inspirational)\nand from Kathryn, with whom it's always uplifting to chat. So kind of them to make time\nto spend with me.\nI am relieved to be done with this part of the treatment. Dr. Mehta even authorized me\nto have *one* cocktail (I am jonesing for a stiff Manhattan or a Negroni - anyone care to\njoin me?). I can't really have more than that as my liver is working overtime these days...\nI need to stress strongly, though, both to myself and anyone reading this, that my\njourney seems far from over. Dr. Patel even said something like: \"it's going to be a long\nhaul,\" or something like that. My CA125 marker for ovarian cancer has dropped after\neach infusion, but is still 51.2, which Dr. Patel said was \"persistently on the higher side\"\nand \"concerning.\" It could mean that not all the cancer cells were killed off during this\npart of the treatment (a particularity of my type of ovarian cancer, as I think I've noted,\nis that a portion of my cancer cells are both microscopic and unusually aggressive), or\nmaybe it could mean something else (I'm not sure what, but at times I've heard this\nmarker referred to as \"just part of the picture\"). My stomach abscess also must resolve\nso as not to hinder my further treatment. For example, I have not yet been able to\nreceive Avastin, a strong drug that might have helped kill cancer cells, because it would\nhave worsened the stomach abscess problem. Dr. Patel told me that having these types\nof abscesses along with cancer is fairly uncommon. It's complicated my treatment.\nI'll learn a lot when I go to Hopkins on 11/19. I will have a CT scan of my abdomen, pelvis\nand chest, meet with both Drs. Beavis and Mehta (who is overseeing the stomach\nabscess part of the equation). Along with Dr. Patel, they will determine a follow-up\ntreatment plan, if any, and will also discuss timetable for removing the stomach drain. I\nam placing a lot of trust in them. The next step will be to repair my fistula, if it hasn't\nhealed on its own. This will be done either laparoscopically or surgically (which would be\nmuch more invasive). My brother Ethan has very kindly offered to join me in Baltimore\nfor this visit.\nSo while I could definitely feel myself tearing up when Dr. Patel told me that my marker\n(actually the previous marker of 57) was \"concerning\" (raising the possibility at least that\nI won't go into remission after this first treatment), I will try to get myself to a better\nplace emotionally and psychologically. I am \"stable\" (per Dr. Patel), really pretty strong\nin terms of overall conditioning; I walk, drive, go out with friends, have not had any\n                       230 / 1.901\nfevers, notable nausea, colds etc. If the marker is persistently on the higher side, at least\nit's trended downwards each time. And if I could survive a thirteen-hour surgery, I'll be\nready for whatever they throw at me next. [btw, Dr. Patel put my mind to rest about the\ndischarge coming from my stomach drainage tube; he said it's just a reaction to a\nforeign object being placed in my skin and does not believe it is an infection of any sort].\nI had a terrific time with \"mes filles,\" Shanny and Isabelle over the weekend. We gabbed\nnon-stopped, giggled mightily, laughed uproariously over old pictures from our grad\nschool days, reminisced, cooked a nice dinner together (actually, Isa and Shanny did\nmost of the cooking), did a little dancing to r&b tunes as we have done many times in\nthe past, ate some goodies from NY and NJ (rugelach, superior bread and bagels), sat in\nthe sun in the beautiful arboretum, enjoyed a relaxing coffee on the porch at Cafe\nLemont, drove out pretty Rte 45 to Milheim for brunch at Elk Creek cafes, watching the\nAmish buggies roll by. Thanks to Shanny's strong interest in spirituality, we also held a\ncrystal over our hand to obtain answers to certain pressing questions in our lives (the\ncrystal moved one way for yes and another for no). While I can't reveal everything about\nour experience in divination, I do have a scoop to share, confirmed by each of us asking\nthe crystal the same question: Trump will *not* be reelected president in 2020! Finally,\nShanny taught us a 'loving kindness meditation,' which is ultimately supposed to\nencourage that quality in ourselves. I will practice it with the travel meditation kit she\nbrought me (Isa brought me gorgeous candlesticks from Vienna with a Klimt design on\nthem). We three are working out a plan to spend a few nights at a retreat (called Kipralu)\nin the Berkshires in December, hopefully with a few other of our other NYU friends. In\nany event, it was a wonderful visit, spent reaping the rewards of nearly forty years of\nfriendship, including sharing all the ups and downs that life has placed in our path.\nThe massive fatigue has not yet hit me but may well do so tomorrow. Still, I asked my\nneighbor if she would drive me to vote at some point as I feel strongly about that. I may\nbe in my sweats, half asleep, and look like a ragamuffin, but I hope to get there!\nThe challenge of living with a serious disease that may not be definitively curable while\nat the same time living a meaningful life and continuing to define what that means for\nmyself.\nThanks so much for the many caring texts yesterday and today, and for the comfort food\nmeals for the next few days. I appreciate them so much. Please keep me in your\nthoughts and prayers going forward too, if it's not too much trouble.\nLove,\nWilla \nPhotos\n                       231 / 1.901\n                       232 / 1.901\n                       233 / 1.901\n                       234 / 1.901",

You are doing well in your realistic approach to your\nproblem and to making absolutely the most of the good days.\nYou mentioned, a day or two ago, that you and friends were thinking of going to Kripalu\nwhen you are feeling better.

On the way home, we stopped at nearby Kripalu just to take a\nlook. While Canyon was very luxurious, Krpalu was more basic, but everyone who's been\nthere seems to have liked it. At the time, they offered only dorm-type rooms but may\nhave upgraded since then\nSuzanne and I were diagnosed one month apart, in 2001, with breast cancer.

Blaze was very blue today as the\ncontinuous downpour dampened his (and my) usual enthusiasm for frequent walks, so I\nsuspect your feeling of thumb-twiddling/ wasting time was shared by many.

    "entry": "\"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in/And stops my mind from wandering where it will\ngo....\"\nA therapy session was helpful today in starting to raise me out of the funk I'd fallen into\nthe past few days, maybe the past week (since my final round of chemo last Monday). I\nspend a lot of time alone, thinking, letting my mind wander \"where it will go.\" I also\nspend a lot of time horizontal, either sleeping or resting. While much of this time likely\nserves a beneficial purpose - my body needs the rest to gain strength and combat\ndisease -- some of it seems more avoidant, of the \"pull the quilt up over my head and\ncheck out of reality\" variety. I can usually tell the difference. \nI know I am anxious about my appointments at Hopkins next week. A lot is riding on\nthem. The CT scan should reveal whether the six rounds of chemo were successful (ie it\nmay show NED - no evidence of disease - or, conversely, evidence of residual cancer).\nEither result will determine a further course of treatment (PARP inhibitors as\nmaintenance therapy? more chemo? more surgery??). And I presume how 'well' I pass\nthis milestone will inflect my prognosis. This in turn will have implications for whether\nand in what form I can return to work in January. And so much of it is out of my hands,\ndespite being centered in my body, ie in what is 'closest' to me. This morning, the\n\"Serenity Prayer\" went through my mind: \"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot\nchange, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference.\" I am very grateful that my\nbrother, Ethan, will travel from NY to Baltimore to be with me during my appointments. I will appreciate his\nsteady and compassionate presence.\nMy anxiety about the appointments had started to spin wildly and weepily into terror of a\nshorter than anticipated lifespan and separation from loved ones. This feeling of grief is\nso powerful it's hard even to write about it.\n                       241 / 1.901\nIn any event, what I realized today is that while the quantity of life I have left (or that any\nof us has left) is likely among the \"things I cannot change\" (beyond, of course, practicing\ngood self-care etc.), I can change its quality to some extent. I can do my part to ensure\nthat my interactions with beloved family, friends etc. are meaningful and impactful. I\nmay not be able to do that incredible hike my friend Mitchel and I took two years ago\ntoday to a hill town overlooking Nice and the Mediterranean (thank you, Facebook\nMemories), but I can treasure its memory, and remind him of that lovely day (and future\nsuch hikes are not outside the realm of possibility!). I hope this all doesn't sound too\ncorny or Pollyanna-ish, but I've needed to get 'unstuck' and feel that I'm making some\nprogress towards that goal.\nDuring services at shul, we thank our 'foremothers' -- Rebecca, Rachel, Leah, Sarah -- for\n'girding on' faith when times got tough and for being an example of virtuous behavior for\nus. A mystical faith also seemed to be an inspiration for Harriet Tubman in leading over\n70 slaves to freedom, per the biopic I saw this weekend. While I'm skeptical (at least at\nthis point) that faith is going to be my prime motivator through this ordeal, I will at least\ntry to continue to 'gird on' courage, wherever it may come from (the support of family\nand friends is a huge inspiration and source of support).\nIt's been warm enough to enjoy a cappuccino outdoors in the sun and then a nice walk\nby the PA Military Museum with my friend Monique. Grateful for the autumn sunshine as\nlong as it lasts.",

    "entry": "The news is the best I could have hoped for: today's CT scan revealed that I am in\nremission (which for Dr. Beavis means that \"nothing obvious appeared on the scan\"). So\nI am among the 80% of women who go into remission after debulking surgery followed\nby chemo. Normally, in a week I can also discontinue the two antibiotics I've been taking\nby infusion for several months. This feels like a wonderful 'reprieve' in the context of a\npunishing disease, and I will certainly take it! Dr. Beavis and Dr. Westin (another\nwonderful doctor in the gynoc practice) stressed to me that I am now entering a new\nphase -- the 'survivorship' stage -- during which I can and should begin to focus on\nresuming my 'old' life to the extent possible -- beginning with enjoying the upcoming\nholidays!\nI had not anticipated such welcome news. Because my CA125 level (ovarian cancer\nmarker) was \"concerning,\" according to Dr. Patel, I surmised it was because I had\nresidual cancer. Drs. Beavis and Westin explained to me, though, that that number could\nreflect *any* inflammation in the abdominal area, including the abscess that is still\ndraining in my abdomen.\nI am now also entering the \"surveillance\" stage. This means that Drs. Beavis and Patel\nwill be keeping very close watch on me through blood work, exams, CT scans, PET scans\netc.; the first six to twelve months are especially crucial. I will see one or the other of\nthem every three months. The issue regarding my fistula also must be resolved, but Dr.\nBeavis wants to let my body recover completely from the chemo before the fistula is\nrepaired. So I will return to Hopkins the first week in January to determine whether -- if\nthe fistula has not closed on its own -- it will be repaired laparoscopically or surgically. If\nthe latter, the recovery time will be much longer (about six weeks). This in turn will pose\n                       246 / 1.901\nproblems regarding whether I can return to work in January, as I'm hoping to. There are a\nnumber of important, complicated matters such as this that I have to figure out now... \nI also have to decide whether to take chemo drugs called PARP inhibitors as a\nmaintenance therapy. According to the newest studies, these inhibitors can delay\nrecurrences by several months, but they have no curative function. On the other hand,\nthey have side effects (fatigue, nausea, lowered blood counts). It's a quality v. quantity\nof life decision. Another tough one...\nCarpe diem seems even more urgent given that half the women in my position (ie\novarian cancer patients who have had debulking surgery plus chemo) have a recurrence\nwithin five years. A sobering statistic. Others, of course -- and I have met some of them --\nhave recurrences between five and ten years out. Cancer-free for ten years is considered\ncured. \nStill plenty of uncertainty, then, but for now there is reason for modest or even less\nmodest celebration (perhaps I'll indulge in that one cocktail I'm allowed to have...).\nMy brother has been my stalwart companion/'ride or die' the past two days and I'm ever\nso grateful to him for being by my side during my appointments. The upside is that\nwe've been able to catch up and simply hang out together (we had a wonderful Italian\nmeal at La Scala last night, and were glued to the impeachment hearings this morning).\nThank you, Ethan. :) \nThanks to friends and family members who sent texts, emails.

    "entry": "Each phase of this disease has its challenges. Transitioning from being a patient\n('victim??') to a survivor (although I realize the two categories can overlap) is fraught.\nWhy? First, while I'm certainly very relieved that Tuesday's CT scan showed nothing\nworrisome in terms of cancer regrowth, I also know that a recurrence is likely; it seems\nto me that the word \"remission\" would need to be qualified in some way. It feels like a bit\nof a swindle. Next, in all honesty I have probably felt 'wedded to my disease' in some\nway; it provided me with an identity (I suppose 'survivor' does as well), and also ensured\nan outpouring of care and love from my 'village.' Now that I'm 'better,' will there be an\nexpectation on the part of others (and perhaps myself) that things return to 'normal' (or\nto the new normal, or the newer normal)? Finally, and related to the previous point,\nsimply returning to my life after going through such an arduous, even hellish experience\nsince April cannot be accomplished seamlessly, it seems to me. Perhaps every day\nfurther from chemo the easier the transition will become.\nThank you to everyone, though, for your warm outpouring of relief and enthusiasm on\nmy good news! If all goes as planned and I continue to feel well, I have a bit of a reprieve\nuntil January, when I will need to have my fistula repaired at JH, hopefully in the least\ninvasive way possible...\nA wise and compassionate woman who is a fellow survivor was able to articulate exactly\nwhat I'm feeling, and offered some sage advice (I hope she won't mind my quoting her\ntext here, but I'm not including her name for confidentiality purposes): \"It's tough on us\nemotionally when treatment ends and we are left on our own [...] One day at a time. Live\nyour precious life well! It's a gift. Enjoy it. Celebrate it. And lastly, lean on other survivors\nwho KNOW the feeling [...] we are in treatment forever. Our lives have changed. The\nblinders are off. So your job now...live love laugh. That overused statement is so true.\"\nDrs. Beavis and Westin also stressed to me that my mission now, from their perspective,\n                       252 / 1.901\nis to live my life to the fullest. I suppose I'm the type of person who always tries to\npractice this, but perhaps there's more urgency or purposefulness about that now. I am\ngreatly looking forward, for starters, to Ben coming home on Tuesday for the holiday! We\nwill be going to Michael (Ben's dad) and Sue's, and I'm sure we'll have a lovely holiday. I\nspent part of the afternoon cooking a *vat* of cranberry chutney (jalapeno cornbread\nand sweet potato casserole to follow). \nIt occurred to me that now that the 'initial treatment' chapter of my journey is over, I\nshould end my journal, or at least go on hiatus. But I suppose that I still have things I\nwant to write, and as long as I do I'll keep going. Thank you for taking the time to read\nmy posts.\nP.S. Dr. Beavis wrote me to say that she thinks I am doing \"remarkably well given\neverything [I've] been through\" -- hopeful words...",

After fearing starting chemo, I actually went through a panic phase at\nthe end where I was scared to stop chemotherapy. It took me a while to come to term\nwith the fact that active treatment was over and I was entering the maintenance phase.

    "entry": "I have been thinking about this distinction ever since Drs. Beavis and Westin exhorted\nme to grab life by the horns and ride it hard during this 'honeymoon' period of remission.\nI associate 'survival' with specific images from the past six months -- waking up in the\nICU after a thirteen hour surgery with a breathing tube down my throat, barely able to\npress the pump with pain meds that were providing some relief from the excruciating\npain in my abdomen; having a needle inserted into my back (and I think my lung?) to\ndrain two quarts of fluid; inability to keep any food or liquid down for days. 'Survivorship,'\nI'm learning, is something else; it is forward looking, hopeful. It resides in the 'sweet\nspot' between acceptance (or non-denial) of a probable recurrence -- if I remain fixated\non the probability of a recurrence, am I somehow complicit in the idea that 'remission'\nmay be to some extent a swindle? -- and the courage to move forward or simply to\n*move* in some direction. It is the courage, in the works of a song I like by Debbie\nFriedman (Mi Shebeirach/Prayer for Healing), to \"make one's life a blessing.\"\nFor the first time since late April, I have begun to make some forward looking plans. In\nthinking about how I want to use my time to *live* I actually focused on what I would\nmiss most when I *die.* This strategy, if one can call it hat, was suggested in an NPR\ninterview I read with BJ Miller, a highly inspirational, brilliant palliative care doctor, whose\nnew book, A Beginner's Guide to the End, I have put on my reading list (turns out this\n'how to die well' book is all about *life,* which echoes my strong feeling that until we are\ndead we are *living* and not 'dying,' and our lives can and do have meaning until the\nend). This strategy of focusing on death to chart a path in life simplified things for me: I\nwould most miss Ben, the rest of my family, my friends, and meaningful work (those\nwere the first things that came to me, although I might have added travel; there may\nwell be others!).\nConsequently, today I booked a trip to D.C. between Xmas and New Year's (treating\nmyself to a favorite hotel there...), bought my Megabus ticket to New York, where I will\nspend some time after the 13th, and further firmed up plans for a yoga/wellness retreat\nin the Berkshires next week with four dear friends from grad school. Finally, remaining\ndetails are pending, but I'm now expecting to return to work in January in conditions that\nwill work well for me right now. I'm feeling energized by all these developments\n(although I hope I haven't overdone it...). Now I just need to keep fingers firmly crossed\nthat my health holds  -- nothing is guaranteed and those cancer cells may well be\nlurking, although I benefited from a very aggressive debulking surgery in May -- and that\nI continue to regain my strength. I will have the procedure to repair the fistula in my\nabdomen at the beginning of January. Fingers crossed again that the necessary\nprocedure will be minimally invasive. The degree of invasiveness will be determined, also\nin January, by a 'fistulagram' revealing the exact size and nature of the fistula.\nIn my 'thankfulness' list from my last post, I need to add that I am enormously grateful to\n                       265 / 1.901\nmy college classmate Steven Sherman, an endocrinologist at MD Anderson Cancer\nCenter in Houston. When I contacted Steve via Facebook for help/information in an utter\npanic after receiving my diagnosis last April, he immediately got on the phone to several\noncologist colleagues, telling me \"we'll get you situated.\" Very shortly after that, he\nhooked me up with the gyn oncs at Hopkins (where Steve completed part of his medical\nstudies and where one of his colleagues specializes in ovarian tumors). I received a call\nfrom Dr. Anna Beavis a day or two after that. We spent an hour speaking by phone. As\nluck would have it, she happened to have an opening for a lengthy surgery for the\nfollowing week. Fortuitously, then, I very quickly found my way into expert hands, and I\nreally owe this to Steve. :)",

    "entry": "268 / 1.901\n                       269 / 1.901\nMy dear friend Shanny, whom  I can't wait to see on Wednesday when we trek north\nfrom NYC to Kripalu Yoga and Wellness Center in Lenox, MA, recently sent me a care\npackage composed of several thoughtful gifts, including crystals, some \"Inner Strength\"\nloose tea, and \"contemplation cards\" consisting of words to meditate on, discuss, absorb.\nThe first word I chose at random was \"detoxify.\" I eagerly await several days of\n\"detoxifying\" with four wonderful grad school friends (aka \"les filles\") at Kripalu, where\nI've booked both a massage and a facial and which boasts energizing yoga classes, a\nrelaxing sauna, idyllic surroundings in the Berkshires and food that's - apparently -  both\nhealthful and delicious. And lots of laughs and sharing guaranteed with this crew.\nI should have borne detoxifying in mind on Thursday, when some poor eating choices\n(nuts, dried fruits, greasy Thai take out) may have contributed to my going to bed with\nexcruciating stomach pain, which eventually became so bad that I called an EMS\nambulance at 2 a.m. to take me to the ER. I stayed at the hospital in State College the\nbetter part of the day, and was well attended to. Saw four doctors both in the ER and\nthen on the floor once I was admitted, who told me the CT scan revealed a 'lazy bowel'\nor perhaps the beginning of a bowel obstruction (this no longer appears to be the case). I\nalso needed an infusion of magnesium. Over the course of the day I began to feel better\nand was released c. 5 p.m. I had a few teary moments of 'aloneness' in the hospital, but\nin the end felt I had made the right decision, given all my abdominal issues resulting\nfrom the big surgery last May, to err on the side of caution and get the pain checked\nout. \n \nIn the interest of detoxifying, I changed my order at the last minute at a soul-warming\nlunch today with the \"III Cs\" (local OC survivors) plus our mutual friend Aileen Galley (see\nphoto), who in the context of her former job was responsible for bringing these OC\nsurvivors together. Instead of the spicy and carb-heavy Thai chicken salad, I opted for\nthe protein-rich scallop salad. Eliminating 'toxins' of all sorts, in all realms of my life,\nseems essential to strong survivorship.\nA few updates: the procedure to repair my fistula is scheduled for Jan. 3rd. I'll meet Dr.\nHolly, the interventional radiologist who will perform the procedure, on the 2nd. I am\nrooting for the less invasive 'patching' procedure. Getting my head around another open\nsurgery would be hard for me to deal with right now....\n...and would delay my return to work, now scheduled for the beginning of next semester.\nI'll be returning in optimal conditions given the major health challenges of the past six\nmonths: I won't be department head, nor will I be teaching. My interim department head,\ndean, and HR staff have been very compassionate in working out this arrangement with\nme. I'll perform service (committees, specific tasks for the department etc.), work with\nthe graduate students whose dissertations I'm directing or am involved with, and\n                       270 / 1.901\nhopefully push forward with my research. If my health holds, I'll likely return to the\nheadship in the fall. I am looking forward to feeling useful and returning to the work that\nI enjoy very much and to the collegial atmosphere on campus. I just pray that my\nstamina and health hold and that my return to work will be unproblematic.\nIn other news: let the fun continue in DC, where we've booked both dinner at a buzz-\ngenerating restaurant (The Queen's English, featuring Hong Kong cuisine) and tickets for\na concert by the Roots (Questlove!) at the Kennedy Center. Can't wait to see Ben (whom\nI'll also see in NY next weekend) and Sammi, and perhaps a few friends if the scheduling\nworks out.\nSo I'm on the road again, as I love to be, Megabussing it to the city tomorrow. This will be\nmy first non-medical travel since April! Happy trails, all.",

    "entry": "272 / 1.901\n                       273 / 1.901\nWhen I awoke in the ICU following my thirteen-hour debulking surgery in May, the only\nway I realized for sure that I was alive was by hearing the sound of my breathing. Slowly,\nother parts of my body came into focus: I could wiggle my fingers and toes, see the\noutline of a clock on the wall in front of me.\nIn retrospect, \"breathing\" seemed a central focus of my restorative recent stay at Kripalu\nCenter for Yoga and Health in Stockbridge, MA, in part a celebration of my long\nfriendship (37 years!) with Isabelle, Vinni and Shanny, whom I met at age 23 in grad\nschool at NYU (in various combinations, we've been roommates over the years too, in\nboth New York and Paris). Many of the wonderful classes (eg Gentle Yoga and the\nparticularly excellent, body- and soul-freeing Yoga Dance) and workshops (Seven Steps\nto Aging Well) I attended focused on breathing techniques, on calming the body, de-\nstressing, letting go to the point where if I closed my eyes and let myself drift I could\nenvision a calmer version of myself, wearing my purple chemo cap and wrapped in a soft\ngray blanket, floating above my physical being.\nLife-sustaining breath also enabled my body to impress me with its stamina, given all it's\nbeen through since May. With my friends I walked at least a mile if not more over snow\ncovered trails through pine groves to a pretty lake; granted, this is much less than I am\nnormally capable of walking but nowadays because of lingering discomfort in my\ndiaphragm/abdominal area I tend to get winded after a while. I also took two vigorous\nyoga classes the same day -- balanced (following the mantra of \"we deserve it!\") by a\nrelaxing aromatherapy massage, Dr. Hauschka facial, and stimulating dip in the\nwhirlpool.\nI embraced the focus on well-being, including the emphasis on 'conscious eating.' The\nmeals, despite being prepared for what seemed like a full house of 600 or more\nguests,** were unusually delicious and healthful: the breakfast buffet one day featured\npumpkin brioche French toast with local maple syrup; yummy cold sesame noodles and a\nportabella mushroom 'lasagna' were served lunch, and shrimp in cilantro pesto for dinner\n(I also loved the creamy parsley feta salad dressing, one of about six homemade\ndressings available). **quite a cool 'scene,' about 80% women, lots of toned bodies and\nsome not so toned, and a great variety of interesting yoga attire; with my purple chemo\nskullcap, dangly silver earrings and lovely Indian shawl that Vinni gifted me I did not feel\nout of place!\nMy friend Shanny, both highly adept at yoga and knowledgeable about various forms of\nnon-Western spirituality, encouraged us other 'filles' (French for 'gals,' as we've called\neach other for years...) to set an intention for the day. \"Listen to your body\" became my\nintention one day (especially pertinent after my recent trip to the ER), \"be gentle with\nyourself\" was the guiding principle for the following day (following a night of less sleep\n                       274 / 1.901\nthan I usually need).\nFriendship is an essential nutrient in my emotional and spiritual diet. The opportunity to\nreconnect with three of my closest friends was, consequently, soul-warming. Like the\ntwenty-somethings we once were, we still giggle and often laugh raucously when\ntogether (enhanced by some *legal* 'contraband' smuggled into the center for the\noccasion...), speak in franglais, take ridiculously goofy selfies, and stay up late at our\nimpromptu slumber parties; we also had fun asking a crystal pendulum all sorts of\nquestions both silly and serious. Yet now our gossip sessions are intermixed with other\nconcerns: recent illness and death of parents, disease (two of us are cancer survivors),\nworries about our kids, career-related issues, the prospect of retirement. In short, the All\nof It. Shanny and I spent an additional seven hours or so gabbing in the car from\nBrooklyn to the Berkshires and back. Our convo roamed from relationships of all sorts\n(familial, romantic, marital, with our exes and friends etc.) to spirituality to climate\nchange to the meaningful concept of wabi-sabi, a Japanese esthetic that stresses the\nbeauty that comes with imperfection, flaws and age (exemplified by rust or cracks in\nporcelain). Hopefully my sternum to pubis scar (my 'battle scar') also manifests this\nconcept -- the 'crack' or brokenness that, in Leonard Cohen's lyric from \"Anthem,\" lets\nthe light in (\"There is a crack, a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in\").\nIn short, it was a wonderful, relaxing, fun and meaningful getaway, one that we hope to\nmake into an annual tradition.\n*** \nI am grateful to be in the city for the week, reveling in a welcome change of scene,\nspending time with family and friends (Ben was up from DC yesterday and we enjoyed a\nfamily dinner at my mother's apartment with my brother, sister-in-law and nephew). A\nspecial treat today was meeting Diane, another \"IIIC\" OC survivor about a year out from\nchemo (and a member of my extended family). It was encouraging for me to both share\ninformation and experiences (eg about post-surgery complications) and meet another OC\nsurvivor who appears to be thriving (Diane was back to work very shortly after\ncompleting chemo). The support and friendship of other OC survivors has come to be\nquite important for my own continued forward-looking survivorship. I share a depth of\nunderstanding with these women that is unique to our experience.\n***\nOn another note: if anyone is available to drive me to Hopkins on the morning of Jan. 2nd\n(*actually, it will most likely need to be Jan. 1st) and/or pick me up most likely the\nmorning of Jan. 4th (but that is still tbd), it would, of course, help me out immensely.\n***\nAll's well.\nNamaste",

    "entry": "\"A heart in New York, a rose on the street\nI write my song to that city heartbeat\"\nIf friends are an essential nutrient in my diet -- and in my *recovery* diet -- than my hometown is as well.\nSpending the week in the city energized me, as it often does, and actually made me feel better. Can a city, or\nany special place, really do that? Granted, I made sure not to overdo the running around and, except for one\nforay to the UWS (Upper West Side), retained downtown as my center of gravity. My mother also kindly\nmade sure I was especially comfortable in her apartment, even installing me in her bedroom for the week\nwhile she slept on the sofa bed in the second bedroom. So for the most part I continued to get the extra\nsleep I still need. :) And the security blanket of family feels especially welcome and safe these days. We (my\nbrother, sis-in-law Ronit, niece Eve and nephew Isaac, my mother and her partner Arnold, and Ben who was\n                       277 / 1.901\nup from DC for the weekend) enjoyed a family dinner/pizza party one evening at my mother's apartment. A\nfew days later, my mother, niece and I braved the deep freeze of the tip of Manhattan island (Bowling Green)\nto shop at an Alsatian-style holiday market, before seeking out some hot soup.\nFriends + family +/in New York = a nutrient with a special boost. I am just sorry that I couldn't see more\nfriends during this stay. I had a perfectly zen moment yesterday morning (thank you, Lexapro?) sitting in the\nmidst of incredible bustle at Breads Bakery on 16th street, where my brother Ethan and I treated my mother\nto a birthday breakfast (see pics). Somehow, the long line to get coffee, tables jammed together and turning\nover constantly, and employees hurriedly pushing carts of fragrant, warm baked goods all blended into what\nbecame a pleasant 'whoosh,' creating a cocoon of sound that was, simultaneously, comforting, slightly\n'exotic' because so far removed from the absolute stillness I am used to at night in State College, and yet\nfamiliar to me from my growing up years in the city and my grad school years at NYU. Will I wind up back in\nNYC one day? There's certainly a good chance of it, but who knows? \nGiven that I'm generally feeling well right now and am really starting to regain energy (please may it\ncontinue...), I am overjoyed to be back to one of my favorite activities -- breaking bread (hopefully, notably\ngood bread...) and diving into conversation w/a friend or relative in an interesting/cool/relaxing setting. Over\ndelicious udon noodles in curry broth (perfect for a downright frigid day in the city), my college friend Josh\nbrought wisdom from his long practice of martial arts and wrote me this email after lunch, encouraging me to\nchannel what I might call my 'innner samurai:' \"You may discover an inner resilience as you've never noticed\nbefore--the stalk of bamboo rather than a brittle iron rod--and observe parts you never knew were working inside you. If it\nis toughness there, you may need even more toughness. If it is gentleness there, then you may find even greater\ngentleness.\" And over a brunch that turned into a lunch at the wonderful Marlton Hotel (in a renovated 1900 building in the\nVillage), another dear college friend, Bryan, encouraged me to rethink my diet with the goal of even greater healthfulness\n(smoothies, apparently, might be key); I felt guilty eating even a few of the yummy frites accompanying the mini-turkey\nmeatball and mozzarella panini we shared, but do intend to be even more mindful than currently about my diet. I am so\ngrateful for the sage advice of my friends. I hope I can pay it back and/or forward...\nHeading back to State College tomorrow for the week; I'll see Dr. Patel on Tuesday to discuss maintenance\ntherapy, have my port flushed, and have blood taken for my upcoming procedure at Hopkins. Next Friday I'll\nfly to to DC to visit Ben. In a change of plans, instead of returning to SC for basically one day, I will likely stay\nin DC over New Year's (at Ben's, while he is in NY) and then head to Baltimore on New Year's Day to get\nready for my appointments and (hopefully) procedure on the 2nd/3rd (my mother is kindly meeting me there).\nIf any State College peeps are driving back from Baltimore/DC on the 3rd or 4th and could give me a ride it\nwould, as ever, be greatly appreciated!\nPics: 1) NY is getting ready for Chanukah with four kinds of sufganiyot (jelly doughnuts); 2) Breakfast w/the\nbirthday girl (aka mom) at Breads Bakery; 3) Very yummy hot Ukranian borscht at Veselka, an iconic\nrestaurant on lower Second Avenue.\nPhotos\n                       278 / 1.901\n                       279 / 1.901\n                       280 / 1.901\n                       281 / 1.901",

    "entry": "283 / 1.901\n                       284 / 1.901\nWritten by the glow of the menorah...\n \nLight is life, and I especially welcome its presence, illuminating the dark corners, not just\nduring the most lightless days of the year (I love the convergence of the solstice and\nChanukah) but at the end of a year that was often pitch dark for me. Chanukah also\ncommemorates the victory of the few over the many, the triumph of spirit over military\nmight -- \"not by might, not by power, but by spirit alone.\" Yes, spirit, I've learned, can be\nremarkably strong and resilient. As for the 'miracle' part, in the case of the small vial of\noil that lasted for eight days -- \"Do you believe in miracles?\" sings Matisyahu -- I'm not\nnecessarily convinced. And warfare leaves me cold. And yet, there is beauty and\nmeaning in this 'festival of lights.'\nCan light drive out the darkness that has cast our nation into such horrific chaos for the\npast two years? I pray so. \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.\nHate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that,\" wrote Martin Luther King, wisely. As\nfor my own 'dark corners,' I currently need more clarity about whether or not to take a\nmaintenance chemo drug called a PARP inhibitor that data suggests can delay a\nrecurrence but that can have some undesirable side effects (exhaustion, vomiting,\nnausea) and that seems to work better in patients who are BRCA positive, (which is not\nmy case; instead of having a hereditary component, my cancer is the result of a random\ngenetic mutation). This morning, my medical oncologist, Dr. Patel, did not express a\nstrong opinion on this (but said, variously, \"let's wait until after your fistula is repaired\"\nor \"please consult Dr. Beavis to see whether she has data on success rates for patients\nsuch as you, who are BRCA negative and had/have a lot of cancer\" -- that last part of\nhis comments really stuck in my throat...). Dr. Beavis, in turn, has initially left the choice\nabout whether or not to take the PARP inhibitors -- which have no curative effect -- up to\nme, so I really hope I'll be able to further consult her on this at Hopkins when I am there\nJan. 2-3. Apparently, at Sloan Kettering they do not even prescribe PARP inhibitors to\nwomen who are BRCA negative and who have responded well to first-line chemo.\nSo....much...uncertainty, which is frustrating and anxiety-provoking.  I will get further\ninput and try to make the best informed decision I can. My vitals were all good this\nmorning so there is that, and I continue to feel stronger, with little need for rest during\nthe day.\nI was also thrown into 'obscurity' briefly today when no pharmacy in town appeared to\nhave the saline-filled syringes that I need to flush my stomach drain. After about seven\nphone calls, though, I found a pharmacy that carries them, got my prescription\ntransferred from the pharmacy I usually use, and will pick them up tomorrow.\nIt was lovely to have coffee today with a favorite undergraduate student, and to revel in\nthe \"normalcy\" of that welcome, relaxing \"down time\" feeling I associate with winter\n                       285 / 1.901\nbreak in our much quieter than usual college town. She gifted me a cool candle\nembedded with pieces of volanic lava from her trip to Iceland over Thanksgiving break. I\nfeel incredibly touched to also receive, today, a homemade holiday cranberry bread,\nwhich one of my neighbors hand delivered, and a gift bag containing an interesting-\nlooking novel and a divine-smelling product from Occitane awaiting me on my doorstep,\nfrom a very kind friend. I am trying to finish up my card writing before I leave for DC on\nFriday, although I find it hard to express my gratitude for all the love, care and concern,\nsupport and encouragement and generosity that's been showered on me this year.\nDozens of points of light in the darkness, for sure.\nWe enjoyed a sweet first-night celebration of Chanukah at synagogue last night -- candle\nlighting followed by a soup and latkes dinner. So nice to share this w/my community. I\nmet an intriguing-seeming man at the event -- a local chiropractor (and, apparently,\nactor) who divides his time between State College and NYC (where he also has a 'healing\narts' practice) and who grew up in SC (played football for PSU). We have a coffee date for\ntomorrow. Will anything come of it? Now *that* would be a Chanukah miracle. But living\none day at a time (still hard for a type-A person like myself) has taught me to be quite\nzen about encounters of all types... Wherever you go, there you are...",

    "entry": "287 / 1.901\n                       288 / 1.901\nThis past Friday morning bright and early (the sun was just starting to rise), as I sat at\nmy dining table eating a yogurt before getting ready to leave for DC (my neighbors\nkindly drove me to the airport), I decided to select a 'contemplation card' from the deck\nShanny had given me, hoping it might provide some food for reflection during my\nupcoming trip. I selected, at random, \"Journey.\" I placed the card in the window that\naccompanies the box holding the deck, making a mental note to contemplate later.\nAs if on cue (thank you, subconscious) that night, in DC, I had an exhausting (and\nexhaustive) dream about a journey; unfortunately, I didn't write it down immediately so I\nam forgetting some of the details. I was with a group but also, somehow, separate from\nthem. The journey consisted of portions by sea and by land (with sub-portions of this\nlatter phase with transportation and on foot). Each portion was marked by notable\nevents or occurrences. For example, during one portion I noticed that at least two people\nin the group had formed a couple. At long last we were at the very northern (I believe)\nedge of Harvard's campus with several miles to walk to our destination (which was\nunclear). Melded into this dream was another dream about resuming therapy (with my\nprevious therapist, not my current one) after this long journey. I was completely foggy on\nmy appointment time/date, because I had been away for so long. I took a chance and\nshowed up at what I believed to be the correct time/place. It's possible that a high school\nfriend of mine also showed up at the same time, but I don't remember more.\nAs if this voyage wasn't enough, I realized that the next day would be the last day of the\nsemester (at Penn State, I believe) and I had to prepare something for the session. I\ndecided it would be 'easy' to prepare a trivia quiz or game (and perhaps also a\n'hangman' game?) for the students, until I realized that generating questions for the quiz\nwould be very time-consuming. I also realized with dismay that in a course (similar to\none I've taught many times in reality) that was supposed to end with World War I, we\nhad only covered only up to 1850.\nMy not very enlightened interpretation of all this is that I've indeed been on the psychic,\nemotional and physical journey of a lifetime since my diagnosis in April, a journey\nconstituted of several phases. I've been well surrounded by a group of companions but\nhave also been going it alone. This journey has at times drawn my thoughts backwards\nin time (in the dream: Harvard, my previous therapist). Now that I'm returning to work in\nJanuary, I feel anxious -- this \"I'm unprepared for class\" dream is one I've had many\ntimes; interestingly, though, while I usually dream about the first day of class in this case\nit was the last day. Indeed, I missed the entire last semester as I was on medical leave,\n'reemerging' at campus events only at the very end of the semester when I started\nfeeling better. I am not certain what else to make about the end/beginning connection.\nThere's likely more stuff to tease out in the dream; perhaps it will come to me on further\n                       289 / 1.901\ncogitation.\nOf course, recently I've started to travel again, for the first time since my diagnosis. New\nYork and now Washington, where I'm spending a few days with my dear son. I am\ngenerally feeling well, despite some lingering and nearly chronic discomfort/tenderness\non my right side (near my drain insertion site). Dr. Patel said it's likely some\ninflammation but nothing to worry about. I am praying that this will not interfere with my\nupcoming procedure at Hopkins... But as Ben observed, my appetite is back with a\nvengeance. Ben, Sammi (Ben's delightful girlfriend) and I enjoyed some great meals at\nQueen's English (a trendy place in Columbia Heights featuring Hong Kong cuisine), Bistro\nLepic (a great neighborhood bistro in upper Georgetown that I discovered when I was\nstaying at Dumbarton Oaks about a year ago; they serve excellently prepared classics\nlike coquilles Saint-Jacques and sweetbreads, with profiteroles for dessert). I've regained\nabout ten pounds of the 25 I lost following surgery but am still feeling relatively trim. We\nalso walked about four miles on Saturday through Rock Creek Park to Hillwood Museum\nand Gardens, where we took a docent tour of Marjorie Merriweather Post's estate and\nstrolled the gardens (including a Japanese rock garden after my own heart...). Last night,\nafter seeing the crazily intense film \"Uncut Gems\" to  escape a downpour outside\n(followed by a shopping trip to Zara and walk around the newish Wharf District), we went\nto the Roots' concert at the Kennedy Center; unfortunately, the lyrics of this talented hip-\nhop group were unintelligible but I've been reading them online today. If \"living well is\nthe best revenge\" - against the Beast, in this case?... -- then I am throwing myself into it\npretty hard core, soaking it all up as I love to do. Please may it last.... it sure beats a\nhospital bed... Shortly, I'll pack up my stuff here in my hotel (the wonderful Mandarin\nOriental, where I sit now in my room on the top floor with a lovely view of the Tidal Basin\nand the Potomac) and Uber to Ben's, where I plan to finish out the year in a mellow\nmode. Ben and I will cook something at home tonight before he leaves to spend NYE in\nNew York, and I hope to have lunch with my friend Jeff tomorrow.\nSo Ben will travel from DC to New York, I will go from DC to Baltimore (and then return to\nState College on Saturday, hopefully), my mother will travel from NY to Baltimore to\nmeet me at Hopkins, and my brother is making a quick round trip from NY to Baltimore\nand back, to spend time, per tradition at the end of the year, with his college\nroommates.

    "entry": "292 / 1.901\n                       293 / 1.901\nHappily ensconced in Ben's bedroom in the row house where he lives on M Street,\noverlooking the small housing project and the huge white church that takes up almost a\ncity block (the United House of Prayer for All People of the Church of the Rock of the\nApostolic Faith). Ben and Sammi are in NYC for NYE, but I am here, cozily on this mild\nday, winding down the year (and decade). My friend/ex-bf Jeff met me for a while to\nselect some goodies at Buttercream Bakery, before sitting outside in the sun at La\nColombe cafe in Blagden Alley, catching up and trading tales as we like to do (see pic).\nHeaded to Baltimore at some point tomorrow. The PET-CT scan on Thursday, the results\nof which I will discuss that day with the interventional radiologist (Dr. Holly), will\ndetermine whether the procedure to repair my fistula laparoscopically can go forward\nthe next day. If the scan reveals significant fluid collection, for example (that niggling\nstomach abscess...), the procedure may well be off, to be replaced by an open surgery at\nanother date. There are no guarantees. I hope for the best outcome, but need to be\nprepared for a different one. I am not certain if the PET will also screen for any new or\nresidual cancer, but I presume it will. I'll also meet with my gyn onc, Dr. Beavis, on\nThursday afternoon.\nIn no way has cancer been a 'blessing,' in no way am I 'grateful' for having this disease.\nIn no way do I feel that \"God does not give you more than you can handle\" and/or\n\"everything happens for a reason.\" I understand that this counters the belief of several\nreligious traditions that find value in suffering. In no way was spending the night before\nmy 'mother of all surgeries' retching into a garbage can in my hotel room while my\nfamily looked on helplessly a redeeming experience, nor was the crushing post-chemo\nfatigue that had me waking up from seventeen-hour slumbers in a stunned stupor, nor\nwas feeling so overwhelmed I could scarcely make myself a cup of tea, nor was the fact\nof missing at least three friends' weddings and a long-planned trip to France with Ben,\nnor was having my entire life come crashing down around me, leaving me to grapple\nwith the possibility of a shorter than hoped-for lifespan.\nAnd yet...\nI will simply echo the measured words of my rabbi, David Ostrich, during a visit he paid\nme shortly after I returned home from my three-week post-surgery stay at Hopkins: \"You\nmay find that this experience offers some opportunity for learning:\"\n*I am stronger than I thought, both physically and mentally. It surprised me to learn that\nsome cancer patients, even at early stages of their treatment, feel they simply can't\ncontinue with it. Except for a few rare instants when feeling particularly debilitated and\noverwhelmed, this has never been my attitude. I'm still feeling well enough, and tough\nenough now, to say \"bring it on.\" I will keep fighting if need be (and it may very well be,\n                       294 / 1.901\ngiven the likelihood of a recurrence...)\n*Goodness exists, and it is powerful. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, and while fully\nconscious of the fact that evil, ugliness, and mean-spiritedness also exist in spades\n(examples too numerous to mention here, and in our faces every day), let me quote\nAnne Frank: \"It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and\nimpractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people\nare truly good at heart.\" One friend brought me a hamsa (protective hand symbol) that\nher mother had blessed at the Kotel in Jerusalem; another came by my house to check\non me when Ben and Michael were worried because they couldn't contact me (I was\ndeep into one of the aforementioned post-chemo big sleeps); another prepared a picnic\nand drove me to sit beside a calming creek on a gorgeous summer day; another drove\nme, twice, from State College to Baltimore; three others came to spend weekends with\nme, to help out with whatever was needed; others ran errands, made chicken noodle\nsoup, borscht, quiche, rice pudding (the prodigious Meal Train kept me fed for months...),\ntexted, called, emailed, sent cards, gorgeous floral arrangements, and other thoughtful\ngifts (one friend, envisioning me in a hospital gown, sent a colorful, elegant scarf),\nprayed, visited, drove me to doctors' appointments, slept over when I was feeling shaky,\nsat with me during chemo, brought me milkshakes when that was virtually all I could\nstomach, invited me on outings as I continued to improve, took care of everything I left\nhanging at work when I had to schedule surgery on short notice, added encouraging and\nperceptive comments to this page. My family members have continued to provide rock\nsolid love and support, accompanying me to Baltimore, providing strong arms to lean on\nwhen my post-surgery 'walks' extended to the house next door, and keeping up a\ncourageous front despite their fear. ETC. Goodness is restorative (and really beautiful\nand pure!). It manifests itself in countless ways. It continues to be an essential element\nin my recovery. I do feel privileged to have witnessed so many instances of grace.\nPerhaps, in some ways, I have learned to be a 'better' (ie kinder, more empathic) version\nof myself, too. I would be glad for that.\n*As I wrote earlier about my upcoming procedure, there are no guarantees. But I think I\nreally understand this now. It's become easier to say \"I love you\" -- and mean it -- to\nfriends and family. And I hold those hugs for longer, and squeeze tighter. No filter. No\nb.s. No day but today.\n*I am intoxicated by life, and unready to leave it.\nThat's what I've learned so far.\nWishing everyone a healthy, happy, successful, fun, peaceful, loving and blessed new\nyear.\nLove, Willa \n                       295 / 1.901",

    "entry": "It's 5:45 p.m. and I've just returned from a long day at Hopkins. There's been a lot to\nabsorb in one day; there is some news to feel good about yet, as Dr. Beavis confirmed\nand as I've said all along, some uncertainty as well.\nIt looks like I *will* have the laparoscopic (ie 'easier') procedure tomorrow morning, as\nhoped for. I met with Dr. Holly, the very confident and competent interventional\nradiologist -- and the go-to guy for this relatively new procedure -- who reviewed the PET-\nCT scan I had this morning (which took two hours and involved drinking two cups of a\nyucky barium drink). My stomach abscess has decreased in size to the point of pretty\nmuch resolving itself; this means that tomorrow a)I can have my stomach drain and\ndrainage bag, which I've tended to for months, removed (yay!) and b)the abscess does\nnot pose a risk for the procedure. The procedure will involve a wire, a catheter and a\nlaser, the result being a 'scarring' (maybe like cauterizing?) of the tissue around the\nfistula (hole), closing it. I will be lightly sedated. There is a chance that the fistula will\nhave closed on its own already (the doctor won't know until he 'goes in'): best case\nscenario. Otherwise, he will close it. The procedure, he told me, is successful in 2/3 of\n                       297 / 1.901\ncases. If it winds up not succeeding -- which will be revealed by a follow up CT scan,\nlikely in State College in a few weeks -- they can make a second attempt at the\nprocedure. I am not sure what would happen if that second attempt fails. Dr. Beavis said\nto me later that the option of open surgery is \"still on the table.\"\nWith Dr. Beavis, later this afternoon, we reviewed the results of the PET scan. The\n*preliminary* radiologist's report indicates that there is an area near where my small and\nlarge intestine meet that *may* be a metastatis (or it may simply be an inflammation, as\nDr. Patel had thought). There is another fluid pocket in the lung that *may* be\nsuspicious. The CT scan in a few weeks may/should bring further clarity on this. Being\nreminded by Dr. Beavis that my cancer was \"extra-extensive\" was not pleasant to hear.\nBut she also reminded me that there are many treatment options for the recurrence that\nin most cases of ovarian cancer is likely. My vital signs are good (low blood pressure, as\nalways!) and her internal exam of me revealed nothing suspicious (a 'thickened' area in\nmy vagina that she was concerned about has healed, and there is no evidence of cancer\nin the area where my ovaries etc. used to be -- this is good news. Also no evidence of\ncancer in my liver, which she had been concerned about too: more good news. Finally, I\ncan stop taking one of my medications, another bit of good news.\nDr. Beavis and I also discussed whether or not I should take the PARP inhibitors as a\nmaintenance drug. She shared a very recent (Dec. 2019) _New England Journal of\nMedicine_ study that showed that for patients 'like me' (ie BRCA negative) the average\ngain in months before a recurrence was less than four months (for patients who are\nBRCA positive the gain is much more significant). Is it worth it for me to take these drugs\nand risk the side effects (fatigue - although it can be managed, high blood pressure,\naltered blood counts, and in a small number of cases, leukemia) to gain a few months\nbefore a recurrence?  On the other hand, if I have a recurrence soon will I regret not\nhaving chosen the more aggressive path? Tough decision, one that I will not make until\nafter the fistula issue is completely resolved.\nSo I expect to return to State College on Saturday sans stomach drain and hopefully sans\nfistula but with some unresolved questions. Perhaps I'll even know more tomorrow. I\ncontinue to feel like I am in expert hands medically.\nThank you, everyone, for your care and concern. My mother has, as usual, been stalwart\nand has maintained a positive attitude all along. We are going out shortly to a Lebanese\nrestaurant recommended by Dr. Beavis (who cleared me to drink in moderation!). I do\nlook forward to a nice glass of wine after a tiring day and before tomorrow's procedure. I\ndidn't sleep well last night because I was anxious, so I'm hoping tonight I'll fare better.",

    "entry": "My procedure - a drain plug closure of an enterocutaneous fistula -\nappears to have gone smoothly this morning. It took about an\nhour. The doctors, nurses, technicians and other staff at\nHopkins continue to be unfailingly skilled, kind, and highly\nprofessional. The small fistula had not closed on its own so Dr.\nHolly closed it. I will have a CT scan in about two weeks in\nState College to see whether the repair has 'held' (as\nmentioned, this procedure has about a 2/3 success rate). I was\nalso delighted to say good riddance to my 'appendage' - the\nstomach drain and drainage bag that I've needed to flush and\nclean twice a day and that have dangled from me for several\nmonths. Reinsertion of this tube, however, is not off the table\nif fluid begins to collect again in my stomach.\nFor every bit of good news - and there were certainly some to be\n                       300 / 1.901\nglad about on this visit - more questions, it seems. A second\nradiologist's report of my PET-CT scan confirmed the results of\nthe preliminary report: there are two 'suspicious' areas (one\nwhere my small and large intestines meet, the other in my lung)\nthat may or may not be cancerous. The CT scan in two weeks\nshould help clarify the situation. Dr. Holly (and Dr. Patel)\nbelieve the first area of concern, in the abdomen, is due to\ninflammation. We'll see. In the meantime, as my aunt Marlene\nwisely advised in response to my post yesterday, I will not\n\"borrow worries\" (as challenging as that might be). As she\nfurther noted, correctly: \"This is a tricky disease.\"\nIn what Dr. Beavis terms \"great news!!,\" though, my CA125 number\n(a marker for ovarian cancer) has dropped 50%, from 51 to 26,\nand is now in what she identifies as the \"normal\" range (as\nopposed to what Dr. Patel referred to as a \"worrisome\" range).\nWhile this is only one indicator for ovarian cancer, it's an\nimportant one, and my number has not been this low in months. So\na big yay for that.\nWhile I bounced back pretty quickly from the 'twilight' sedation\nI had administered for the procedure this morning (after which\nmy mother and I enjoyed a tasty lunch at a great local place,\nAtwater's), I'm feeling rather drained from the past few days\nand all the medical \"stuff.\" I am eager to get back to PA\ntomorrow and chill for a while before school starts on the 13th.\nI figure that I once again have a little 'reprieve' until my CT\nscan in a few weeks, during which time I can revel in feeling\n'normal.' Perhaps I have also exhausted (and/or bored) *you*\nwith these laborious descriptions of my medical condition, but\nit can become quite all-consuming. Thank you, as ever, for\nreading.",

I am grateful you take\nthe time to keep us in the loop, successes and uncertainties included. I'm so very happy\nthat stomach drain is gone and will pray you are among the 2/3 that see complete\nhealing from the fistula closure. Yay for less \"baggage\" in the New Year (pun:)!\nThanks too, to your Aunt Marlene, who reminded me of my dear Aunt Bea who would\ncaution us not to \"borrow trouble\". I repeat if often and appreciate the version of \"borrow\nworries\". I have written on the white board of my office a quote from Thich Nhat Hanh,\n                       304 / 1.901\n\"Worry is suffering twice\". I need that as a daily reminder.

Your words enable us to accompany you,\neven if at a distance, on your journey. We cheer with you, worry with with you, and\nremain optimistic and focused on life with you! I appreciate how exhausting it is for you\nto absorb all the details of you care. Sharing it with us is intimate and loving and I\u2019m sure\nthat we all are grateful to you for allowing us to be with you, as close as possible, thanks\nto precise, moving, and often very funny words! I just love how each of your reports\nseems to end with a good meal or an ice cream! I also admire you so much for going\nback into the classroom. Those lucky students!!

    "entry": "As if I didn't have enough on my hands medically, on Monday I fell in my house and\nchipped a bone in my ankle! I was having a pretty crummy day to begin with -- receiving\nan astronomical medical bill put me in a rotten mood -- when I got up from the chair I\nhad been sitting in for quite a while as I was working at my computer. No sooner had I\nextended my right foot than I found myself tumbling down onto the wood floor, winding\nup in a sort of contorted position with my right ankle and elbow and my left knee hitting\nthe floor, hard, and leaving me stunned. I surmise that the neuropathy (nerve damage)\nin my toes, a lasting side effect of chemo, made me lose my balance. I went to the\nurgent care clinic the next day, had my ankle and foot xrayed, and learned that I had an\navulsion fracture, a small fracture that can occur when a small fragment of bone chips\noff a larger one. I'm in an air cast, can walk (or rather hobble) and drive. Tomorrow\nmorning I'll go to the orthopedist, see if they need to put me in another cast (please, no\nplaster!) and learn how long this may take to heal. I've read that most often this type of\nfracture heals on its own. Please, no surgery!! I'm not in pain, and thank goodness I\n                       305 / 1.901\ndidn't hit my head or my side where I've just had a procedure last Friday. But the 'lesson\nto self' is that I need to be careful getting up if I've been sitting a long time because my\ntoes tend to feel numb by that point. Oy.\nSomehow this last incident has made me reach for black humor, instead of tears. I don't\nknow if this is healthier, but it just *is.* No pity party. The first image that came to mind\nwas that of the Black Knight in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ ,valiantly (or\nfoolishly??) continuing to fight his opponent despite having each of his limbs whacked off\nin succession (you must watch this iconic clip if you never have):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmInkxbvlCs\nNext, I began singing, as loudly as I could, Elton John's \"I'm Still Standing\" and then,\nperhaps more appropriately, Steven Sondheim's lyrics to \"I'm Still Here\" from _Follies,_\nwith several lines that rang particularly true to me:\nI've run the gamut, A to Z\nThree cheers and dammit, c'est la vie\nI got through all of last year\nAnd I'm here\nYou want to take my ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes? Go right ahead. A piece of my\ncolon? Why not. Gall bladder? No problem. And throw in my appendix while you're at it.\nI'm still here.\nThe word from my \"contemplation deck\" that's been staring at me the past few days is\n\"strength.\" Physically, I've certainly been stronger than I am currently (although my\nenergy and activity levels continue to be good); and I'm so disappointed that my plans to\nrestart a serious exercise program will now need to once again be on hold for a bit. But\n'strength' is also mental and psychic toughness. When the going gets tough, the tough\nget going. Maybe it's what the French call \"le moral,\" a psychological state that allows\none to confront difficulties and challenges. When I wrote to my editor in Paris, Corinne, to\nwish her a happy new year and update her on my health, she responded that she hoped\nI had \"le moral\" to get through this difficult period. She knows something about this. At\nmy last meeting with her, she was the one wearing the wig during her treatment for\nbreast and kidney cancer. Yet there she was at her desk in her office, reviewing captions\nfor the illustrations for my book, toughing it out. Later, over drinks at a cafe, she\nintroduced me to her partner, another cancer survivor, before the two of them sped off\non his motorcycle. Over a year later, she's still here.\nSo please no pity but good vibes welcome for my orthopedist appointment tomorrow and\nthen next Friday the 17th's follow up CT scan, bookending the first week of the semester\n                       306 / 1.901\nduring which I look forward to being in the office!",

    "entry": "Just a quick update for those of you kind enough to follow my travails. I am back from\nthe orthopedist, where I received some further clarification on what happened when I\nfell: basically, I sprained my ankle but when the ligaments pulled (which is the essence\nof a sprain), they chipped off one and likely two tiny (no long than 3 mm) fragments of\nbone from larger pieces on the right side of my foot and ankle. These should heal on\ntheir own; the bone won't regenerate (at least I don't think it will) nor will the fragments\nreattach to the bone; they simply get absorbed into tissue. No plaster cast necessary\n(yay) nor any surgery (yay). Instead, their orthotics guy fitted me with a boot that I need\nto wear as much as possible to immobilize my foot. The injury should heal in about a\nmonth max. I will be checked again in 2-3 weeks to see how things are progressing. I\nmight need some physical therapy after that to recover range of motion.\nThe boot is extremely unwieldy and heavy and not conducive to walking; I can drive if I\ntake it off. My first reaction when I saw it was: \"This thing is the antithesis of sexy.\" (\"I'm\n                       308 / 1.901\ntoo sexy for my boot, too sexy for my boot, too sexy woot woot?\"). I've tried my best to\nrock a bald head and no eyebrows, a port, and a torso length scar, but rocking this\nclunky thing is going to be a challenge. Moreover, because the boot sits on a raised\nplatform, I also received a matching platform thingy to affix to my left shoe, so that my\nhips and back don't get out of whack. Oy. To be honest, I feel like a bit of a hot mess\nright now but expect to be back to fighting form soon. I would be grateful for a rapid\nreturn to wholeness of body and no more mishaps. It certainly could be worse.",

    "entry": "Even after thirty-three years in my current job, I still get anxious before the first day of\nthe semester, and this one is no exception. I can tell, because I have not been sleeping\nwell for about a week. It takes me a long time to fall asleep because my thoughts are\ncareening out of control and once I do fall asleep, I doze lightly.\nSomething feels different this semester, though, and of course it is. I am not returning\nfrom a 'normal' leave but from a medical one and - without any exaggeration -- from a\nsometimes harrowing journey that feels a million miles removed from the bulk of my life\nexperience. It makes me think about -- without the slightest pretense *whatsoever* to\ncompare -- survivors returning from the camps, many of whose accounts I've read, and\nwhose feelings of alienation, of inability to communicate the hell they'd been through,\nwhose extreme difficulties reinserting themselves into their now foreign-seeming\nroutines, are palpable in their writings. I know this is a somewhat irrational fear on my\npart: I can't wait to see my colleagues, our office staff, and students, who I'm sure will\ngreet me with open arms and who have shown unfailing kindness towards me. While I'm\nnot teaching this semester, I'm really hoping I can be productive and helpful to my\n                       310 / 1.901\ndepartment -- there is some fear of feeling irrelevant. Yet I can't help feeling, too, that\nmy cancer has made me cross some invisible threshold, to a realm perhaps only (or\nbest) understood by those who have been there. So it's no wonder I can't sleep. I hope\nthese feelings will dissipate the further I delve into the semester.\nAnd of course I'm very anxious about my upcoming scan on Friday and praying that it\ndoes not reveal a recurrence. And if it does, what will that mean above all for my\nprognosis but also for my engagement with the semester that will have just gotten up\nand running? So....much...uncertainty. Don't borrow worries, don't borrow worries. For\nnow, I will simply look forward to an enjoyable and productive week ahead, doing what I\nlove.\nI'm still in my boot, likely for the next two weeks, but so be it. When I remove the boot\nand walk gingerly, I can tell that my foot/ankle are healing. It can't happen any more\nquickly.\nMy hair is starting to grow back and I look like a porcupine.\nThank you Maria, Clare and Lisa, Jackie, and Helen for the wonderful recent visits, gab\nfests, ramen soup and Mexican lunches, and yummy homemade beef stew! Thanks to\nthose friends who sent texts recently too. All very warming (and not just temperature-\nwise).",

Even if you are not teaching it is a huge step to go\nback among your students, colleagues, staff, but if you can do it physically it will be\nprobably good for the mind and heart.

I fully understand your feeling s about people coming back from the war, from\ncamps, how could they make family, friends, and strangers, comprehend what they went\nthrough. All is well for us, we are thinking of our time in Paris starting mid-May, but\nwondering if strikes will be over? It is truly a mess, people cannot travel in or away from\nthe city.

Everyone has been so kind.\nToday about six of my colleagues were crammed into one of our offices to enjoy lunch,\nlively convo and after lunch expresso.

    "entry": "I don't yet have an update to share about this morning's CT scan. I could barely sleep\ndue to anxiety, amplified by a text received from Penn State at 1 a.m. warning of icy\nroad conditions. The road in front of my house had not been plowed by 6 a.m., when I\nwoke up, so I took a cab to Geisinger (and an Uber back). I was there by 7:30 to ingest\nthe yucky drink over the next hour and a half, and then had the scan (I've had so many\nof them by this point that I'm an expert at submitting to them!). I was disappointed that\nGeisinger would not upload the images to the Hopkins image sharing website whose\naddress I gave them, for fear of viruses. This would have enabled my Hopkins doctors to\nread/view the images today. The nurse did say she sent the images to Hopkins via a\nprogram called Life Image but Dr. Beavis' nurse at Hopkins said she had no idea what\nthis is. Frustrating. In the end, I had to mail the disc containing the images via overnight\nexpress mail, with a tracking number. Further, the nurse told me that a Geisinger\nradiologist would likely not read and complete a report for up to a week! I'm hoping in\nthat case that the Hopkins radiologists will simply take the lead here. So I may not know\nanything for a few days. My right side (the 'troublesome' side) feels a bit sore, as\nmentioned, and is not getting better, so the sooner the images can be read the better.\nThere is not much else I can do while waiting, unless I really start to feel worse.\nMeanwhile, I will try to have a calm (and calming) weekend. As I'm tired and there are\nstill patchy spots on the road, I think I'll work at home this afternoon, with a quick\nWegman's run at some point to stock up for the next big snow, due -- tomorrow!

    "entry": "My apologies for the air waves going silent for the past several days, and thank you so\nmuch for your inquiries about the results of my CT scan. In what my mother rightly calls\n'disc-gate,' the disc I sent to Hopkins last Friday, immediately after my scan, and which\nwas supposed to arrive the next day, only reached Dr. Beavis' office TODAY, five days\nlater. Apparently, per USPS, it arrived in Baltimore yesterday but Dr. Beavis' office had\nno idea where it was to be retrieved. As mentioned, Geisinger in State College did not\nwant to upload the images electronically to Hopkins' website for fear of viruses. In the\nmeanwhile, I could have made several round trips to Baltimore to hand deliver the disc! I\nwas in my car headed to Geisinger on my lunch break today to pick up two new copies of\nthe disc (was not going to take any chances with just one copy), when Dr. Beavis' office\ncalled to let me know it had arrived. I will spare all the additional details that conspired\nto cause such an anxiety-provoking delay.\nI have no other news to report. I presume that I'll be contacted once Drs. Beavis and\nHolly have looked at and discussed the imaging. I am still quite anxious but being at\nwork has been a great diversion.\nAs if my day could not have started out any more tensely, as I was driving to work this\nmorning, having figured out my plan regarding the AWOL disc, what did I see in my rear\nview mirror but... a cop car with flashing lights. Oh my. I pulled over and got out my\nlicense, insurance and registration cards. Unfortunately, as I knew, I am overdue for my\nyearly inspection. I was scheduled for it last week but the fractured bone in my ankle\n(which is, incidentally, healing well) really put the kibosh on my walking the quarter mile\nor so from my garage to my office, so I cancelled the appointment. I do realize that I\nshould have taken care of this earlier and will make sure to get it done asap. The young\nofficer -- to whom I showed my big clunky boot as 'evidence' -- was very polite and gave\nme a citation, not a ticket -- but still. Not what I needed.",

    "entry": "320 / 1.901\nThere is some very good news and some less good news.\nThe very good, indeed excellent news, per Dr. Beavis in my phone conversation with her\ntoday about the results of my CT scan, is that there appears to be no recurrence of\ncancer; \"nothing alarming,\" she said, based on the Geisinger radiologist's report and her\nown viewing of the images (which the Hopkins radiologists have not yet looked at). The\n'suspicious' spot (pleural effusion) on my lung is, in fact, tiny and apparently not a cause\nfor concern; the other 'suspicious' area on my right side is due to inflammation and what\nI will discuss below. I was extremely worried that my cancer might have spread to my\nlung, which would of course be very serious. I was consumed with anxiety, imagining my\naggressive cancer cells running amok in my body. Since November, then, I have\napparently remained in the clear, with NED (no evidence of disease). Praise be.\nLess fortunately, fluid is still amassing on my right side, near my fistula. The procedure\nto close that fistula, which I had performed at Hopkins on Jan. 3, was not a success (in\npart due to the new fluid collection). This means that I still have a hole between my\nabdomen and my bowel, with the risk (small but still there) of sepsis, infection and other\nawful things. This leaves me with two options. I can have a new stomach drain placed\n(likely this week at Hopkins, and hopefully during the first part of the week as we have a\nseries of job candidates coming to campus beginning next Thursday); then, in four\nweeks, Dr. Holly can attempt the procedure again. Two weeks after that, as was the case\nthis time, I'll have another CT scan to see if the procedure was successful. My doctors\nseem to me pessimistic about the procedure working this time. It has a 2/3 success rate\nin the best of circumstances (ie no fluid collection), but given that it didn't work the first\ntime, my odds are likely slimmer, although not non-existent. Dr. Beavis said that it would\nprobably be like \"kicking the can\" down the road, with surgery likely eventually.\nHowever, it still might work and would also provide me with about 6-8 weeks of relative\n'normalcy' as I am just getting into a groove at work and with other aspects of my life.\nDr. Beavis understands how important these 'quality of life' issues can be (and are, for\nme). At the same time, she would like me to, in her words, \"have this whole episode\n[concerning the fistula and the fluid collection] behind me.\"\nI could also opt for surgery right away or, as mentioned, surgery if the procedure fails. I\nwill need to meet soon with the colorectal surgeon, Dr. Sandy Fang, but as I understand\nit, this surgery might be (partly?) laparoscopic or not; might involve removing another\npart of my colon or not; and might involve placing an ostomy bag *temporarily* or not. It\nwill depend on how things look inside, including the extent of adhesions etc. I will need\nto ask more questions about the surgery, including amount of recuperation necessary.\nBut it is likely that there's another surgery in my (not terribly distant) future.\nI am strongly leaning towards trying the procedure again both so I can attempt the less\ninvasive option first and so I can keep building on my newfound momentum at school\nand elsewhere.\n                       321 / 1.901\nI will need to (re)gird on patience and fortitude for the next hurdles, while hopefully not\nbacksliding out of the 'new normal' it's taken me so long to claw my way back into and\nwhere I am so very happy to find myself again.\nI am grateful that I was able to come down from my stress cloud over a nice glass of red,\nsome cheese and other nibbles, and calming and fun conversation with my friend Helen\nthis evening. I realize that I've been holding a lot of anxiety this week, much as I've been\ntrying to refocus my energies and attention elsewhere.\nMany thanks to everyone for the care and concern. With love,",

I hope to leave Hopkins on Thursday morning with clarity about the best path forward for\nme, ie second attempt at the fistula plug v. straight to surgery.

    "entry": "I am facing another major surgery before too long. This was what I came away with after\na two-night stay in Baltimore full of twists and turns, uncertainty, and stress, along with a\nbright spot or two.\n                       325 / 1.901\nTo begin at the beginning: on Wednesday morning I had an appointment with Sandy\nFang, a colorectal surgeon, to discuss surgery to repair or eradicate my the\nfistula/abscess/inflammation in my abdomen. I was at that point going with the idea that\nsurgery might be a second option, following a second attempt to plug the fistula\nlaparoscopically. Unfortunately, Dr. Fang was running about 45 minutes late, which in\nthe end left us only a rushed 30 minutes before I had to go to another building for my\nprocedure (stomach drain placement); watching the time slip away as I waited for her\nwas quite stressful, as I had driven 3.5 hours for this appointment. In the half hour we\nhad together, she began to explain what the surgery would entail, and she asked me\nsome questions and examined me. However, she stated that she would be fine with my\ntrying the less invasive fistula plug procedure first. She said it would be important to first\ndrain as much fluid as possible from the abscess, to create the 'cleanest' possible\nenvironment for possible surgery, so she was intent as I was on getting me to my next\nappointment on time. I tried to get a sense of possible timetable, length of recuperation\netc. but she wanted to first explain the operation to me. She kindly offered to meet with\nme again the following morning at 9:00, so we could have a more in-depth conversation\nand so she could answer my questions.\nI hustled over to the Zayed building to check in for my stomach drain placement. The\nvery nice nurse who had attended to me last time I was at Hopkins (earlier this month) --\nher name is Lisa  -- saw my name on the list of patients for the day and \"chose\" me. I felt\nhappy and relieved to see her again and we chatted about our kids, thoughts about\neventual retirement (we're about the same age), etc. as she placed an i.v. and started an\nantibiotic drip, covered me with warm blankets etc. Dr. Holly, the interventional\nradiologist who attempted to plug my fistula earlier this month, came by to say hello and\nto explain that he would be (re)inserting a stomach drainage bag in an attempt to reduce\ninflammation on my right side as a prelude to making a second attempt to plug the\nfistula in a few weeks. One of the fellows assisting Dr. Holly on the procedure also came\nby to introduce himself and to say \"we'll take good care of you.\" I continue to feel that,\noverall, I'm in excellent, skilled and compassionate hands at Hopkins. At around noon I\nwas wheeled into the procedure room (I remember looking up at the white ceiling while\nmachines whirred around me and thinking: \"Sometimes I still can't believe all this is\nhappening to me...\"). The fellow (I didn't catch his name) performed a sonogram to\nlocate the abscess into which the drain would be placed and he and Dr. Holly looked at\nthe screen together. Meanwhile, a nurse administered a sedative cocktail (Fentanyl and\nsomething else) that made me....very ...drowsy.\nI woke up disoriented back in the recovery bay. No drain. Dr. Holly came in shortly\nthereafter, looking slightly flustered, to explain that he had not been able  to perform the\nprocedure as the fluid collection was too small; this is not what Dr. Beavis had led me to\nbelieve from the CT scan, but I understand that once Dr. Holly and his team 'went in' to\nactually try to insert a tube into the abscess, it was a different story. There were three\n                       326 / 1.901\npuncture marks on my right side where the team had tried to access the abscess. Dr.\nHolly said something like: \"I'm sorry I wasn't able to do it. There's something else going\non here [>at the time that sounded ominous to me]. There's nothing more I can do for\nyou.\" Thus ended the possibility of option #1, ie stomach drain leaving only option #2:\nsurgery.\nSo it was back to Dr. Fang for the follow-up appointment the next morning. I was very\nglad that Dr. Beavis also joined us, as she happened to be free that morning.  We spent\nabout an hour together, with Dr. Fang explaining in detail (with the aid of a drawing and\nmy CT scan images, which had never really been shown to me with explanations before)\nwhat the surgery would entail. To my surprise (or was I simply in denial?), the surgery is\nmuch more of a big deal than I had imagined. It is major abdominal surgery. Urological\n(?) surgeons will first have to place stents in my ureters to make sure no urine seeps into\nthe abdomen. Then Dr. Beavis will need to see if there is any cancer for her to remove.\nThis gave me a sinking feeling. I was reminded that cancer under a certain dimension (1\nmm?) does not show up on a CT scan and that there was a bit of cancer she was unable\nto remove in May (but hopefully the chemo got it). Then Dr. Fang will remove the entire\n'problem' area (fistula, sinus tract, abscess). I will not be able to describe the procedure\nin as much technical detail as Dr. Fang did, but of course this involves complex issues\nregarding blood supply, adhesions, what she called 'tension' (of the tissue?), etc. Another\npiece of my colon and small intestine (I think) will be removed (following those removed\nlast May). Complications could arise if there is cancer in the area to be removed (will\nneed to review my notes on this); if cancer winds up being removed during the\noperation, it will likely be followed (once I recover) by more chemo. In the absolute worst\ncase scenario, I could wind up with a permanent ostomy bag; in better (less bad??)\nscenarios, I might have a temporary otsomy bag. Then there will be a hospital stay, like\nlast time, with the whole shebang (pain management for abdominal pain, goals to meet\nbefore I can be released, like eating without nausea or vomiting) and recuperation at\nhome, no driving for six weeks etc. Dr. Beavis implied that I might \"lose\" my spring to\nget back on track for summer and fall. Also, I can expect to lose 10-15% of my body\nweight because I won't feel like eating.  \nI don't yet know about timetable. I am now on antibiotics for two weeks to try to reduce\ninflammation before having another CT scan. My right side feels uncomfortable because\nof the inflammation, which Dr. Fang showed me on the CT scan, describing it as a 'rind.'\nIf the antibiotics seem to be effective, we'll probably wait a while longer before surgery.\nSo I'm in a holding pattern for at least two weeks and will be delighted to dive back into\nwork and my other activities during that time. \nOf course, I felt sort of numb receiving all this news and I'll need to write more about my\nreactions another time as I have to move on to other things soon. I felt somewhat\n'retraumatized' breaking the news to my family and feeling their distress (which I always\nfeel responsible for, even though I know that this whole cancer thing is just plain 'ole\n                       327 / 1.901\ndumb luck of the genetic draw...). What I need to keep in mind is a)as Dr. Beavis said,\nthe expectation is that this surgery will resolve once and for all this complication (she\nexplained what would happen if I didn't have it; infected fluid from the abscess would\neventually start seeping out of my skin.....) and b) I am in much better shape physically\nthan when I had my debulking surgery last May, when my body was full of cancer.\nThe brightest spot of the trip, and certainly not a negligible one, was having my dearest\n'people' with me. My brother's presence is so comforting. We had breakfast in the hotel\n(after he made a Starbucks run for us) and schmoozed about cars, Kobe and our kids. It\ndidn't matter that I was still a bit loopy from my sedation. And Wednesday night Ben\ncame from DC for dinner! Ben and his uncle Ethan are close, which is lovely to see. The\nthree of us went to a cute cafe in Fells Point called Water for Chocolate. I was so happy\nto hug and kiss my son. \"May you walk with good companions.\"\nMore before long. Must get ready for work!",

    "entry": "330 / 1.901\n                       331 / 1.901\nI was groomed for success. I was groomed to have it all. From my privileged private\nschool education in New York, which honed the intellect and confidence of young women\nbefore launching them to the top colleges and universities in the country, to Harvard, to\ngraduate school at NYU, where it was perhaps implicit -- for better or worse -- that I\nwould follow in my father's own successful academic career, to realizing that expectation\n(more modestly, but that's another story) over my thirty + years at Penn State, nothing\nseemed beyond reach. I cultivated my career with single-minded grit and determination\nbecause, as a Harvard friend highly impressive for her own career as a dean of a top\nbusiness school in Japan remarked to me in a text (as she was en route to the economic\nsummit in Davos), \"in our professions work is not just a job but life.\" Month-long trips to\nParis, other travel, frequent trips 'home' to New York or to see Ben in DC, pricey haircuts,\ncute clothes, and other forms of pampering were only a click of a credit card away. As for\nthe proverbial work-life balance, I've been blessed to be a mother (and have done pretty\nwell in that capacity, if I may). Marital/romantic relationships may have proved slightly\nmore challenging but certainly within reach, buttressed by many beautiful moments. \nAnd so this is why I was teary last night, as the debate in NH droned on in the\nbackground. Adjusting (lowering?) expectations is hard. 'Acceptance' is hard, even after\nsixty years of experiencing abundant privilege and opportunity that should be more than\nenough for one lifetime. Even gratitude for what remains is hard. I sit in my office,\noverjoyed to be back at work and grateful for the modified responsibilities this semester\nthat have allowed me to continue my recovery while working, yet sad that I'm not in the\nclassroom, as I normally would be. I'm depressed that I can't yet make plans to go to\nFrance (or anywhere) this summer as things are on hold until a timetable for my next\nsurgery is determined and while the specter of again losing a 'season' hangs over me.\nI know I will return to appreciating the 'new normal.' I know that gratitude for what is will\nagain flood my heart. I know that I'll again return to the conviction that giving up a trip is\na small price to pay for the hope of quality and quantity of life. But it's still hard.\nGod, grant me the serenity\nto accept the things I cannot change,\nthe courage to change the things I can,\nand the wisdom to know the difference.\nLiving one day at a time,\nenjoying one moment at a time,\nI am feeling ok overall. My sleep is so-so. I have discomfort on my right side, where the\nproblematic fistula/abscess are located. I am somewhat doubtful that the strong\nantibiotics I am taking to reduce the inflammation on my side are working. My CT scan\nthis coming Thursday will help determine the path forward medically. And here comes\n                       332 / 1.901\nthe scanxiety: will any new cancer show up on the CT scan? Is any lurking, eluding\ndetection? Damn this parasite that is lying in wait, destroying what I need to live.\nMeanwhile, my energy level has been really pretty high. I had a productive week at work,\nat the office from about 9:30 to 5 or 6 each day. It is such a pleasure to cram into my\ncolleague's office once or twice a week for lunch with one or more other colleagues (who\nare all friends) and dish about what we are reading for fun, our latest makeup purchases,\nour kids, and goings on in the department. I had a great convo over dinner with a job\ncandidate. Enjoyed another dinner and a lunch out with friends. Per tradition, taking my\nfriend Monique out for brunch tomorrow for our bdays (she's Feb. 4th, I'm March 4th) and\nthen going to see \"Parasite\" with Maria, as it's been highly recommended. Treated\nmyself to breakfast this morning at a cute cafe in town and enjoyed a hearty meal (eggs,\npancake, oj, cappuccino) while reading a magazine.\nHad a lovely day in Harrisburg last Sunday with a new friend, brunching at Rubicon in a\nsweet little townhouse, further relaxing over a coffee at Little Amps, right near the\nCapitol, then taking a stroll by the Suquehanna (see pic). Simple pleasures like getting to\nknow another person will always be wondrous to me. Resolutely seeking out and reveling\nin human connection has always been my m.o. But now it's also part of my f*** you to\ncancer. Yes, grateful for the moment.\n\u201cBecause I know that time is always time\nAnd place is always and only place\nAnd what is actual is actual only for one time\nAnd only for one place\nI rejoice that things are as they are and\nI renounce the blessed face and\nI renounce the voice\nBecause I cannot hope to turn again.\u201d\nT.S.

    "date": "February 15, 2020",
    "entry": "In the hall of fame (or notoriety) of tragicomic first encounters marking the flurry of\nonline dating into which I plunged post-divorce (now ten years ago!), there were some\nreal doozies (in all fairness, I must say that there were many lovely first dates too - some\nof you know who you are! :) -- and on the rare occasions I take a peek online these days\nI'm much more discriminating). Someday, maybe, I'll write about all these fellows, using\na title suggested by a friend who knows of what she speaks: Some College (this an\nallusion to an educational status that people may select for their profiles). There was (in\n                       337 / 1.901\nno particular order): Guy Obsessed with Disney; Anger Issues Guy; the Republican; Guy\nwho Accused me of being a Cougar; Nasty Basketball Coach; Guy who Declined to Spend\nthe Night, Citing a Flatulence Problem; and Guy who Refused to Date Women too Uptight\nto use Sh** and F** in the same Sentence (ok, I borrowed that last one from a friend).\nBut, when we tell the tales among girlfriends, the one that always elicits a stone cold\nsilence, followed by a muffled, embarrassed guffaw, is Guy who Died. Guy who Died was\na retired professor, perhaps in his 60s (or maybe 70s) at a local university (not Penn\nState), with whom I exchanged several pleasant enough emails. We agreed to meet for\ncoffee. Several days later, before we had even met, I opened my local newspaper, only\nto discover, in the Obituaries section, that my prospective date had died! No cause of\ndeath was cited, only information about the funeral, his next of kin, and a brief bio\n(incidentally, my experience echoes an episode of Sex and the City, in which Miranda is\nstood up for a date, only to find out that he has died of a heart attack, then only to\nattend the wake and see that the prospective date was very cute, and then only to pick\nup another guy at the wake). So maybe this is a.... thing?\nDid my Guy who Died pass suddenly, of a heart attack? Or rather did he know he was\nabout to die and, in the face of death, courageously cling to the hope of life and love, up\nuntil the end?\nI've thought a lot about him recently. In the fantasy I have spun around him (which may,\nI realize, contain a fair amount of projection on my part), he knew he was to die soon.\nWhile I hope and expect this is not my case, I too have found, when confronted up close\nand personal with at least the specter of death, as serious illness tends to do, a strong\ndesire (and ability) to love fiercely and purely and hopefully. As if the essence of life\ncould be distilled into love, which is timeless, and therefore, in some sense, a guarantee\nof life eternal. While Freud (about whom I\"m surely no expert...) wrote of the primal\nurges of Eros (the life urge, including libido and sexuality but also other forms of love)\nand Thanatos (the destructive urge) that exist in each person, I see them intertwined\ndifferently. \"Love never fails\" (1 Corinthians: 8), even -- especially - in the face or the\nwake of death.\nSo let's hear it for the Guy who Died. And let's be cheerleaders for love.\n****************************************\nSpeaking of love, I had a lovely Valentine's Day - bought myself roses and some eye\nshadow, and brought a box of chocolates from La Maison du Chocolat, sent to me by my\ndear, kind friend Paula, to work to share with a few friends.\nMy CT scan on Thursday went smoothly (although it's a tiring, all-morning ordeal) and I\nmanaged to upload the 600+ images to Hopkins' image-sharing site for the doctors to\nview. No word yet. I'm feeling a bit frustrated that Dr. Fang, the colorectal surgeon who\nordered the scan and who will likely perform the projected fistula operation along with\n                       338 / 1.901\nDr. Beavis, has not responded to my emails. While very friendly and while she spent a\ngood amount of time with me at Hopkins explaining the upcoming procedure and\nanswering all my questions, she also made it clear that she is deluged with emails and\nrequests for consults from all over the country... So I will need to be more proactive in\nmaking sure she remains responsive to me. Dr. Beavis is out of the country until this\ncoming week, so I'm presuming I'll hear from her then. I will see my medical oncologist\nhere, Dr. Patel, on Monday, so I can also share my concerns with him. Meanwhile, the\ndiscomfort in my side and abdomen is more or less manageable depending on the day\n(Ibuprofen helps) but clearly needs medical attention.\nI queried a few trusted friends about the need for such major abdominal surgery.\nHowever, this is a case in which it would be helpful for me to avail myself of a caregiver\nwho could do some research for me; I'm doing it all myself as I also work full time now\netc. So I'm doing the best I can -- but no pity party. My friend Marty, a scientist who\nteaches at Penn State and whose wife succumbed to ovarian cancer eight years after her\ndiagnosis, shared that Wendy had six operations but bounced back after each one to a\nvery good quality of life. My (ex)-bro-in-law, David, a gastroenterologist, said that\nsurgery seems a reasonable option at this point given that draining the abscess and the\nlaparoscopic procedure to plug the fistula both failed. He did reassure me, in the case\nthat I would need an ostomy bag (temporary or permanent), that many people have\nthem and that it winds up not being a big deal to them. This was quite reassuring. But a\npermanent bag would be worst case scenario only.\nI had a full week at work interviewing a visiting job candidate, working on projects for the\ndepartment, seeing a student or two, writing recommendations, meeting with the\ncurrent and former deans of our College, doing some research etc. and I held up well.\nStill very glad to be back at work, feeling productive and purposeful. Looking forward to\ntea this afternoon with my friend Clare and maybe our friend Lisa as well.",

    "entry": "As I was about to leave the office today to go meet my friend Helen for Mexican dinner at\nLupita's, my cell phone rang. It was Dr. Sandy Fang, the colorectal surgeon at Hopkins,\nwho had ordered the CT scan I had last Thursday and whose results I had been anxiously\nawaiting since then, all the while sending multiple emails via MyChart to make sure the\nimages had reached the right hands and been read by the right pairs of eyes.\nI am feeling more reassured now, not because anything has changed in terms of the\nneed for what Dr. Fang termed a \"big surgery\" but because a plan is now emerging. It's\nthe uncertainty that really unsettles me; yesterday afternoon, my therapist and I\ndiscussed to what extent my anxiety *might* be aggravating the significant abdominal\ndiscomfort I've been having recently, which I've been attributing exclusively to my\nfistula/abscess or else to *imagined* problems, such as new tumors pressing on my rib\ncage and into my abdomen, blockages etc. All these fantasies had been coalescing in my\nmind during what may be (in my analysis of the situation) a kind of retraumatization (a\nword?) I'm experiencing with the one-year anniversary of my diagnosis on the horizon\n(but not until April, in fact). After my discussion w/Dr. Fang, however, presto! my\nstomach somehow feels better, 'lighter.' Not all better, for sure, but just more ... at ease.\nDr. Fang told me that the new CT scan imaging has not significantly changed since my\nsecond to last CT scan two weeks prior. That was a relief, dispelling the fantasy of large\nnew tumors growing, blockages forming etc. She also said that she did not see any new\ncancer in the images - relief - but that she would let Dr. Beavis weigh in on that. She said\nthat people with my condition, ie with a fistula/abscess in the abdomen, often feel pretty\ncrappy - also somewhat of a relief as this explains why I've been feeling...pretty crappy.\nFinally, she reassured me of her competence/experience/expertise, as well as that of Dr.\nBeavis -- also a relief, as I had mistakenly thought I had heard her say during our last\nmeeting at Hopkins that she had not operated on a case exactly like mine. This turns out\nto not be true. She has performed many such surgeries, and many of them on cancer\npatients. She and Dr. Beavis often operate together. She assured me that she would take\n                       341 / 1.901\ngood care of me, although of course there are always risks with such a big surgery. But I\nplace my trust in these two very talented young women and the rest of the staff at\nHopkins.\nWe talked about projected dates for the surgery. It will depend on the coordination of Dr.\nBeavis' calendar w/Dr. Fang's (they are both very busy and in demand), but I was glad\nthat she asked me to weigh in too. I asked that she spare me from the knife on my\nbirthday (4 March), but suggested that the week of spring break (the week of March 9)\nmight be possible. After saying that, I wondered if I should try to preserve my spring\nbreak to take a week to relax and get a change of scene before surgery, but then\nwondered about my potential for relaxation under such circumstances. I guess the\nsooner I can have the surgery done the sooner I can start recovering, and since I'm on a\ngood roll with work I hope I'll be able to continue working at home while I recuperate. I\nguess there is no optimal time for the surgery. It also depends, Dr. Fang said, on how\nsymptomatic I am. As mentioned, my abdomen has been feeling uncomfortable but with\nthe plan in place I'm banking on it not feeling as bad, and I have a few nice events to\nlook forward to, beginning with Ben and Sammi being in State College this coming\nweekend. :)\nIt is still lovely to be at work. My colleagues are so kind, so pleasant. A few of us have\nbeen having lunch in one of our offices on MWFs, complete with a delicious espresso\nmade for us by the dear colleague, Heather, whose office we use for our gatherings. It's\nalways convivial and there are lots of laughs. I do miss teaching though. Good motivation\nto get better soon!",

    "entry": "A very pleasant and fun weekend lifted my spirits, as I await word regarding the date of\nmy surgery; I really hope to have this nailed down soon and will contact my Hopkins\ndoctors tomorrow.\nFriday I left work around 4 to grocery shop in anticipation of Ben and Sammi's arrival for\nthe weekend and a friend coming up from Baltimore for the day on Sunday. At Wegman's\nI ran into a friend I had not seen in several years who told me that shortly after he\nlearned about my diagnosis from a coworker, his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer\nand that he's had to hold down the fort (including caring for a two-year-old) while his\nwife has undergone treatment. He told me that he'd been following my CB page in order\nto know what to anticipate: chemo (in his wife's case overseen also by Dr. Patel, who\nseems to treat nearly every cancer patient in town), a trip to the 'wig lady,' etc. I am\nterribly sad for what he and his family are going through, but happy that my blog may\nhave provided some small measure of help. Cancer automatically creates bonds between\npeople - we're in the club no one wants to belong to, and we need to be there for each\n                       343 / 1.901\nother. My friend and I hugged warmly when saying goodbye.\nIt was of course really wonderful to have Ben and Sammi stay over both Friday and\nSaturday nights. Now that I subscribe to NYTimes recipes, I made an easy but very tasty\nbaked salmon dish, in a glaze with honey, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce and jalapenos,\nserved w/basmati rice and some sauteed spinach. After dinner we all went to the\nCreamery, where we laughed about ingesting so much sugar and cream that we were all\nthree nearly in shock! Clearly, my appetite is no longer failing me... On Saturday, I had to\nbe part of a 'ruse' to distract Michael while his house was being readied for his surprise\n60th bday party. So we chatted in my living room while Ben took an extra long time\nchanging light bulbs for me. After they left, I made a quiche with goat cheese and fresh\nherbs, some oat scones with cranberries and orange zest, and a beet salad. So glad to\nhave the energy for this major burst of binge cooking -- and I sent Ben back to DC\nw/homemade chicken soup too!\nLast night I went to a fun party for 'carnevale.' All the guests wore Carnival masks (some\nfrom Venice) and beads (mine, bought in New Orleans years ago, feature lobsters). We\nacted silly and danced up a storm! Again, I surprised myself w/my stamina. It felt so\ngood to enjoy some spirited partying, the kind I like (even sans alcohol for me...).\nToday a friend came up from Baltimore to spend part of the day with me. We had a\nlovely brunch that I had prepared, then went to the Palmer Museum, which we visited\npretty thoroughly, then sat outside in the sun at the Creamery, enjoying yet another ice\ncream cone. It felt like spring.\nMy hair has grown enough so that I think this week I will have it colored and trimmed. I\nimagine that this will feel quite liberating for me, eliminating the need to rely on a wig.\nIt's ultra short and I still look somewhat like a porcupine, but I will wear my new 'do'\nproudly.\nMy commitment card word this week (thank you again, Shanny, for this gift) is\n'positivity,' as in try to remain in this state. Very important.\nGrateful, then, for this weekend. Trying not to waste a minute. Anxious about backsliding\nbig time with the upcoming surgery (and praying that there will be no need for follow up\nchemo if any cancer is found during the surgery). I'll just have to try to get to a good\nspace mentally and emotionally, be patient and accepting, and keep of the goal summer\ntrips on the horizon.",

    "entry": "351 / 1.901\n                       352 / 1.901\nNote to self: never read emails in bed on waking up. That's how I found out, in an email\nfrom Dr. Fang, that my surgery has indeed been scheduled for Monday 9 March, which\nwas later confirmed when I spoke with Val, the nice administrator in her office. \nI don't know why -- or maybe I do -- but that news turned me into a slobbering weepy\nmess within minutes. I haven't cried so hard in a long time. I guess it's simply the 'feeling\nall the feelings' in a rush: guilt about again causing distress to my loved ones overtook\nme while I was sitting in my pjs at the dining room table, eating my scone; next came a\nkind of 'holy shit' fear and panic while I was showering (combined with a niggling feeling\nthat I should update my will before the operation); then huge feelings of disappointment,\nsadness and anger at the prospect of again needing to 'step out' of my normal life (yet\nwhat is normal for me anymore?) while the world goes on without me, all the while\ndesperately wishing I could simply be my usual vibrant, energetic, productive self; then\nsome confusion about how I should best use the time until the operation (likely simply\nhewing to my work/play routine, which suits me just fine). Then there is the\n'retraumatization' factor, as memories of physical pain, long recuperation, emotional and\npsychological fragility etc. came flooding back. It was so hard, and I just pray that my\nbody and spirit have the wherewithal to bounce back again.\nIt will be a big surgery. Per Val, the kind administrator at Hopkins, I will need to be at the\nhospital at 5:30 (!!) for a 7:30 operation, scheduled for 6+ hours. So maybe it won't be\nas long as that \"mother of all surgeries\" I had last May, but it will be long. Then a \"3+\nday\" hospital stay. In addition, I have to go to Hopkins this coming Monday for pre-op\nmeetings with the anesthesiologist and the ostomy nurse, in case that worse-case\nscenario becomes a reality. The night before the surgery I have to do a bowel prep (hope\nthis is not TMI), which was an absolute horror last May as I was very sick and had a hard\ntime with it. At least this time I know what to expect, will be in a much better/nicer hotel\nthan the one we were in last time, and will aim to be calmer. I know the drill.\nI am feeling rather frustrated that my surgeons have not seemed as responsive as I'd\nlike to my requests to speak with them before the operation. Dr. Beavis' nurse \"runs\ninterference\" for her and won't always forward notes from patients (at least from this\npatient). She (Kelly, the nurse) suggested that I really should be talking to Dr. Fang, the\ncolorectal surgeon. However, I would really like to speak with Dr. Beavis as the doctor\nwho oversees my care (and who will be present at the operation). I will need to regroup\nand try again.\nHold the presses! At the time of this writing, I have indeed spoken with the wonderful,\nupbeat Anna Beavis, who called me in my office at about 5 p.m., just as I was getting\nready to leave (and actually just as I was writing the previous paragraph). As usual, she\nspent as much time as I needed on the phone, answering all my questions. I took two\n                       353 / 1.901\npages of notes, and there's a lot of info to convey, so I'll just condense some of it here:\nas with my surgery last May, the type of surgery they will do will depend largely on what\nthey see when they 'go in.' She laid out three possible scenarios from best to middle-\nground to worst, all depending on a)whether or not they find any cancer in addition to\nthe fistula, b)where the cancer is located (if they find any), and c)how much they find.\nShe said my latest CT scan did not reveal any new tumors but, as I've mentioned, below\na certain size some cancer will not show up on the CT scan. What they find will also\ndetermine follow-up: if they find more cancer, I will likely need follow-up chemo. Dr.\nBeavis is also monitoring a small amount of fluid in my lung, which has gotten slightly\nlarger but is still very small. As I'll be pumped with fluids (I think), if it turns out they\nneed to drain any from my lung (at a later point), they may look at some samples under\na microscope, but during the surgery they'll only be operating on my abdominal area,\nnot my lung cavity. I asked her whether she thought this big surgery will inhibit my body\nfrom being able to deal with a recurrence if/when that happens and she said she\nbelieved it would *not,* as my body is overall stronger now than it was last May. She also\nis prescribing a painkiller to help ease my abdominal discomfort and to tide me over until\nthe surgery. She told me that she'd be assisting in the surgery from the 'ovarian cancer'\nperspective and also as someone who can convey what she understands of my\npreferences and wishes to Dr. Fang, ie as a type of 'advocate' for me. That made me feel\ngood.\nI know it's a lot to absorb. Somehow I am not feeling overly anxious now writing about it,\nperhaps because I felt better after my convo w/Dr. Beavis. She assured me that she'd\ntake good care of me. Dr. Fang had told me the same thing. I have to keep in mind that\nthe goal of this surgery is to permanently resolve this complication from last May's\nsurgery, so that I can get on with my life. Fingers crossed.\nI *did* manage to have a productive day at work today. The brightest spot was having\nthe president and secretary of the French club, two undergraduates, appear in my office\nto offer the faculty a King Cake (Gateaux des rois - sorry for the missing accent on the\n'a'), bought at Wegmans (!), to thank the department for providing some monetary and\nmoral support for the club's upcoming trip to New Orleans over spring break. They were\nterrifically sweet to make this gesture. I had totally forgotten that today is Mardi Gras.\nLaissez les bons temps rouler \ufffd\ufffd \nMy mother nicely assured me that Team Willa would be in place for the next hurdle. My\nfriend Lisa sat with me in my office in the late afternoon and kindly indulged another\nbout of teariness. I am so appreciative of everyone's well wishes and prayers. Thank you!",

    "entry": "Hi everyone,\nGreetings from the ER of MNMC (Mount Nittany Medical Center), where I've been laid up\nsince about ten or so this morning. My abdominal discomfort, coupled with some nausea\nand constipation, had been worsening over the past 2-3 days, culminating in a bad night\nlast night. The discomfort -- actually pain by this point -- was pretty acute: my abdomen\nfelt as if it were cramping or throbbing, I was burping a lot and felt on the verge of\nvomiting. The pain kept waking me up, and of course I was becoming progressively more\nanxious.\nSo I got out of bed at about 6 a.m. and wrote to both Dr. Fang and Dr. Beavis, describing\nmy symptoms and asking for their advice. Dr. Fang responded quite quickly, advising\nthat I go to the ER for blood work and a CT scan. I was able to drive myself to the\nhospital but was really not feeling well. Fortunately, I did not have to wait long to be\nchecked in.\nI'm being well taken care of here, by both a good ER doc, Eric Feese, and a\ncompassionate nurse, Carla (I don't know her last name). I had blood drawn to test\nkidney function among other things, had a chest x-ray taken as well as an abdominal CT\nscan. I've been receiving IV fluids (although I've had nothing to eat nor drink, per\ndoctor's orders) and some magnesium (as my level was low) by IV too. And I've been\nblissed out on morphine all day.\nThe CT scan revealed that I have an obstruction in my small bowel. It's not large, but\nlarge enough to be causing the pain that I experienced last night. It may be due to scar\ntissue, of which much formed after my operation last May. It may resolve on its own, or it\nmay need to be resolved surgically. Right now, I have an NG tube running through my\nnose into my stomach to drain what's above the blockage. Inserting it was painful, and\nbrought back memories of a host of painful procedures I had to undergo last spring. \n                       356 / 1.901\nDr. Feese spoke with Dr. Fang, who would like me to come to Hopkins for treatment. At 6\np.m. I'll find out whether they have a bed for me there (currently they do not). If so, I'll\nbe transported there by EMS ambulance (I do have my car here at the hospital and\nasked if I could drive myself to Baltimore as I think the transport is expensive, but the\ndoctor said no way). If a bed doesn't open up today, we'll try again tomorrow. I don't\nreally know what the plan is, but it sounds like it will entail fixing all the problems at once\n(blockage, abscess, fistula etc.). I don't know whether the date for that surgery will be\nmoved up to earlier than the currently scheduled one on 9 March.\nI'm not sure how I am feeling emotionally about these latest developments. I am much\nless weepy than yesterday. In fact, I feel pretty calm right now (the morphine helps...),\nrelieved to be taken care of and to know why I felt so wretched during the night. I'm just\nrolling with it for now. As ever, a lovely, loving and supportive email from a friend, which\nit looks like she sent at about 5 this morning and which I was thus able to read when I\nrose at 6, was a balm to my spirit. Emails, texts and calls throughout the day from a few\nfriends and of course the family members I was able to update (my mother, brother, Ben\nand Michael) also helped settle me. But the whole thing is really a drag....\nI will share updates when I can. Pleased that I thought to grab my laptop before I left this\nmorning, as well as a long novel that I'm engrossed in, but I don't have too much else\nwith me and have no idea how long I may be away. Thanks to everyone who took the\ntime to read this entry. I appreciate your well wishes and prayers.",

    "entry": "At least a brief update here as I'm feeling pretty crappy - have had a headache for two\ndays as I've been NPO (no food or drink, nor for the foreseeable future), feel nauseous,\nexhausted (arrived at Hopkins by EMT ambulance around 3:30 this morning) and still\nhave an NG tube down my nose. On the brighter side, I have less abdominal pain as\nthey've been draining my stomach.\nI am being very well taken care of here, naturally. I'm in a nice recently renovated room\nin the historic part of the hospital, on a floor where Saudi princes stay (along with their\nsecurity) when they come to be treated here. I saw Dr. Fang this morning and Dr. Beavis\nstopped by to chat for quite a while. They will be monitoring me over next few days to\nsee if the stomach blockage resolves, which is the hope (a good sign is that I have been\nable to pass some gas - again, hopefully not TMI here). My big surgery is still set for 9\nMarch, unless it needs to be done sooner in light of the blockage (Dr. Beavis noted that\nthings are rarely straightforward with my case...).So it's really day by day at this point.\nNo eating or drinking for now, and the tube will stay in my nose into my stomach.\nTomorrow they'll do a test w/contrast dye to see how things are passing through my\nsystem.\nA few bright spots through the gloom: chatting w/Dr. Beavis, 90% about my treatment\nplan but 10% about other stuff, including how she met her husband, her recent biking\nvacation in Colombia etc. She's a rock star in every way. Then a visit from Rhonda, the\nwonderful chaplain (Methodist, but quite ecumenical) who I met after my first operation.\nI also just love talking with her (and hearing her southern accent) and while we didn't\nhave time to pray today (as a phone call interrupted that), she will come visit me\ntomorrow for some prayers of healing. Finally, my beautiful son and I chatted for a while\nby phone; he'll kindly come from DC at some point this weekend to visit. As we\nunderstand that my upcoming bday (4 March) *may* be spent in decidedly unfestive\nconditions, Ben consented to this year 'share' his birthday, exactly one month after mine\non 4 April, with me! And it's truly a \"birth day\" for both of us.\nThanks, dear ones, for keeping me in your thoughts and prayers during this journey. \n  \n                       360 / 1.901",

    "entry": "363 / 1.901\n                       364 / 1.901\nDespite a three-day headache that I can't seem to shake, I wanted to write a brief\nupdate. This morning began with the possibility that I might have to have my big surgery\n*today:* Dr. Fang was afraid that the situation with the blockage might be degrading and\nwas also concerned about my own stamina waning having now been three days NPO\n(nothing through the mouth, and with an NG tube still draining my stomach). However,\nshe said the upper GI test would determine the next steps. At that point, I texted my\nbrother the news and he and my mother were kind enough to get on the next train from\nNY, arriving here around 2:00 p.m.\nI had the upper GI test at 10:00 a.m.; it involved running a barium contrast dye through\nmy NG tube and then taking pictures at half-hour intervals to assess the progression of\nthe liquid through my digestive system. I couldn't hold the barium down at first, so we\nhad to start over. To my surprise, the test went more quickly than I expected (I was told\nto bring a book as I might be there for several hours) and the radiologist then came to\ntell me that the liquid had progressed quickly to the colon and that in fact the\nobstruction seemed to be resolving!\nSo back to my room. Dr. Fang came by again to confirm this news and put forth a\nrevised plan. I will likely be here through Sunday or Monday, giving the obstruction\nfurther time to resolve (although things can always change). Hopefully, the NG tube will\nbe removed tomorrow and I can begin receiving non-IV nourishment very slowly\n(probably just a few sips of water at first). In order to be discharged, I will need to be\nmeeting certain benchmarks, which I already seem to be doing. If all advances as\nplanned, I'll be able to return to State College and regain some strength next week\nbefore coming back to Baltimore next Sunday the 8th for the big fistula repair surgery on\nthe 9th.\nI'm feeling pretty weak and, as mentioned, have had a non-stop headache, some\nnausea, fatigue etc. but my abdomen feels less painful, which is a good thing. I continue\nto have nothing but the highest praise for the doctors, nurses, technicians etc. at\nHopkins. Today I was cared for by a very sweet nurse named Kiki, who declared me\n(based on my telling her that I teach French and her seeing a pretty amethyst and topaz\nring on my finger) \"the cutsiest, classiest, boutique-y lady.\" I'll take it, especially as that's\nhardly how I I feel today :) Then there was \"Mr. G\" (\"Hi, Mr. G!,\" as the nurses greet him),\na dignified looking older gentleman who came to collect the trash in my room, which he\nlooks like he may have been doing since the Nixon (?) presidency. Many cheers for the\ngood, decent, dignified working people of Baltimore. \nIt was comforting to have my mother and brother here. Ethan has to return to NY\ntomorrow but my mother will stay on, and Ben will come from DC after a certification\ntest he has to take for work, perhaps spending the night if he can.\n                       365 / 1.901\nI am so very grateful for everyone's texts, emails, comments on CB. I did not have the\nstamina today to respond to individual messages, but I'll try to get to them when I'm\nfeeling up to it.\nWith my very last iota of energy last night (see pic), I helped the grad student whose\ndissertation I'm directing work through a final draft of her grant proposal, due today.

    "entry": "Foods I am craving right now: mole, Szechuan noodles, spaghetti and meatballs with a\nton of grated cheese, bananas Foster bread pudding from Magnolia Bakery in New York.\nMaybe a cheeseburger and French fries. And a NY bagel with veggie cream cheese. In no\nparticular order. Or maybe all at once.\nFoods I have eaten today (60 mls per hour): veggie broth, red jello, mango and cherry\nices, cranberry juice. \nAfter going on four days without eating and with a little imagination, the latter foods\ntasted almost as good as the former! Almost.\nI am coming along well. The residents doing rounds this morning examined me and said\nmy stomach felt much softer, which is a good sign. The female resident told me her\ndaughter's name is Zahava! In the late morning they did a study (I forgot what it's\ncalled) to see how well liquids were flowing through my digestive system; it involved no\nlonger relying on suction. The study was to last for four hours. However, at about the two\nhour mark while I was changing into a fresh gown, I sneezed forcefully several times and\nwound up *sneezing out* my NG tube, the one going through my nose into my stomach!\nWe were all very surprised and couldn't figure out where the tube had gone. Thankfully, I\nwas spared the agony of having the tube reinserted as it was clear that the study was\ngoing well, ie there was very little gastric discharge in the canister. So the study was\nstopped and at that point I was put on clear liquids in small doses. This has had the\nadvantage of making my blazing headache abate and giving me a bit more energy (my\nmother and I walked all around the three floors of this pavilion today as my walking is in\nno way inhibited and I normally have plenty of energy for walking long distances).\nThe resident and I discussed the timetable for my discharge. Presuming I continue to\nprogress, I may be released either tomorrow afternoon/evening or Monday morning,\nwhen I must get to two pre-op appointments for the surgery on the 9th. So fingers\ncrossed that I can return to State College on Monday, and enjoy a few days of normalcy\nat work and with friends, and hopefully a pleasant birthday, before returning to\nBaltimore next Sunday.\nMy brother had to return to NY but it was wonderful to have my mother and Ben here.\nThey went off to dinner (and tempted me with pictures of what they ate), but will be\nback in the morning before Ben has to return to DC.\n                       368 / 1.901\nI am already impatient for my upcoming surgery to be over and done with so I can get on\nwith my life, although I know that I'm in for a longish recuperation. Ugh. But I'm already\nsetting some goals for myself. One will be to participate in a 5K/1 mile \"Stride and\nThrive\" run/walk to raise $$ for gynecological cancer research/awareness at Johns\nHopkins on 7 June. Ben and I were getting excited about putting a team together. Let us\nknow if you'd like to join us. A second will be to get to Paris at some point over the\nsummer. And the third will be to make it to a close friend's wedding in July. #goals.\nA very sweet nurse, Kaitlynn, just came in to tell me that I've been 'advanced' to\n*unlimited* clear liquids - woohoo! To celebrate, she is bringing me another mango ice,\nof which I'll probably eat half, having promised not to 'chug' any of my liquids!",

I slept relatively well, ie in\nthree solid 'chunks' of 2-3 hours each, interrupted by technicians coming to my room to\ntake vitals. My obstruction has continued to resolve, allowing me to 'graduate' to a full\nliquid diet at lunch (cream of tomato soup, chocolate ice cream) and a full low-fiber diet\nfor dinner (cheese omelet, mashed potatoes). My very dear son returned to spend a bit\nmore time with me this morning; we walked around the hospital, very quiet today. The\nsky looked the color of early spring and I felt sad not to be out in it. But I see mild\ntemperatures predicted for this week.\nAnd I am going home tomorrow! I will be discharged in the early morning after the\ndoctors round and examine me, then get ready to go to two pre-op appointments in\nanother part of the hospital, then have some lunch and head back to State College,\nhopefully to arrive by the end of the afternoon. My mother will kindly stay with me until I\ntake off, before catching her train back to New York. A number of friends are very\ngenerously retrieving my car at the hospital, bringing me some homemade beef broth\nand a few groceries.\nThe night (or rather early morning, c. 3:30 a.m.) I arrived at Hopkins as well as last night,\nI had the sweetest nurse, Kaitlynn. The nurses here are all wonderful and highly skilled.\nKaitlynn, all of twenty-four years old and who addressed me as \"sweetie\" and \"hon\" (this\nlast one a Baltimore thing, I think) left me the loveliest note on my white board this\nmorning (see pic). I hope she'll get to take care of me during my next stay here.\nI hope my recent spate of written 'logorrhea' has not been off-putting, too 'TMI.'\nSomehow, the words just keep tumbling out. This has had unexpectedly fortuitous\nconsequences for my academic writing: last week when I was working on a scholarly\narticle the writing came much more easily and fluidly than it normally does. The Caring\nBridge writing seems to me both a way of helping me articulate my emotions and at the\nsame time of keeping them in check, giving cogent shape to a flood of feeling that might\n'come out' other ways if not channeled here.

    "entry": "373 / 1.901\n                       374 / 1.901\nI am overjoyed to be home. The day began early (the doctors rounded at 6:15), with a\nfew snafus, but fortunately nothing health-related nor serious. I spent about an hour\nlooking for my shoes, having convinced myself both that I had left them in the\nemergency room in State College and that I'd have to return home shoeless, wearing\nonly hospital socks. A random last-minute look under the bed uncovered my shoes. More\naggravatingly, around 8:15 I was wheeled about 15 minutes across the hospital to my\npre-op appointments, only to discover that I couldn't have the appointments without\nhaving first been discharged. So all the way back across the hospital, only to find out\nthat, in the end, a)the ostomy nurse who was supposed to 'mark' me is out of the office\nthis week (!) and b)the anesthesiologists, having reviewed my EKG and other results,\ndetermined that they didn't need to see me. Ouf. I suppose this means that I might have\nbeen discharged last night... So I went to the pharmacy to pick up all the stuff required\nfor the prep I need to do Sunday for Monday's operation, then stopped at the cafeteria to\npick up some lunch (which thankfully sat well with me), then back up to the room to get\nmy bag and hug the very friendly, upbeat and savvy nurse, Rachel, who had helped take\ncare of me during my stay. My mother was kind enough to stay with me until the very\nend, when we parted ways at the hospital entrance -- she Ubering to the station to get\nher train back to NY and me waiting for the car service that takes me back and forth\nwhen I don't have my own car with me and/or can't drive. I was so happy to take in big\ngulps of fresh air in what felt like very early spring weather while awaiting my ride.\nWanted to add here that I'm feeling so much better than when I went to the emergency\nroom early last week. My abdomen is much less bloated, I'm having much less\ndiscomfort and nausea. The Hopkins team knew what to do - some of it involved\nbasically starving me for four days. :)\nThe driver, Mohindr (who is my buddy now) and who is quite solicitous (he's praying for\nme) and responsible (transporting me in a comfy, roomy, clean SUV), had brought along\nhis wife, Kashmir, to keep him company. They look to be in their 50s (?) and are very\nsweet. He operates out of the Virginia suburbs and apparently drives several politicians,\nprominent clergy at the National Cathedral etc. Kashmir gave me some tips for making\nIndian rice pudding (like using a slow cooker, and throwing in a cinnamon stick). I\nconvinced them to make a detour for me so we could stop at Alvaro's, the phenomenal\nold-style Italian bakery in Harrisburg that is usually my pit stop when I travel between SC\nand DC or Baltimore. I bought two pounds of yummy Italian cookies for the bday potluck\nlunch we are having at work on Wednesday. Mohindr and Kashmir bought cookies too,\nand Italian bread. They took a picture of me with my 'stash' (see pic), which also\nincluded a small portion of tiramisu gelato for me (so good...). Then Mohindr insisted we\ntake some selfies, apparently happy that I had proposed making the trip into a bit of an\nadventure. It's been a wild and crazy ride all along, let me tell 'ya.\n                       375 / 1.901\nI forgot to mention that, while en route back to State College, Dr. Beavis called me.\nMohindr was nice enough to pull over to reduce traffic noise, but it meant that we were\nsort of precariously camped out on a narrow highway shoulder. Dr. Beavis was very\ntouched and grateful that, thanks to the generosity of my friends (meaning here: the\nones on Facebook), I was able to direct a significant amount of $$ towards ovarian\ncancer research/awareness programs at Hopkins, in Dr. Beavis' honor, timed as a\nfundraiser on the occasion of my upcoming birthday (btw: if anyone else is interested in\ndonating, you can do so here: https://secure.jhu.edu/form/obgyn.\nYou might donate in Dr. Beavis' honor to the Susan Burgert Survivorship Program, which\nis on the drop down menu). In any event, Dr. Beavis had come to see me in my room\ntoday, but I had already left. We talked a bit more about the upcoming surgery. To\nprepare myself psychologically, I tried to get more of a sense of how 'big' it will be in\ncomparison to my debulking surgery last May. As I knew, this is major abdominal\nsurgery. If I do have to have an ostomy, temporarily or permanently, that will be a new\nelement to adjust to and thus a new part of my recovery. But she stressed again that I'm\nin better health than last May. Of course, if they uncover new cancer a new plan will\nneed to be put in place. She thought my hospital stay might be 5-7 days, which would be\n*way* more manageable than the three-week stay last time, due to complications\n(abdominal infection) that were already starting to develop then and that have\nnecessitated surgery now. I told her how strongly (underscore that many times)\nmotivated I am to recover asap in order to get on with my life. \nI look forward to enjoying every minute of the next five days here and to trying not to\nthink too much about the next hurdle. Many thanks to my friends Maria for having some\ngroceries waiting on my return, to Monique, for bringing copious amounts of one of her\ndelicious, restorative broths and to Deb and Tony for retrieving my car at the hospital\n(and the beautiful springlike flowers) -- and needless to say to my mother, Sharon,\nbrother Ethan and Ben for being by my side in the hospital. So so grateful for all the\ntexts, emails, FB messages of support, love and good cheer from friends and family old\nand new. Thanks for travelling this road with me.\nBig love to all.",

    "entry": "377 / 1.901\n                       378 / 1.901\nI had a wonderful birthday. I always have trouble sleeping the night before, out of\nexcitement. I've always been a 'birthday girl.'\nOver breakfast I opened a number of cards and gifts that had been accumulating the\npast few days, all of which made me smile with happiness and gratitude. I also started\nchecking Facebook (where the first bday greetings were coming in from France, six\nhours ahead), as well as my texts, emails etc. While I have an ambivalent relationship\nwith social media, I love how on birthdays all these means of communication help\nproduce a splendid chorus of good cheer.\nI got dressed to the 1978 song by one-hit wonder Patrick Hernandez, \"Born to be Alive,\"\nwho anyone who lived through the disco era with me should remember. The pulsating,\nslightly manic mood of that song somehow seemed right for the day. I blared the music\nand sung the lyrics at the top of my lungs: \"It's good to be alive...be alive...be alive. It's\ngood to be aliiiivvvve!\"\nThen I set off for J. Stephens Salon, where my long time hair stylist, Sarah, colored my\n*very short* hair (I have not had hair this short since I was an infant), which Chelsey then\ncut for me. I had been anticipating this visit as a kind of 'watershed moment,' when I\nwould ditch my wig and begin 'living my truth' (except for the illusion of my hair still\nbeing dark brown!). While I was initially unsure how I felt about the look, which is\ndramatically different for me, I believe I am growing into it, even embracing it, even\nrocking it! The response from friends and family has been positive and affirming, with\ncomparisons to French theorist/intellectual H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixious, singer Anne Lennox, and the\ncomposer Laurie Anderson. My look has been variously described as 'cool,' 'edgy,' 'chic'\nand 'sophisticated.' I like that my earrings now become a prominent accessory, dangling\nfrom my super-visible ears, and that a bit of extra makeup adds to the dramatic overall\neffect. Needless to say, all of this will go down the drain if I have to have more chemo\nbut until that happens (if it does) I am enjoying my new 'do.'\nNext I headed to school for a potluck bday lunch. As several of my colleagues and I have\ntaken to lunching together informally 2-3 times a week, we decided to do something\nslightly more ambitious yesterday. About eight of us (including two of my former\ncolleagues, now retired, who nicely showed up) gathered to enjoy a salmon quiche,\nsushi, a pissaladi\u00e8re (a classic dish of Provence featuring caramelized onions, anchovies\nand olives), salad and more. I brought Italian cookies from Alvaro's in Harrisburg, a cake\nand chocolates. Every time a new person walked into the seminar room (where we had\nlunch), everyone recommenced singing \"Happy Birthday\" to me in English or French. It\nfelt like Groundhog Day -hilarious. I probably went slightly off the rails in terms of my\nfood consumption - I avoided items like nuts that I knew would not sit well given my\nrecent abdominal troubles, but it was hard to resist having seconds of some of the other\n                       379 / 1.901\ntreats (the cookies were my downfall).\nThen it was time to get ready for a departmental faculty meeting and to take care of\nsome other work tasks. \nAfter work I gathered about ten friends for drinks and snacks at Barrel 21, a local\ndistillery. My Hopkins doctors had authorized one cocktail (I have not been drinking\nbecause of a very potent antibiotic prescribed to me, but I was able to stop taking it a\nfew days ago). I treated myself to a stiff Manhattan with the good Bourbon B21 distills,\nand thoroughly enjoyed it. I also had a burger, hold the bacon. It was a very merry\ngathering of friends in different departments/units (French, Spanish, Italian, English,\nGerman, Music and the Penn State Press). The group reprised the by now absurd\nrepeated singings of \"Happy Birthday.\" So much fun.\nAn avalanche of FB messages, texts, emails, cards, phone calls, gifts and donations to\nHopkins left me feeling overwhelmed by the end of the day, overwhelmed by kindness.\nMy mother's card features a series of bright drawings of the sun, accompanied by the\nmessage \"There's a light inside you and every year it just gets brighter\" - thank you,\nmom. :) In a humorous vein, my friend Shanny sent a card featuring a drawing of a\nbeautiful princess or noblewoman looking radiant and enraptured in a bright yellow gown\nas she seems to 'glide' in front of a medieval castle while a lord and lady look on, with\nthe caption \"The anti-depressants seem to be working.\" Yesss.... Everyone who reached\nout to me showed such thoughtfulness in their words and deeds... I am one lucky girl.\nMy birthday was a real 'high.' In fact, I've felt a bit 'heightened' since I've been back from\nthe hospital, especially knowing what's on the horizon early next week. Hoping that an\nequally forceful 'crash' does not ensue... But between now and Sunday, living well will be\nmy best revenge...\nPS: I hope to personally thank many of you in writing, but it may take me just a little\nwhile. \nPhotos\n                       380 / 1.901\n                       381 / 1.901",

    "entry": "I left home around 8:30 on this beautiful, sunny, springlike morning and was in Baltimore\nbefore noon; I drove myself this time. I was going to leave later but last night I realized --\nguess I hadn't read the fine print-- that I had to start my bowel prep by noon, and for that\nI needed to be well installed near a bathroom. So I had to make a supermarket run at\nabout 7:30 last night to pick up some jello, chicken bouillon, and Gatorade to ingest\ntoday as part of my clear liquid diet. Ugh.\nI slept pretty well last night, although with the 'spring forward' it was still dark when I\nawoke at 7:00. The previous two or three nights, though, had been plagued by insomnia,\nas I started to feel very anxious about tomorrow's surgery. An avalanche of 'what ifs'\nswirled through my mind: what if Dr. Beavis finds more cancer? and what if that means\nI've reached a more advanced stage (ie IV instead of III)? what if I experience\ntremendous pain in my abdomen/diaphragm, as I did last time? what if I wake up with an\nostomy pouch? what if there are complications during surgery? what is my body has\ntrouble handling the rigors of this surgery? what if it takes me a really long time to\nrecuperate? Staying busy at work this past week kept some of these anxieties at bay,\nbut they reemerged at night.\nThe pre-op prep is going more smoothly than last May, when I was so sick and anxious I\ncouldn't keep anything down and we all (my mother, Ethan and Ben) had a frightful\nnight. This time, I'm in a nicer, more comfortable hotel (the hotel in May was in a sketchy\n                       382 / 1.901\nneighborhood, adding to the stress), Ben is in DC until tomorrow (I told him that there\nwas no reason for him to come today, as my mother and Ethan are here), and I rested a\nbit each hour after taking whatever was prescribed for that time (Miralax mixture, or\nantibiotics, or laxative pills, or additional fluids etc.). If you've done this before, you know\nit is not at all pleasant, but at least I'm feeling comfortable and as relaxed as I can be. I\nhave to wake up at about 4:30 to get the hospital at 5:30 (surgery's at 7:30) but I might\nchill out until 10 by watching my guilty pleasure, \"90 Day Fiance.\" Gotta have my junk\nt.v.\nIt was lovely to enjoy two final 'normal' outings this weekend before my surgery\ntomorrow. My friend Helen and I gabbed for a few hours over dinner Friday night at Gigi's\n- much fun. Yesterday, my friend Clare and I drove to Tait Farm where a demo about\ncreating cute little teacup 'gardens' for succulent plants was taking place. We did some\nshopping there, said 'woof' to the adorable Basset hounds they breed there, then went to\nhave tea at the Pump Station Cafe in Boalsburg. If felt so good to sit outside, sunning our\nfaces and chatting. My fervent wish is to return to all of this asap. It's the little things...\nBut for now I'll be slipping into the arms of Morpheus and entrusting Drs. Fang and\nBeavis with my body (and life...) as they work to heal me. If this surgery resolves the\nhost of abdominal issues that have been pestering me since last May, and if I can back\non track before long, it will have been worth it.\nAs always, thanks so much for recent texts and emails (I still haven't responded to all the\nbirthday messages I received!). I'm too worn out to respond to them now, but hopefully\nI'll be able to from the hospital as I recuperate. I've given my brother 'co-authorship'\nrights to my Caring Bridge. I expect he'll provide an update once I'm out of surgery.\nLove and hugs,",

Reflecting quietly, as I sit\non the train back to NYC, the mood doesn\u2019t feel as frantic and urgent as May 2019. The\nreason - she\u2019s making great progress towards fighting this disease and reclaiming her\nfulfilling life. Willa has once again shown tremendous grit, as she recuperates from\nanother major abdominal surgery. While it was not the M.O.A.S. of \u201819, it was\nnonetheless excruciatingly painful and taxing. She has begun to strive for and achieve\nnecessary benchmarks towards her recovery and discharge. Just this morning, we took a\nwalk down the corrider of Marburg 2, her third such stroll in 2 days. These walks, and the\nall day prodding are exhausting. She thanks you all for the outpouring of notes, texts,\nand hearts, and will surely be back in touch with you once she is at full strength. She is\nbeing very well cared for, and we cannot thank the team at Johns Hopkins enough for\ntheir unwavering love, support and expertise. \nRegards, Ethan\nFeel free to contact me at either emanproductions@nyc.rr.com/917-687-2978, should\n                       388 / 1.901\nyou have any further questions or need me to pass anything along to Willa.\nSent from CaringBridge iPhone app",

    "entry": "391 / 1.901\n                       392 / 1.901\nAppreciative thanks again to my brother, Ethan, and son, Ben, for posting for me the\npast few days as I didn't feel up to it. Today I seem to. I made a big step with my\nrecovery today. After two 'clamp tests' to assess how much 'stuff' was still coming out of\nmy stomach, it was determined that my NG tube could be removed! It had been running\nthrough my nose into my stomach for five days, and was really starting to irritate my\nthroat, nose, stomach etc. As a result, I orally ingested my first food (30 ml of mango ice\nat one-hour intervals) in the past *six* days. Another bit of good news is that the tape\ncovering my incision was removed as it continues to heal. It's the same incision that was\nused in May (a zipper might have been easier at this point....). I still have quite a bit of\nabdominal pain, although it's certainly less than after last May's surgery. That will take\ntime to heal. However, I am coping with minimal pain meds at this point, whereas I spent\nthe first few days in a dialudid haze. Aside from one or two student nurses who definitely\nneed more training (they will get it here), my care has continued to be superb, with Drs.\nFang and Beavis as well as other doctors (eg pain team) closely monitoring my\ntreatment.\nI don't remember if my brother or Ben shared additional good news (my mind is still\nslightly foggy). The surgery went better than Dr. Beavis expected, in part because a)no\nostomy was needed (I had been anxious about this) and b)no significant cancer was\nfound. Dr. Beavis saw a few 'specks' that she sent to pathology to be biopsied. But she's\nnot even sure they are cancerous. If they are, her plan is to put me on the parp inhibitors\nI was debating taking a month of so ago instead of suggesting additional chemo. So\nthank goodness no more chemo for the time being. In the end, the surgeons 'took down'\nthe whole area surrounding the fistula, including the fistula itself, abscess and an\nadditional portion of my colon and small intestine. But I will recover and will be able to\nmanage with this reconfigured digestive system. \nOf course, as I deal with my own physical disequilibrium, the entire world has lost its\nequilibrium in ways that are terribly unsettling, scary, and troubling, rife with\nuncertainty. The verse from Hamlet came quickly to me: \"The time is out of joint...\" A\nfriend described this moment as 'dystopian,' which also rings true. I am so very sorry for\nour students who had to return from their study abroad experiences (or will not be\npermitted to undertake them this summer), for our seniors who will not be feted at our\nlovely end of the year awards ceremony (and perhaps not even at graduation; U of\nMichigan just cancelled theirs), for my colleagues who will be doing the heavy lifting as\nPenn State puts all its classes on line for the next several weeks. We're in uncharted\nterritory here...\nIt is always chilling, when I teach the medieval plague in my culture courses, to read\ncontemporary accounts of how the social fabric was rent by \"social distancing:\" once a\nhome was affected by the plague, children no longer visited dying parents, husbands\n                       393 / 1.901\ncould no longer tend to sick wives, babies died alone... The plague was the great social\nequalizer. Let's hope that friendship, love, relationships, conversations and all that\nmakes life a gift can continue - maybe even strengthen during this seemingly calamitous\ntime.\nI truly wish I could do more to help. But in the near future I must be very careful to\nprotect my immune system and limit my contacts, certainly avoiding large groups.\nFortunately (I guess), since Ben is teleworking all next week, he can drive me back to\nState College -- I'll likely be discharged Monday or Tuesday -- and stay at home for the\nweek, helping run errands for me, take me to a doctor's appointment etc. He's been\nnothing but a kind, patient, compassionate and helpful mensch during these last two\nsuccessive hospital stays and I am so lucky to have such a son. It's still very hard for him\nto watch me go through this, but by now we sort of 'know the drill' on some level, and we\nknow that we're getting through it together along with the rest of our very solid, loving\nsupport system. We sat outside today in the sun on a balcony overlooking the historic,\noriginal buildings of the Hopkins Medical Center, while he enjoyed a lunch of delicious-\nsmelling Jamaican jerk chicken (I got to smell it). We even had some great belly laughs\n(which hurt my belly!). My mother and brother have also been loving and invaluable\ncaregivers. I am so grateful.\nFinally, I received some welcome spiritual sustenance today, as my rabbi from State\nCollege called me and assured me that I'm in his prayers daily. Yesterday my dear first\ncousin David and wife Ilene visited (they live in Baltimore) and brought good cheer and\nassurances that they were davening and sending mi shebeirachs my way. Finally, the\nwonderful Methodist (yet ecumenical) chaplain here, Rhonda, came to chat and provided\na blessing of healing. I suggested that she send the blessing out not just to me and my\nfamily and the caregivers at Hopkins but to the entire world, which needs it now. Tonight\nis shabbat, a shabbat of the soul, maybe time for the entire world to detach, turn\ninwards, enjoy loved ones' company, and send love out around the globe.\nPhotos\n                       394 / 1.901\n                       395 / 1.901",

    "entry": "Just a quick update from Hopkins Hospital, which is in near total 'lockdown' now. There\nare armed guards at the entrances and personnel in full-body protective gear are\nscreening visitors. I can only receive one visitor at a time. I've been told that they're\nshort staffed because any health worker who has even a slight cold or feels\n'compromised' in any way is staying home. It certainly seems quiet here today, even\nthough the floor is full with patients. I have only the highest admiration for the health\nworkers I've encountered here (and all others), who are now on the front lines, patiently\ntaking blood and vital signs, administering meds and procedures. Based on my convos\nwith them, they understand fully the risks of the current situation -- to them and\neveryone. I was told that a Hopkins doctor has been affected by the virus but don't have\nconfirmation.\nI'm coming along well. Ate solid food for the first time since my operation today and it\nsat well, although my newly reconfigured digestive system is quirky. I think I've met all\nthe benchmarks, but now the docs have to stabilize my electrolyte levels, which were\nlow today. I'm really hoping that this won't impede my being discharged early this week,\nbut it's for my surgeon to decide tomorrow.\nOne of the worst things about these hospital stays, and about needing treatment for a\ndisease, is the pain. I've been in agony a few times since arriving here, including when a\npotassium/magnesium infusion began corroding one of my veins, sending shooting pain\nthrough my arm and hand. My abdomen still hurts a lot, especially when I stand up\nstraight. This pain will abate in time. I've been walking about eight laps around the\nhospital floor each day and look forward to continuing my walking when I'm home.\nOn some level, though, I feel like my problems \"don't amount to a hill of beans, in this\ncrazy world\" (a line that came to me forcefully today). I would like to be on the 'helping'\nside and not on the one needing help. I have been thinking about some ways I can do\nthis and am nurturing an idea or two... At the same time, I am very fortunate to belong\nto a caring community. My synagogue sent out a note saying that weekly Friday night\nservices would not be cancelled (a six feet separation between congregants will be\nrespected) and also reaching out to anyone in need at this time. No sooner had I written\nto the congregant coordinating this effort than she wrote me back to assure me that she\n                       397 / 1.901\nwould be happy to shop for me.  Another friend has offered the same, and my house\ncleaner is keeping my home ultra-clean and disinfected. So I consider myself quite\nfortunate, and will be able to focus on my continued recovery and start working at home\nbefore long. \nI have no words to describe my revulsion at the way our 'leader' has been handling the\ncrisis. He is in fact the opposite of a leader. How a Lincoln, a Roosevelt, a Churchill, an\nObama would have provided solace, wisdom, sound policies, and hope at this time, and\nhow they would have led by example. So tragic for our country.\nI ordered a 2000 piece puzzle of Cinque Terre for Ben and I to attack this week and I also\nplan to introduce him to _Casablanca_ (hence the reference above!).\nStay safe and healthy, everyone, and let's stay connected. Sending big e-hugs and lots\nof love, \nWilla",

She thinks I'm making good\nprogress and can continue my recovery at home. At the same time, she suggested that\nthe hospital is going to need more beds very soon... Tents are being set up outside to\naccommodate the overflow. I really feel like I've fled a rapidly-advancing tsunami here --\na very strange feeling indeed. The Hopkins personnel all understand that, as Dr. Fang\nsaid to me this morning, \"as doctors [and health professionals], we're obligated to treat\neveryone.\" Yet the atmosphere in the hospital seemed tense.\nI returned with some meds -- pain medication, a blood thinner (that I have to inject into\nmyself, not my favorite activity...), and some fiber powder to take 3X day. \nWonderful Ben was on hand to pick me up in my car and drive me home, on a fairly\nsunny early springlike day, across this strange new landscape (supermarket parking lots\nwere full, restaurant parking lots empty). A kind friend, Esther, dropped off some\ngroceries to tide us over for the first day or so.

    "entry": "Just a quick posting to share some good news: at Dr. Patel's office yesterday (I was\nnervous to even keep the appointment for fear of contagion, but he couldn't offer me\nanother one until August so...), he had just received from Hopkins the biopsy report for\nmy operation last Monday; Dr. Beavis had had three 'specks' biopsied at the time. Very\nhappily, those specks tested negative for cancer. So no IV chemo in the near future\nalthough, as mentioned, we may -- or may not -- try PARP inhibitors (a type of\nmaintenance chemo) in the interest of delaying a recurrence.\nNormally, this kind of good news would have me determined to grab life by the horns\nand ride it hard, ie by travelling, gathering with friends, dining out etc. Normally after\n                       401 / 1.901\nsuch news, my doctors advise me to do exactly that. I would get on the phone right now\nand buy a plane ticket to attend my friend Elisabeth's daughter's wedding in Burgundy in\nMay. Granted, I am still recuperating from surgery, but the \"honeymoon period\" I am\nenvisioning is simply not possible right now because of the coronavirus -- and of course I\nunderstand that. So the universe is sending me contradictory messages at this time and\nI need to think more on what it is trying to teach me. \nAfter seeing Dr. Patel, I had my port flushed in the chemo room. I feel fortunate not to be\nundergoing chemo right now, which would leave my immune system suppressed. I really\nfeel for those tackling this (Dr. Fang told me that my immune system is actually quite\n'ramped up' from surgery right now, although recent treatment for cancer does\nconstitute an'underlying condition'). Anyway, I asked the nurse how they've been faring\nsince the explosion of the virus and she replied: \"Fine, I think the media exaggerates the\nthreat of the virus anyway.\" I very rarely feel myself becoming irate, but I could sense\nmy face becoming red and my pulse quickening. \"And what evidence is this idea based\non?\" I asked her. \"It's just my opinion, Willa. I don't want to cause a rift.\" Before I\nlaunched into: \"What reason would the media have for exaggerating this public health\nthreat?\" \"Do you think all media are exaggerating the seriousness of the virus or just\nsome?\" and \"Do you think Johns Hopkins Medicine is exaggerating the threat by setting\nup tents outside the hospital and cordoning off an entire wing?,\" I managed to restrain\nmyself. It just seemed to me incredibly irresponsible -- and the word 'unpatriotic' also\ncame to mind - for a *health worker* to take a page from the FoxNews playbook. I even\nthought about reporting the nurse to the office manager. But I did not and will not. It just\nmade me mad. Very mad. End of rant.\nBen and I watched _Casablanca_ last night. What a brilliant film and how it rings true in\nthe current climate. Refugees flood Casablanca, fleeing a 'moral' plague and willing to\ntake all risks to preserve their safety. When Rick has to sell off his cafe because of the\nvolatile situation, he insists that his employees, especially the popular piano-player,\nSam, be kept on payroll to ensure their livelihood. Everything from mundane concerns to\ngreat loves seem overtaken by the sweep of history and politics in \"this crazy world.\"\nWe'll always have Paris...\nI continue to recover and Ben and I are hunkering down; he's working and I'm doing\nsome work, writing etc. It's peaceful here and we're fine. Maybe we'll watch _Raging\nBull_ tonight.  We'll go on a walk soon. Everyone take care, please.",

So glad all is going well and you sound like yourself. Mike\nand I have been at home a couple days and we too are watching movies and having\nquiet time. He\u2019s about to teleconference to Los Angeles for a few hours.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, March 18, 2020  \nDear Willa,\nI am thrilled to pieces by the good news about no evidence of cancer. Maybe, due to the\nvirus threat, this self-containment or isolation or whatever it is called will be a boon for\nyou.\nEverything has been cancelled here with a few exceptions: I think my NIA dance class is\nstill on, but no mats on the floor, no touching as we sometimes did in certain routines,\nand sign-in will be verbal, not written. The really BIG issue is whether my hair salon will\nbe open for my weekly indulgence.\nJake is coming over tomorrow to help me with some computer and printer issues and we\nhad hoped to go out for lunch afterwards but only drive-though or take-out is available at\nthe restaurants that are still functioning.. My mind cannot embrace the number of people\nwhose livelihoods are being affected by this crisis.\nI have an old/new friend in my life who is very valuable right now as he has a stash of old\nDVD'S; we recently saw \"Hopscotch\" with Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson, and \"To\nCatch a Thief\" with Cary Grant. Perhaps we, too, will see \"Casablanca\" this week.\nKeep up the good fight.\nLots of love,\n                       403 / 1.901\nAunt Marlene\n  \u2014Marlene Green, March 18, 2020  \nCh\u00e8re Willa, what a great news!!

    "entry": "404 / 1.901\nThe relentlessly upbeat, unflappable, and wonderful Dr. Anna Beavis (see pic) called me\nthis morning (gotta appreciate a doctor who will call on a Saturday morning) to follow up\nfrom last week's surgery. She didn't know whether I knew - but I did, from Dr. Patel --\nthat my biopsy had come back negative for cancer. She declared this news \"amazing.\"\nAnd I am rejoicing in it too! Because of this, there will be no cancer treatment of any kind\n(including with PARP inhibitors) for the foreseeable future. In any event, she said she\nwould discourage my taking the inhibitors at present because they'd suppress my\nimmune system, making me more susceptible to, for example, coronavirus (the irony of\nhaving survived cancer to die from coronavirus has not been lost on me). So unless I\nbecome symptomatic, I will now have a three-month *reprieve* before seeing Dr. Patel\nfor blood screening (to assess my CA125 number and other levels), with an appointment\nwith Dr. Beavis scheduled for three months after that. While I realize that 'remission' is a\nconditional state and while fully understanding the sobering statistics for recurrences\nwith ovarian cancer, I am embracing this welcome news, which couldn't come at a more\nopportune time.\nWe also discussed my upcoming (3/31) follow-up appointment with Dr. Fang. I had\nalready started to become nervous at the prospect of returning to Hopkins, where Dr.\nBeavis tells me that they are treating at least ten confirmed cases of coronavirus. Since\nmany patients apparently share my unease (>lots of cancellations), we discussed the\npossibility of a video appointment, during which Dr. Fang and I would talk about my\nprogress and she would (virtually) examine my incision. Dr. Beavis just needs to find out\nabout the legality (!) of this -- apparently, it becomes a bit complicated across state\nlines. Insurance coverage could be tricky too. We agreed that we're in uncharted\nterritory here...\nMeanwhile, I am coming along. Dr. Beavis had said to me: \"You may lose your spring, but\nyou'll have your summer and fall.\" I'm cautiously optimistic that I may be running ahead\n                       405 / 1.901\nof that timetable. However, I still have surgical pain, get a bit winded after a walk around\nthe block, and need a lot of sleep and rest (hopefully not a reflection of low red blood cell\nor magnesium/potassium levels). It's going to take me a while to get my stamina back,\nand all the injunctions on Facebook to Zumba, cook, live stream operas, virtually visit\nmuseums etc. make me feel even more strung out. Right now, I just need to be. I did\nhave enough energy yesterday, though, to make Indian rice pudding.\nThankfully, Ben is here and is a comforting, helpful, steady presence. As I write, he is\nworking on a 2000-piece puzzle of Cinque Terre that I bought for us to help bide the\ntime. I gave up after a while because I'm color blind and was tearing my hair out with all\nthe gradations of color. Ben is also color blind, although not as dramatically as I am. His\npowers of concentration and (Aries) stubbornness are helping him stick with it. We drove\ndowntown, which was virtually deserted, but people are out, here and there, biking,\njogging, strolling, walking their dogs.\nBen asked if the coronavirus was totally unprecedented in modern times. I told him that,\nfor me at least, while 9/11 shook our nation to its core, and while we more or less all\n'sheltered in place' on that day, only three areas of the country bore the awful physical\ntoll. AIDS was an epidemic with a frightful human cost, and we lost loved ones. Yet the\nscope of the coronavirus is much broader, cutting across a broad swath of ages, genders,\nsexual orientations, races, socioeconomic groups etc. As a New Yorker, I feel keenly the\nkind of 'New York-centric' hit of all three of these plagues, even as I realize that\ncoronavirus is devastating many other areas of our country too. What I am\nmourning/have mourned in all three crises is a type of insouciance, excitement, vibrancy\nand romance I associate with my hometown (and ditto for Paris). New York has risen\nfrom the ashes before. Will it again? What will anything or any of us be like on the other\nside?",
    "comments": "Although more parts of the country will be affected by Coronavirus than was the case\n9/11, those closely connected to the global economy will likely suffer much sooner. For\nexample, Austin will have many cases sooner than Pecos, out in the middle of nowhere\nwest Texas. The virus will eventually reach Pecos, but for now, this is mostly a city\nproblem.\n  \u2014Jim Davis, March 21, 2020  \nThree cheers for more good news -- and the prospect of spending the new season\nwithout chemo, PARP inhibitors, and all that flushing. You'll soon have energy to spare!\n(Can you envision liver & onions sometime soon to help things along?). As you recover,\nso will NYC -- which holds a large place in my heart as well. I hope that the city's 'doctors'\n                       406 / 1.901\nare as good as yours! At least Cuomo is taking decisive action to protect the population,\nwhile the feds continue to dither. When the crisis breaks, a doubly special celebration\nwill definitely be in order!! XO, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, March 21, 2020  \nHi Willa, wonderful news! I concur with your observations about the defining events in\nour lifetime. What also distinguishes the coronavirus era is its undefined, rolling nature\nover time, and yet \u201ceveryone knows\u201d about it in some fragmented way. We can\u2019t point\nto \u201cthe day\u201d of our seismic shift. But it is so amazing to see how we are all shifting to\nstay connected. I am trying not to read too much detail too, but FWIW, here\u2019s a great\npiece in today\u2019s NYT by Scott Kelly, a true stand-up guy. \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/scott-kelly-coronavirus-isolation.html. Love\nand virtual hugs, MW\n  \u2014Mary Wujek, March 22, 2020  \nI am thankful, grateful, happy and more with your good news. It is a wonderful gift to you\nand your large cheering squad.\nOne minor thing: your birthday has come and gone and I just wondered if you got the\ncard and little gift I sent.) I wanted you to know that I was thinking of you on March 4th,\nas always.\nLove,\nAunt Marlene\n  \u2014Marlene Green, March 22, 2020  \nThe remembrance of your hometown and Parisian \"insouciance, excitement, vibrancy\nand romance\" is like well water in the desert!

    "entry": "I realize it's been a while since I've written. The days have seemed to blur into one\nanother recently, during this strange parenthesis in our normal lives.\nMy recovery continues to go well, thankfully. I can stand up straighter as the abdominal\nsurgical pain continues to abate incrementally. My incision has closed into a scar and\nlooks fine. My stomach remains a bit unsteady but Dr. Fang has just prescribed some\nImodium that I hope will help. I'm adhering strictly to a low-fiber diet, which agrees with\nme. On April 9th Dr. Fang said I could start experimenting with some raw fruits and\nveggies. I definitely feel fatigued and need to rest during the day, but Dr. Fang reminded\nme that I had a major surgery and that 4-6 weeks of fatigue is perfectly normal. I'm\ngetting lots of extra sleep.\n                       408 / 1.901\nDr. Fang called me today to let me know that we can't meet virtually next Tuesday\nbecause I'm a 'Pennsylvanian.' Since she is licensed only in Maryland, apparently video-\nmeetings with out of state patients are illegal (I am not sure why this is the case, as in-\nperson meetings with out of state patients of course happen all the time at the hospital).\nHowever, we again agreed that an in-person meeting at Hopkins is not desirable for me\nat this time, as the hospital is treating coronavirus cases. So we pretty much had our\nappointment by phone (somehow, this is allowed...). I will also send her an image of my\nincision. And I'll follow up with any further questions by email. I'm obsessively focused on\nstaying out of the hospital for any reason.\nI feel very fortunate that I am not actively in treatment for cancer right now. The fact in\nitself is reason to be thankful, but (even the prospect of) confronting that 'double\nwhammy' of cancer and coronavirus makes me fearful. My immune system would be ill-\nequipped to handle it. Given the harrowing stories I'm reading in the _New York Times_\nabout packed to the gills hospital emergency rooms in the city, would I lose out if/when it\ncame to triaging patients, due to my doubly compromised condition? On the brighter (!)\nside, because of last May's operation and my recent treatment I 'know the drill' in terms\nof having to hunker down at home. It's not that dramatic an adjustment, although I do\nwonder about the psychic toll on all of us of so much isolation... When this is all over, I\nwill want to give everyone I know the *biggest* hug!\nI am so glad Ben is here. He has taken over my office (while I work at the dining table,\nnext to a big window) and seems busy with work. He has an upcoming decision to make\nabout grad school for next year, but as with everything else coronavirus has thrown a\nwrench into admissions timetables, campus visits etc. We've watched a few classic\nmovies - _Casablanca,_ _Raging Bull_ - and a good new documentary, _Crip Camp_\n(about the early disability rights movement). We take daily walks. And the puzzle is\ncoming along, but I'm afraid I sort of gave up on it. A number of friends have been kind\nenough to bring meals and grocery shop for me, and Ben has been very helpful around\nthe house. My support network has shrunk a bit since the virus hit, but I completely\nunderstand people wanting to be as risk-averse as possible.\n \nAs the one-year anniversary of my diagnosis approaches, and as I didn't begin writing\nthis journal until I had returned from the hospital in June (I believe), I will probably try to\nreconstruct the timeline of events, mainly last April, that led to my surgery on 9 May. I\nam not quite sure why I feel compelled to do this, as it will undoubtedly force me to\nrelive a trauma. Perhaps I need some clarity. Or some closure. Or some perspective. Or\nperhaps I have some morbid attachment to this 'series of unfortunate events.' I'm not\nsure. But it feels important to do, somehow.\nIn the interest of a bit of levity, I include a photo of my brother and me at the 1964 (!)\nWorlds Fair in Flushing Meadow, NY. (Thank you, Ethan, for the tremendous and\ngenerous job you've done in preserving our family archives, including some stills from\n                       409 / 1.901\nour films). I have some vivid memories of that Fair, including the attraction at which \"It's\na small world after all\" was played (I think I was with my grandmother). I wish I knew\nwhat I was staring at (or reading??) so intently in that photo (I was all of five years old,\nmy brother likely two), but our poses seem characteristic.",
    "comments": "So glad you\u2019re on the mend. Take care, and yes, stay out of the contagious hospitals!\nDon\u2019t even get on the road to the contagious hospital.\nLove that photo. I suggest a caption contest....\n  \u2014David Rothman, March 26, 2020  \nWilla, glad you're doing well. The issue about interstate telemedicine relates to the\nphysical location of the patient. If you as PA resident are seeing a physician in MD, that's\nunder Maryland's regulations; however, if you are physically in PA, then your Hopkins\nphysician is not licensed to deliver medical service to you in PA itself. We are facing this\ncomplex 50 state matrix as we try to set up telemedicine capabilities here, and it's a\nmorass despite the simplistic statements of our President that the process has been\nsimplified. And what's at stake? The MD who violates the rules could lose their license.\nMakes no sense in a world where anyone can get a Viagra prescription online, I know.\nBut that's what we're dealing with. Sorry for being so technical! Stay safe.\n  \u2014Steven Sherman, March 26, 2020  \nSo glad to hear from you Willa and to hear that your recuperation continues apace and\nthat Ben is with you for company and good cheer as we wait out this horrific situation.\nMuch love to you and keep the posts coming !

    "entry": "We continue to live in a state of suspended animation, the days blurring into one\nanother. Even my outfit rarely changes, although some days I'll put on some makeup.\nThe news is grim - there are hardly words to describe the situation. Close to 10.000.000\nunemployment claims! And an ocean of woe, fear, and uncertainty. Closer to home,\nwe've lost a cousin to COVID-19 -- our cousin Ruth Goldman in Toronto -- as her husband,\nmy mother's first cousin Gene, is now also hospitalized and in dire condition. Others we\nknow have overcome milder cases. And if April's tolls are as severe as predicted, we'll\nsurely all soon know someone affected. \nHere in Happy Valley we are relatively safe, although our local hospital just reported\nadmitting its first case of a patient with the virus. I am continuing to recover well from\nmy surgery, although I still have surgical abdominal pain and my digestive system\ndefinitely has a mind (or nervous system) of its own most of the time. I've been\nmonitoring my diet very carefully (on 9 April I can start adding some raw fruits and\nveggies to the mix) and have been allowing myself to sleep as much as I need. I was\nable to forego my appointment at Hopkins last week, opting instead for a phone meeting\nwith Dr. Fang, to whom I also sent photos of my incision. To these she replied:\"Looks\nbeautiful! You are healing extremely well!\" and \"You have done fabulously after\nsurgery.\" Of course, this was heartening to hear. However, I know that the sword of\nDamocles is always hanging over me in terms of a possible (likely?) recurrence. Today I\nstarted to let my mind wander to the small fluid pocket in my lower lung that Dr. Beavis\nhas been monitoring, until I realized that I was about five minutes away from a freak out.\n                       411 / 1.901\nLuckily, I was able to rein myself in and return to living in the moment.\nMeanwhile, Ben continues to work full days while I continue to work slightly shorter ones,\npunctuated by Zoom meetings with colleagues. I am anxious about the effects of the\ncrisis on higher education, one of x number of institutions that will undoubtedly be\nadversely affected. In good news, Ben will stay at least two more weeks! He is going to\nDC tomorrow to bring back his girlfriend, Sammi, who will stay with Ben's dad (Michael)\nand stepmother (Sue). We have put in place many precautions to safeguard my health\n(and everyone else's). Decisions large and small seem so fraught these days... Kind\nfriends and neighbors have been bringing meals every other day while Ben and I cook\nsimple dishes on the intervening days (I hope to concoct something a bit more ambitious\nfor Ben's 25th birthday on Saturday). We are well fed and housed and have everything\nwe need. We take walks in the lovely early spring weather. I consider myself extremely\nlucky.",

    "entry": "As best as I can remember, it was last April that I started feeling 'symptomatic.' Granted,\nI had begun to feel slightly bloated as early as January (?), but rationalized it this way: a)I\nsit on my ass in front of a computer all day and have become lazy about exercise; b)as a\nresult of a)I have gained weight. No wonder my stomach appears a bit distended when I\nlook at myself from the side in the mirror, but when I suck in my stomach the bulge goes\naway - so voil\u00e0, it can't be cancer.\nBesides, I was simply too busy to have cancer. As a first-year department head, I was\nworking ten hour days. (This, incidentally, became another rationalization: I work ten-\nhour days, have a hearty appetite, and sleep well for the most part; ergo, I can't possibly\n                       413 / 1.901\nhave cancer). I was also firmly intent on bringing to fruition my week-long Holocaust-\nfocused trip to Paris over spring break, with eighteen students in tow, which I had been\nplanning for a year. The trip is immensely meaningful to me personally, and the students\ninvariably consider it 'transformative' too. So I downplayed the bloating, and we went to\nParis. The trip was extraordinary.\nIn fact (and my mind is a bit fuzzy here), I opted to cancel a January appointment to have\na sonogram. I believe this was recommended follow-up after a routine ob-gyn checkup I\nhad had a month prior. My dim memory is that I did not like the doctor or physician's\nassistant I had for the first time at that appointment. I had to convince her to provide a\nPAP smear (she didn't think it was necessary) and I can't remember if it was her or me\nthat requested the follow-up sonogram -- the one that I didn't wind up having until\nMarch.\nBut by early April, as mentioned, I began to have tell-tale symptoms, and they continued\nto worsen (as I'll describe in a future post). The abdominal bloating continued. When I\nlifted something heavy (like my school bag), I felt a tugging or pulling in my abdominal\narea. I also began to feel progressively more tired (rationalization: it's been a heck of a\nbusy school year, and it's almost at its end. No wonder you're exhausted). I would come\nhome from work/grocery shopping by 7:30/8:00, sink down into my couch, inert, and\nthink to myself: \"Shit, I feel *really* exhausted.\"\nWriting the above is a bitter truth serum. There is obviously self-blame, even though Dr.\nBeavis, in our first conversation, tried very strongly to dissuade me of that. If I knew then\nwhat I know now, I like to think that I would not have been so cavalier about ignoring my\nsymptoms. And I would encourage *any woman* with symptoms like the ones I describe\nto seek medical help immediately. So let this be a cautionary tale. But it is what it is. In\nmy defense (more rationalizations coming, or simply reasonable explanations?), ovarian\ncancer, the so-called \"silent killer,\" is notoriously asymptomatic, often not becoming fully\nsymptomatic until it's late stage (which was my case, as I was diagnosed at stage IIIC).\nUntil April, my symptoms were indeed mild and easily confusable with weight gain, extra\nbelly fat as a result of not exercising often enough etc. Several girlfriends reported\nsimilar types of bloating in conjunction with their periods. Further, it is not certain at all\nthat a sonogram in January would have revealed cancer; in fact, once I had the\nsonogram in March, it showed something suspicious on my left ovary but did not detect\nthe more serious problem area on my right ovary, because that area was located higher\nup in my abdominal cavity than the sonogram could detect.\nI could likely have done more. And that's an awful truth to accept. I also could have done\nless, ignoring the symptoms even when they became alarming. But I did not. What's\nmost important for me right now, in the end, is to be completely and ceaselessly\nproactive about my treatment going forward. And I believe I'm succeeding in that. \n  \n                       414 / 1.901",

Please stay\nwell and safe! XO\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, April 2, 2020  \nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s helpful, Willa, but honestly recognizing the slight symptoms a few\nmonths earlier actually wouldn\u2019t have altered your course. You are describing perhaps\nnoticing things 1-4 months earlier, and though nobody knows for sure, the development\nand spread of cancerous cells was most (very!) probably well underway by then. The\ntruth is if one had no denial or reluctance or reason to postpone....if one went to the ob-\ngyn at the first sign of the slightest sense of a perceivable change, that always will be\none of the less-than-early stages of ovarian cancer. It all happens stealthily and by the\ntime any woman can notice any change, it\u2019s probably already spread. Unfortunately\nthat\u2019s the nature of this \u2018internal\u2019 cancer and many others too. Nobody can report the\nearly stages because the cancer is in a place that causes no symptoms until it\u2019s gone\nfrom the pelvis into the abdominal cavity. Truly, my friend, please don\u2019t spend another\nsecond thinking \u2018what if\u2019 and have any hint of self-recrimination. The cancer is trouble\nenough on its own without self doubts. I want to give you a big hug and assure you\nnobody can \u2018catch\u2019 this early enough to make a significant difference in their staging.\nMost probably it began on the cellular level a year or two or three before your body can\nfeel anything. You have been good to yourself and your body. There\u2019s nothing different\nthat would have made things different. You are doing the best you can and more and\nmore than you ever expected. It\u2019s been grueling enough without doubts.

    "entry": "416 / 1.901\n                       417 / 1.901\nSpring has arrived, with its delicate sunlight and pretty pink and yellow flowers. I\nremember sitting by an open window in the rocker with Ben, then an infant, in the weeks\nfollowing his birth on 4 April, and literally watching the buds fatten and bloom over the\ncourse of those first few weeks. It seemed as if Ben and the earth were coming to life\nsimultaneously, and since then I've always felt that early April was a most poetic time for\na birthday. Then on the 19th of that month, I turned on the t.v. as I prepared to nurse\nBen, only to witness the horrific images of the Oklahoma City bombing, including of small\nchildren, covered with debris and blood, being evacuated. Horror amidst the beauty - an\nearly lesson. And not the 'agreeable horror' of the sublime, but unmitigated horror linked\nto evil and mass destruction. \nThis year Ben's twenty-fifth birthday came amidst another wave of mass destruction, this\none wreaked by nature. And Ben certainly understood that in the face of so much\ncalamity, this bday would necessarily be different. So our celebration was a bit tamped\ndown, but I was still intent on observing this important milestone. I awoke early on\nSaturday morning (Ben's bday) and made a yummy chocolate mousse from Patricia\nWells' Paris bistro cookbook.This actually tired me out a bit (all that beating of egg yolks\nand whites, not to mention of the whipped cream!), as I still get fatigued during the day.\nBut I pressed on and in the afternoon cooked fesenjoon, a delicious Persian chicken stew\nwith pomegranate molasses and ground walnuts that I have enjoyed in a Persian\nrestaurant in Paris. Ben, meanwhile, had driven to D.C. Friday afternoon to pick up his\ngirlfriend, Sammi, who was not faring entirely well in isolation and who had been self-\nquarantining for several weeks. Sammi will stay with Ben's dad and stepmom for the\nforeseeable future while Ben stays here. I would have liked for all of us to be together on\nBen's bday but we are trying to minimize contact, especially in my case. So Ben and I\ndrove to Michael's the next day to deliver three portions of the chocolate mousse and to\nchat a bit with Sammi, at a six foot distance. My bday present for Ben, ordered long ago\noff Amazon, will not arrive for several more weeks.\nThese were all very minor adjustments, though, and we fully realize how privileged we\nare, as well as comparatively safe in State College, where our local hospital is only\ntreating two COVID-19 patients and where our county has so far counted about forty\ncases. This past weekend, within three days, we lost not only my cousin Ruth but her\nhusband, my mother's first cousin Gene, both victims of COVID in Toronto.\nWhile mellower than usual, Ben's bday was lovely and to top it off we enjoyed watching a\nfew episodes of our newest guilty pleasure, Tiger King, a disturbing and fascinating\ndocumentary with an appropriately eerie, 'end times' vibe.\nEvery parent wants to keep her/his kid/s safe. As long as Ben and Sammi are here in\nState College, I feel (rightly or wrongly) that I can ensure their safety. But I know too that\n                       418 / 1.901\ntheir relatively privileged lifestyle is not shared by many millennials who, unlike Ben, are\ncrippled by student debt, have little savings, and now face uncertain job prospects at a\ntime when they should be launching their careers, relationships and other foundational\naspects of their lives. I feel so badly for them. What kind of world will these kids confront\nonce we return to 'normal?' Ben said to me one day recently: \"There's nothing to look\nforward to.\"\nI am still feeling pretty well, thank goodness, but I can't say I'm fully recovered by any\nmeans. I did walk a mile the other day! My overall stamina is increasing. And I am\nboasting some nice curves due to weight loss (but yes, what a way to lose the pounds,\nand also: I'm all curvy with no place to go...). I just pray that my remission will continue\nand that I can avoid a return to chemo for as long as possible.\nA virtual happy hour (dubbed \"l'heure heureuse\") with my grad school besties made me\nhappy this past Friday. Not the same as in person of course, but a warming hour and a\nhalf nevertheless. So happy to see Isa and Rob, Vinni, Shanny and Sally safely ensconced\nin their living rooms and kitchens, enjoying an ap\u00e9ritif (a virgin one for me...). Shanny\neven got our her crystal, now a bit of a ritual when we gather, so we could ask it some\nquestions about what the future holds.\nStay well and safe, everyone.\nPhotos\n                       419 / 1.901\n                       420 / 1.901\n                       421 / 1.901\n                       422 / 1.901\n                       423 / 1.901\n                       424 / 1.901",

    "entry": "We managed to have a lovely Passover, Ben and I, despite all the constraints, perhaps\nfirst among them limiting our Seder to a party of two, whereas large gatherings of family\nand friends have most always been our norm. Intent on approximating at least some of\nmy own personal rituals around the Seder, I cooked several dishes -- matzah farfel\nstuffing with sauteed mushrooms and onions; tzimmes of carrots, butternut squash,\nsweet potatoes and prunes; chicken thighs in a honey mustard sauce (a pale cousin of\n\"Mrs. Schindler's chicken,\" a recipe my aunt shared with me years ago that has since\nbecome a holiday favorite); and apple compote. My biggest culinary regret is that I didn't\nhave the 'fixins' to make chicken soup w/matzah balls this year, nor chopped liver, which\nI sometimes prepare as well. The cooking, admittedly, made me tired (although I'm an\nold hand at \"cook 'til you drop,\" usually spreading my holiday cooking out over several\nfull days). I'm not back to full energy yet, and needed to take breaks to lie down on my\nbed. I also enjoyed setting a pretty table with my 'nice' (ie wedding) china, Lenox seder\nplate, candlesticks and kiddush cup, platter for matzah, and some colorful orchid plants.\nAs the friend kind enough to shop for me couldn't find a shank bone, I put a post-it on\nthe plate in its stead!\nBen and I read from two different haggadot as we retold (and in theory, 'relived') the\nstory of the exodus from Egypt, the passage from slavery to freedom. Along with the\ntraditional blessings during candle lighting, I read a \"Prayer for Passover in the Era of\nCOVID-19,\" which I found quite meaningful (from the Reform Judaism\nwebsite: https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2020/04/06/prayer-passover-era-covid-19) Other\ncurrent resonances of the story struck me too: the Egyptians and \"people of Israel\"\n\"sheltering in place\" as God assailed them with plagues (we counted not ten but eleven,\nthe last one being the one we're living through now); the trials of hunger and suffering\n(we are enjoined to invite anyone who is hungry to come eat our Passover table, and I\nwish I could have done just that); the value of perseverance and courage in finding one's\n                       426 / 1.901\nway out of a 'narrow place of bondage' (mitzrayim/Egypt); the promise of redemption\nand an end to suffering, augured by the prophet Elijah. I told Ben that my cancer journey\nhas often felt like it was requiring 'biblical' quantities (and qualities) of courage and\nstrength. As every year, I'm left with questions about the story: was it really necessary\nfor God to slay the Egyptians' first-born sons? What kind of God seeks retribution in this\ncruel way? Still, it was meaningful for us to discuss the story, which we followed with a\nfew not necessarily traditional songs (although we did sing a spirited \"Dayenu\"): Linda\nHirschorn's \"Circle Chant,\" which I love (\"Circle round for freedom/Circle round for\npeace/For all of us imprisoned/Circle for release/Circle for the planet/Circle for each\nsoul/For the children of our children/Keep the circle whole\")\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-UiDzeexU)\nand \"Miriam's Song,\" which we used to sing with Ben when he was little, about Moses'\nsister Miriam and the other Israelite women \"dancing with their timbrels\" after they had\ncrossed through the Red Sea.\nAfter dinner we FaceTimed with Ben's Berkman family in Amherst, MA, and with my\nbrother and family in the city. Several of the men are now sporting pretty wild-looking\nbeards! Nice to feel connected to family but hope that next year we'll be able to gather\nwith loved ones.\nI continue to feel pretty well overall, sort of status quo. I do have some occasionally achy\nareas in my abdomen, one near the incision the other on my right side, near the site of\nthe actual surgery. I've written my surgeon several times to figure out how to distinguish\nbetween abdominal surgical pain and pain due to something else, but have not heard\nback. I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but I'm getting paranoid about cancer\npatients being overlooked against the backdrop of coronavirus. A recent NPR story\nreported on just this, but in my particular case I have no evidence to support this\nsuspicion. I will just need to be a bit more persistent. And for the most part my health\n*does* appear to continuously improve. Fingers crossed.\nThere will always be another gloss on the Passover/Easter convergence for me, and not a\npleasant one. By Passover last year (it fell later in April than this year) I was not feeling\nwell at all. A few days before Passover, a sonogram had revealed what appeared to be a\ngrowth on one of my ovaries (as I mentioned in another post, a growth on the *other*\novary, undetected by the sonogram, turned out to be much more problematic). I was\nscheduled to have a follow-up test after Easter to confirm these initial results. I felt\nfreaked out, and in my recollection (admittedly, much 'fuzz' surrounds this period for me)\ndid not share the information with many people at all, intent on waiting for the follow-up\ntest. But I did tell my friend Monique -- I remember tears, fear, trepidation. She managed\nto calm me down and convinced me to not rush to the worst-case scenario until I had\nmore information. So the Hillel-sponsored Passover seder we attended on campus\nshortly after that was a strange affair for me -- and likely Monique too. Surrounded by\nstudents we didn't know for the most part, we felt a bit out of our element, even as I\n                       427 / 1.901\ngamely attempted to chat up a very sullen, largely silent grad student at our table while\nthe three undergrads across from us remained glued to their cell phones. But the event\nwasn't unpleasant, and the food was tasty. Throughout dinner I felt preoccupied and\nworried, though, by the recent sonogram results. Once home, I sank into my couch,\nexhausted and stressed. Easter would soon bring another blow.\nSorry to end on this sad note in the midst of the holiday season. Wishing everyone the\nblessings of good health, peace and a sense of renewal.   \n  \nApril 14, 2020 - A revolution",

    "entry": "I'm gazing at the lovely pink-purple lilacs that my friend Sandy brought me the other\nday, along with a Passover-themed dinner of roast chicken with tsimmes and a potato\nkugel (all delicious). At this time of year, as if on cue, fragrant lilacs bloom along \"Deans'\nWalk,\" a path on campus that runs under the deans' offices in Sparks Building. They\nwere blooming a year ago at this time. Since then, the earth has completed its orbital\npath, its revolution around the sun. \nThe good news, as Ben reminded me the other day, is that I'm doing much better than I\nwas a year ago, although it's been quite an odyssey. Last year on Easter I had been\nsuffering from worrisome constipation for several days. Worrisome, because none of the\nknown remedies, including lots of dried fruit and water, walking, yoga stretches etc.\nseemed to 'work'. Later I found out that what was causing the blockage were lesions in\nmy colon... I became so alarmed that I jumped in my car and drove to Med Express, only\nto learn that there would be a wait as long as four hours (on Easter?...). Then, almost on\nautopilot, I did something I'd never done before: I drove myself to the ER at our local\nhospital. The very young, rookie-looking ER doctor on call that day examined me,\npressing against my stomach, and then sent me to have a CT-scan. I remember the\ntechnician asking me, after I had the scan, \"how long have you not been feeling well?\"\nand then looking pointedly at me and saying: \"Good luck.\" The young doc came in a bit\nlater, hurriedly, flustered, showed me the CT image, and said something like: \"The\nradiologist has looked at your imaging and believes he sees a malignancy.\" (To be\nhonest, the only word I definitely remember hearing was 'malignancy'). The doctor then\nshowed me the image and indicated all the places -- body parts such as 'omentum,'\nwhose names I had never heard before, along with familiar organs such as the ovaries --\nwhere a malignancy had been detected. Strangely, though, he hastened to tell me that\n\"this doesn't mean for sure that you have cancer,\" and he counseled me to make an\nappointment asap with an ob-gyn oncological surgeon at Geisinger medical center in\nDanville.\n                       428 / 1.901\nTo be honest, the rest of the day was a blur. My friend Clare, whom I had planned to\nmeet for tea, came to my house and talked me down from hysteria, helping me focus on\nthe immediate tasks at hand, such as making plans to consult a gyn-onc in Danville. She\nwas kind enough to stay overnight with me (and to buy the medication I needed to\nrelieve the constipation); I'll always be grateful to her for this. I had heart-wrenching\nconversations with my mother, brother, Michael and Ben, stressing though that I awaited\na definitive diagnosis from a specialist. The irony of receiving this awful blow on Easter --\na day of renewal, rebirth, redemption and the promise of life eternal that also turned out\nto be one of the worst days of my life -- crossed my mind at some point. But my thoughts\nbecame a tangled jumble, and by the time I went to bed I was exhausted.\nYes, happily doing better for now (although how could I ever have anticipated, that day\nin the ER, the plague that would hit us all a year later, compounding my concern about\nmy health?). I'm looking forward to driving this week for the first time since early March,\nand to working some raw fruits and veggies into my diet. Easter this year passed quietly.\nThe previous day Ben and I drove over the mountains and down into the next valley,\nwhere in the largely Amish village of Belleville horses were plowing, farmers hoeing, and\nplain black clothing fluttering in the wind on clothes lines. It smelled earthy, like spring!\nWe crossed over a creek where a horse and buggy had stopped so that the driver could\nfly fish. It all felt rather idyllic and reminded me that the earth's revolutions bring beauty\nand stability as the seasons change, a counterpoint to all the uncertainty currently\nunsettling us. \nBen is at Michael and Sue's this week but I expect that he (or he and Sammi) will return\nhere next week or the week after. We are so happy to have them here until they feel\ncomfortable returning to D.C.\nI have been enjoying some 'fun' reading recently -- Julian Barnes' _The Man in the Red\nCoat_ (the title alludes to a portrait by Sargent of Samuel Pozzi, a renowned surgeon and\nsociety figure of the Belle Epoque) and now Ann Patchett's latest, _The Dutch House._\nStay well and safe, everyone!

    "entry": "430 / 1.901\nThis is the longest break I've taken from my blog since I started writing last June.\nEverything had been going along smoothly, without much 'news' to report, almost with a\ncertain insouciance on my part due to the sameness of days and routine, walks in the\nneighborhood, long nighttime sleeps, nice dinners at home with Ben and Sammi,\nwatching the tube after dinner (the ESPN series on Michael Jordan and the Bulls is\nawesome). All of this, of course, against a deeply worrisome backdrop apparent in the\nNYTimes headlines that I probably shouldn't look at - but do - first thing when I wake up.\n...until yesterday's bloodwork punctured the reassuring rhythm of the days and my\nconfidence that I could *will* a non-return to any kind of medical office. Admittedly, for\nthe past while (few weeks? since my last surgery?) my stomach/digestive system have\nfelt a bit 'unhappy' (as a friend aptly put it), without going into too much detail. Trying to\ntweak my dose of Imodium hasn't seemed to help much and there's been some\ndiscomfort on my right side, which I've attributed to surgical pain. At the same time, I felt\nfrustrated to not have received a response to four or five emails I sent Dr. Fang (who\nperformed the last surgery) about my feeling a bit 'off.' This led me instead to call my\n(ex) bro-in-law, David, a gastroenterologist, who encouraged me to reach out to my\nbroader team of doctors, and to have bloodwork done -- which Dr. Patel promptly\nordered. \nYesterday afternoon, I went to Dr. Patel's office -- rather empty and therefore a bit eerie\n-- for the labs and a port flush. It was the first time I had been in a medical facility since\nleaving Hopkins on 16 March and thus my first encounter with a 'masked' and often\ngloved population. What a strange, depressing and anxiety-provoking - albeit necessary -\nmode of social interaction. In any event, Dr. Patel called me shortly after I returned home\nto tell me that two of my four markers for liver function were 'significantly' elevated. He\nsaid that he wanted to wait until the CA125 number (ovarian cancer marker) came in the\nfollowing day to suggest next steps. That number came in this morning at 34.6. This is\nabout ten 'points' above what is was last time (25, I believe) but still, I think, at the upper\nlimit of what's considered 'normal' (35). So next step is an abdominal sonogram\ntomorrow morning and a redo of the blood work next week.\nFortunately I had a therapy session today, which helped me temper the panic response\nthat the news about the liver function markers induced in me. H. reminded me that panic\nserves a useful purpose, grabbing our attention and directing it to something that may\nwell need it to be directed to. And we agreed that, while I often tend to catastrophize\nand run to worst-case scenarios (liver cancer following the removal of a small patch of\nmy liver last May? the necessity of returning to Hopkins, aka COVID-central, absent the\nreassuring presence of family?), it's counterproductive for me to lean too heavily into\nthose thoughts in the absence of more complete information. Instead, I am leaning into\nthe fact that I have a stellar, rock-solid support network and also that I 'know the drill,' as\nfar as this illness goes. And -- as I repeated to myself out loud several times today -- in\nmy mind, I've already been through the worst, ie the initial cancer diagnosis and\n                       431 / 1.901\ndebulking surgery. I can likely deal with whatever might be thrown at me next.\nI'll keep everyone posted.\n'The worst' began to transpire exactly a year ago, during the last week of classes, ie this\ncurrent week, the week the lilacs, as if on cue, spring into fragrant bloom along \"Deans'\nwalk,\" a path that runs along the windows of the Liberal Arts deans' offices. On Tuesday\nof this week, a year ago, my kind friend Gay drove me to Geisinger Medical Center in\nDanville, where I met with a gyn onc surgeon, Dr. Gogoi, whom my doctors here in State\nCollege had set me up with. As I didn't know what the options were at that point\nregarding treatment, I thought she seemed competent. I remember certain sound bites,\nsuch as: \"If you've been advised to come here for an appointment, you must know it's\nfairly serious\" and \"You need to feel comfortable with me, as this may be the beginning\nof a long relationship\" (I received a form letter a few months later announcing her\nimminent departure from her practice). She performed a pelvic exam on me that was\nhorrifically painful because of the cancer. I was in tears nearly the whole time, and Gay\nshowed a lot of fortitude in remaining 'present' for me. We went to Friendly's after the\nappointment and had ice cream cones. I felt drained. Such a difficult day. It also\nhappened to coincide with the second to last session of my course on France and the\nHolocaust, which my intern, Morgane, kindly took over for me while I was at Danville. I\nthink that class knew vaguely that there was something 'wrong;' I could tell by their\nworried or confused expressions when I returned for the last class on Thursday, rising to\nthe occasion as best I could.\nAlso that week -- but my timeline may be fuzzy -- in a panic but still managing to think\nsomewhat clear-sightedly, I contacted my college classmate (and former dorm mate),\nSteven Sherman, who I knew was a prominent physician at the Anderson Cancer Center\nin Houston. We likely hadn't spoken since college (although we are Facebook friends),\nbut Steve without hesitation offered to see if he could connect me with doctors at world-\nclass medical centers within striking distance from State College (\"we'll get you\nsituated,\" he said). A flurry of emails, phone calls, and faxed test results later, Steve had\nspoken with colleagues at Hopkins. A day or two later, I received a phone call from the\nwonderful Dr. Anna Beavis (perhaps more on that thread another time). Steve will always\nbe one of my angels -- or perhaps rather a great doctor? a trusted friend and classmate?\na mensch? All of the above?\nAbout the same time I reached out to Marty, the father of a childhood friend of Ben's,\nwhose wife had battled OC for a good eight years (he's also a PSU colleague in the\nsciences). As with Steve, I intuited that these people might be my needed 'anchors' at a\ntime when I felt completely adrift, drowning in a loss of certainty about *anything.* Marty\ncame to my office, hugged me warmly, asked questions, and shared the early 'narrative'\nof Wendy's cancer - her symptoms, their search for the best treatment, his assessment\nof how family dynamics changed etc. I remember, again, being in a very 'ramped up,'\n                       432 / 1.901\npanicked state during that conversation (I was talking very quickly, kept breaking down\netc.). While I've been less frequently in touch w/Marty recently, I know that he's still part\nof my 'village' and a trusted support.\nAround the same too, finally - the days in a two-week or so period all meld together in\nmy memory -- I was in a monthly meeting with the heads of the other language/literature\ndepartments. I kept getting calls from Geisinger, including one during which Dr. Gogoi\nconfirmed my ovarian cancer diagnosis, each time returning to my meeting after having\nto leave the room to take the call. Embarrassed at having to run in and out of the room,\ndevastated, my mind racing, I sat through the rest of the meeting before getting out\nthrough my tears to two of my colleagues who had lingered in the conference room: \"I\nhave cancer.\" They were, of course, empathic, hugging me as did a third colleague\nwhose office I barged into to explain why I had had to keep disrupting the meeting.\nThose nightmare days seem, in some ways, long ago, thankfully. This journey's made me\nstronger for sure. I want to live to experience another blessed day - even (or maybe\nespecially) in the midst of a plague - to be able to look at my pretty orchid plants on my\ndining room table, next to the 2000 piece puzzle that Ben and Sammi have almost\nfinished, to trade emails and texts with friends and family, and to enjoy a nice dinner at\nhome followed by a sound night's sleep. More than enough to be thankful for, I'm sure.",

    "entry": "I've been busy the past few days preparing for, then participating in, a dissertation\ndefense, reading a second student's dissertation, and writing up questions for Ph.D.\ncomps, among other work tasks -- and that's a good thing. A year ago today I could do\nnone of that. In fact, today is what I'm calling my 'alive day,' not necessarily in the way\nthat veterans refer to it (as the day they survived being severely wounded in battle) but\nto mean the day I survived \"the mother of all surgeries\" and was rid of 99% of the visible\ncancer invading my body. It was the day I got a second chance.\nIf I have my chronology straight, on 6 May 2019 my brother Ethan rented a car and\ndrove from New York to pick me up in State College before we headed to Baltimore. I\n                       436 / 1.901\nknew that this was a huge 'ask' on my part as I rarely request favors of this magnitude\nfrom my brother. But he immediately rearranged his schedule to help me. Your being\nthere when I needed it most has not been forgotten, Ethan. My brother had actually\nnever been to visit me at my present address, but we didn't linger long. We lunched on a\ncouple of salads I had picked up from Trader Joe's and were then Baltimore-bound. I was\nwearing yoga pants and an old pink Penn State hoodie that I throw on when I want to\nfeel both comfortable and comforted (on long plane rides for example), as my abdomen\nached and I generally felt ill. During our drive on a pretty spring day, we caught up on\nsome family news, the chitchat also comforting despite the undercurrent of anxiety. \nUnfortunately, the hotel we had booked was in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, which\nadded stress. As I recall, Ben joined us from D.C. and the three of us went to dinner at a\nnot great Turkish (?-Ethan will remember) restaurant. We kept up the small talk but\nagain I could tell we all felt tense over what was looming. I tried to take deep breaths\nand stay as calm as possible. I had cried so much during the previous week that I simply\nfelt worn out and ready to get on with the surgery.\nThe following day I had my first meeting with Dr. Beavis (Ethan and Ben accompanied\nme), with whom I had only spoken by phone once previously and who was to perform my\nsurgery the next day, as she was leaving shortly after that for a European cycling\nvacation. Again, I consider it a tremendous stroke of luck that, in rapid succession and\njust about a week earlier, I had contacted my college friend Steve Sherman who in turn\nreached out to colleagues at Hopkins who then set me up with Dr. Beavis, who just\nhappened to have one opening for surgery the following week.The meeting with Dr.\nBeavis is something of a blur because much of what she told me (regarding prognosis for\novarian cancer patients, for example) felt scary and devastating, as also mirrored in the\ntear-filled, bleary-eyed faces of my brother and Ben, so painful for me to witness. She\ndescribed in detail the 'debulking' surgery she would perform. This would entail a\nmeticulous removal of the visible cancer; a liver surgeon, Dr. Burns, would also be on\nhand as some cancer has 'blown' off my ovary like dandelion fluff onto my liver. What\nreassured me were Dr. Beavis' clear explanations and kind manner, already in evidence\nwhen I had spoken with her on the phone and she had asked me about my support\nsystem before anything else. I left her office feeling stunned. We headed to the\npharmacy to pick up a few medications that I would need for a bowel prep that night.\nBack at the hotel, my mother had arrived (again if I'm remembering correctly). At some\npoint, my mother, brother and Ben must have eaten dinner as I had to fast. The\nGatorade and other liquids I needed to drink made me sick to my stomach and I\ncontinued to vomit throughout a sleepless night, the lowest point of this 'prologue' to my\nsurgery. We were all upset and Ben and I were clinging to each other as I tried to\ncomfort him. My instinct is to draw a veil across that evening because it was so\ntraumatic.\n                       437 / 1.901\nI believe we arrived at the hospital several hours before my surgery, scheduled for early\nafternoon. As I lay in a bay in the pre-op unit, the anesthesiologist came by to introduce\nhimself and I believe we saw Drs. Beavis and Burns as well. I remember climbing onto\nthe operating table by myself in a large, very brightly lit room buzzing with activity. The\nnext I remember is waking up in the ICU. The operation had taken thirteen hours so it\nspanned May 8th and 9th; Dr. Beavis had emerged from surgery to talk to my family at\nabout 1:00 a.m. on the 9th and said that the operation had gone well. The four of them\nhad all left the hospital together as Dr. Beavis' fiance was picking her (and her bicycle)\nup. Meanwhile, I was intubated and gagging; I gestured frantically at a blurry figure near\nmy bed to remove the tube but she said she couldn't yet. She encouraged me to relax\nand showed me the pump I could press to release pain medicine at five minute intervals.\nThat helped. My glasses had been removed so I could barely make anything out, but if I\nsquinted I could read the wall clock: 6 a.m. As I became more alert, I also became more\nconscious of the pain. But for the moment, disoriented and groggy, I was awake enough\nto realize that I was alive - and that was plenty.\nSo on this one-year anniversary of my 'alive day,' I've been to the farmers market\n(masked and gloved), have sent work emails, straightened my house a bit, and may\ntreat myself to some clothes shopping now that stores have reopened here. My digestive\nsystem is still kinda 'wonky' from my second surgery (which, while 'only' six hours,\nturned out to be the doozy), but I'm generally feeling pretty well. The troubling liver\nenzyme markers detected in a blood test two weeks ago have come down but are still\nabove normal; I'll have my blood retested in a week in the hopes that they've come\ndown further. And I'll see Dr. Patel, my oncologist here, in June for a routine visit,\nincluding bloodwork to assess my CA125 number.\nI'm looking forward to a lovely Mother's Day tomorrow with Ben and Sammi. I spent the\nlast one in the hospital.\nYesterday Diane, a fellow OC survivor who has become a friend through our shared\nexperience, texted me for World Ovarian Cancer Day. \"Happy Day, warrior!!!!!\" Yes,\nhappy day indeed.",

    "entry": "Dear friends, On Sunday 7 June I will be participating, in State College, in the 2020 Stride and Thrive\nrun/walk, organized under the aegis of Johns Hopkins Medical Center, as an ovarian cancer survivor. All\nproceeds will support gynecologic cancer research and clinical trials, training for gynecologic oncology\nfellows, and gynecologic cancer survivors through the Susan L. Burgert, M.D. Gynecologic Oncology\nSurvivorship Program. Last year, the race raised more than $240,000 and had 900 participants! I would be\nhonored if you would consider joining my team, #willapower, which will entail your walking 1 mile or\nrunning 5k on June 7th, wherever you are (as unfortunately we can't be in Baltimore this year due to\nCOVID-19). To register (the $40 registration fee will go directly to the fundraising total), go\nto charmcityrun.com/hopkins. Should you wish to make a donation without participating in the walk/run,\nplease go to runsignup.com/willapower. Please contact me should you have questions. Thank you for\n                       443 / 1.901\nconsidering a contribution to this Important (and important to *me*) cause!\nMy personal note (from my fundraising page):\nIn April 2019, after experiencing a period of mild abdominal bloating (OC is notoriously\nasymptomatic), I was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian cancer (because it is notoriously\nasymptomatic OC is usually diagnosed at stage III or IV). Last May I underwent a thirteen\nhour 'debulking' sugery at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, during which 99% of the\n*visible* cancer was removed from my body, followed by six rounds of chemotherapy. In\nMarch of this year I underwent major abdominal surgery, also at Hopkins, to take down a\nfistula and to remove parts of my colon and small intestine. I have been in remission\nsince November and am generally feeling well. I have been back at work since January. \nOver the past year, I have received extraordinary treatment at Johns Hopkins, from a\nmedical team directed by my surgeon, Dr. Ann Beavis, a gynecological oncologist. As\nyou may know, Hopkins is at the cutting edge of cancer research and treatment, but\nmuch more work remains to be done to combat these awful 'below the belt' cancers.. I\nwould be honored and grateful if you would join me on Sunday 7 June, either in running\n(5 k) or walking (1 mile) as part of team #willapower or in making a donation at\nrunsignup.com/willapower. Thank you!",

    "entry": "446 / 1.901\n                       447 / 1.901\nI'm currently having a few health concerns (*just edited this as I had written \"having few\nhealth concerns\" - wishful thinking?), which I indeed hope will turn out to be no more\nthan 'blips.' A third blood workup, this past Monday, following the revelation of extremely\nhigh liver enzyme counts a few weeks ago, has shown these markers to be stable from\nthe last blood test, ie still elevated, less so than the time before -- but stable. So I'll have\nmore blood taken in two more weeks. Meanwhile, as I last reported I believe (?), a\nsonogram of my liver revealed no apparent abnormalities, thankfully. Still, my mind of\ncourse races towards the worst case scenario (cancer in my liver?) while wondering\nabout the persistent ache along my lower right rib cage, in the vicinity, I believe, of my\nliver (gosh, I wish I knew my anatomy better, but as usual since my cancer diagnosis, I'm\ncaught up in an approach/avoidance pattern), At the same time, some persistent\ndiscomfort on my right side -- reminiscent of the discomfort I felt with my fistula (ugh) --\nled me to question whether this is still surgical discomfort (\"your body's been through a\nlot,\" said Dr. Beavis) or something new and unwelcome. And then I read on some\nrandom website that -- TMI alert ahead -- excessive gas (guilty as charged) can be a\nsymptom of ovarian cancer. And *then* I read (or was reminded of? who knows what\nother frightful facts I've blocked out at this point), in an online post by someone\nundergoing OC treatment, that 'high grade serous' OC is both the most common type yet\nalso the one with the lowest survival rate. In any event, all of this led me to recontact Dr.\nFang, my colorectal surgeon, who had not responded to my previous 3-4 emails, leading\nme to retreat in frustration for a while. This time she responded immediately, saying that\na CT-scan was advisable. So back I go for a CT-scan of my abdominal and pelvic areas\nnext Wednesday, in State College. Fingers crossed for a good result. In the meantime, I\nam trying not to \"borrow worries,\" as my aunt Marlene aptly put it.\nIt's amazing how my internal switch can instantly turn me from a (self-perceived)\n'healthy Willa' into 'sick Willa' -- almost Jekyll and Hyde personas. These kinds of 'blips'\nautomatically discombobulate me, switching off my good mood and generally well- (or at\nleast ok-)feeling state and sending me tumbling into bleakness, depression and worst-\ncase scenario land. So I've been bumping around a bit between the two extremes the\npast few days. Ugh.\nToday I was able to pull myself up a good bit, however (or maybe it's just the Lexapro).\nThis morning, I reviewed and then discussed with my wonderful interim department head\n(and friend), B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, all manner of Excel spread sheets and summaries for our budget\nmeeting with the Dean and college CFO next week. Delving into the details and thinking\nahead to the next academic year (and to its possibilities and challenges) actually helped\nme forget about the discomfort in my side. After lunch, Sammi and I set off on an\n'adventure' (or at least what passes for one in these parts), heading about 45 mn out of\nState College on very pretty country roads (large working farms shrouded in mist today)\ntowards Mill Hall (or rather the hamlet of Salona) to a newish Amish market housed in an\n                       448 / 1.901\nold schoolhouse and featuring produce and meat, baked goods, plants, crafts and a flea\nmarket. I bought free range eggs, fresh local asparagus, fresh spinach, dill pickles, and a\npretty planter for the front porch -- all reasonably priced. Unfortunately, a)not everyone\nwas wearing a mask, which made me nervous and b) the market was 'festooned' with\nlarge Trump signs -- all seemingly part and parcel in this rural neck of the woods...\nNevertheless, I am delighted that 'farmers market season' is upon us and think I have by\nnow made most of the dishes one can make with rhubarb -- cobbler, crisp, compote,\nvinaigrette (I guess this weekend, after stocking up at our local Saturday farmers market\ntomorrow, I can produce a pie, cake, chutney or syrup).\nSo if \"it's not time yet\" (a mantra many of my friends and I have been repeating to one\nanother) for travel and other activities, at least we can enjoy the local benefits -- an\nexplosion of produce, great hiking trails, peaceful gurgling streams etc. On Mothers Day\nBen and Sammi cooked me brunch, then we drove out to one of my favorite creeks, past\nmore farms. Sure beats last Mothers Day, which I spent in the hospital. It was very\ncomforting to have my own mother with me that day, but Ben was at a meeting (in\nFlorida, I think). On his return (I was still in the hospital, spent three weeks there, in fact),\nhe gifted me the photo (below) of him running in a half-marathon in Pittsburgh. Beyond\nthe fact that he looks like such a buff, toned, strong, handsome guy (which he is), the\npicture has always spoken to me of perseverance, grit, determination, focus, and\n'moving through:' 'the only way out is through,' something I have often told myself\nduring my own 'marathon.' I love this photo.\nFinally, speaking of running, I am very excited about having formed a team to run/walk\nin the \"Stride and Thrive\" 5k run/1 mile walk on 7 June, a fundraiser for ovarian cancer\nresearch, treatment and survivor support organized by Hopkins. Usually the event is held\nin Baltimore, but as it can't be this year, it is a virtual event. Friends will be running\nwalking here, in Michigan and in Boston and other friends have generously made\ndonations to this great cause (it's not too late to do that and/or to join team\n#willapower); I've ordered #willapower shirts for the runners/walkers.\nAnd this is reminding me that I had set three goals for this summer: to get back to Paris\n(it doesn't look like that's going to happen); to attend the wedding of my friends Maria\nand Greg in the White Mountains of NH (now postponed until next July due to COVID-19)\nand to participate in \"Stride and Thrive\" in Baltimore (now a virtual event). So I'll be\nwalking (I hope...), but in State College. The best laid plans... \nPhotos\n                       449 / 1.901\n                       450 / 1.901\n                       451 / 1.901\n                       452 / 1.901\n                       453 / 1.901\n                       454 / 1.901",

    "entry": "I had hoped to title this entry \"Sometimes a blip is just a blip.\" But no can do. Dr. Beavis\ncalled me yesterday afternoon w/results of the CT-scan I had the other day (reviewed by\na Hopkins radiologist familiar w/my health history). She told me that it looks like I have a\npartial obstruction in my small intestines, which could be causing or compounding some\nof the discomfort I've been feeling in my abdominal area. So -- as when I had a bowel\nobstruction a while back that landed me in the hospital -- I'm on a liquid diet for a few\ndays to see if that helps (currently drinking a mango protein drink). She was relieved to\nknow that I have not been vomiting (I haven't, at all), which would warrant a trip to the\nER.\nMore concerning are a few 'hazy' areas on the scan that *may* indicate a recurrence.\nThey appear to be on my right side and in the rectal area. It is also possible that this is\nscar tissue or inflammation. So I have to have a PET scan, which produces better imaging\nand 'lights up' areas that are cancerous. When I asked her whether she had a hunch\nabout which way this was going to go, she said she really did not, because my CA125\nnumber (ovarian cancer marker), following my last blood test, was sort of borderline\n(upper limits of normal). So I need to have that marker tested again too.\nDr. Fang (colorectal surgeon who operated on me in March) also called me this morning\nto follow up. She again apologized for not responding to several emails I had sent (which\nin my mind may [or may not] have delayed the process that's in motion now); she's been\noperating every day, the hospital is very chaotic w/the advent of the coronavirus etc. I\nam still annoyed that precious time may have been lost, but there's nothing to do about\nit at this point. She said that from the perspective of the last operation everything looks\ngood: the hookup is 'pristine' (her word), no fistula etc. She did concur that my small\nintestines look swollen. She said that Dr. Beavis was 'worried' that I may have a\nrecurrence but said \"We don't have all the information yet, so let's wait until you have\nthe PET scan.\" When I asked her about Dr. Beavis having told me that they saw no\ncancer when they operated on me in March, Dr. Fang reminded me that they would not\nhave been able to see any cancer that was of microscopic size. She (Dr. Fang) also put\nmy mind to rest about some other 'oddities' of my digestive system that I've been\nconcerned about.\nWhen Dr. Beavis brought up the possibility of a recurrence, I was naturally gripped with\nmortal dread, translated into all the physiological symptoms you might see in a horror\nmovie (rapid heart beat, gulping etc.). I felt (and continue to feel, when I think about it)\n                       456 / 1.901\nthat I'm dangling over some sort of black hole. But I was able to calm down some, thanks\nin part to Ben and Sammi's help, and that of my friend Diane, an OC survivor who has\nalso had scar tissue mistaken for something potentially worse on scans. I won't use this\npage to indulge my worst case scenario fantasies, but will simply get on with my day,\nwhich includes two Zoom meetings this morning and then car shopping w/Ben (for me!\nWe thought about putting this off given the recent update, but decided that we'd at least\ngo look and perhaps select what I'd like to buy eventually). It's a beautiful day here.\nShabbat shalom.\nThanks, everyone, for your support. Each of your 'hearts' (both the icons and the real\nones) and your messages is a gift to me. Big love,",

    "entry": "459 / 1.901\n                       460 / 1.901\nThanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good thoughts and/or prayers my\nway tomorrow morning, when I have a PET scan to take a closer look at two 'hazy' spots\nfrom my CT-scan that Dr. Beavis and a Hopkins radiologist are concerned may be\ncancerous. I had blood taken today that will reveal my CA125 number. I received\nnotification nearly immediately that the results of that test are in, and I can likely consult\nthem via the Geisinger portal, but I'm too anxious to do so. I will wait for Dr. Beavis or Dr.\nPatel to share them with me once the PET scan results are also in.\nMeanwhile, though, my crampy stomach ache (resulting from a partially blocked small\nintestine, also noted on my CT scan) is much better, as I've been on a mainly liquid diet\nsince Friday. I still do have that niggling discomfort on my right side, one of the spots\nthat Dr. Beavis is concerned about. It's not at all bad, but it's there.\nMy worst moments emotionally over the weekend took me to strange, often unexpected\nplaces. For the first time, I was feeling frustrated and angry about the whole situation (I\nthink I had forgotten to take my Lexapro that morning, which I now consider essential). I\nhave much too much that I want to accomplish for all this to be happening! It's not fair!\nThere were some weird almost out of body moments when I simply stood still and took\nstock visually of the myriad 'things' surrounding me that make me 'me:' my orchid\nplants, souvenir Eiffel towers on my kitchen table, pretty jewelry that I love wearing etc.\netc.\nNot all the places I journeyed to were sad. I had a very  nice dream about Nightingale-\nBamford, the all-girls school I attended from grade 2 through grade 12: a formative\nexperience, including the friendships forged with my thirty-odd classmates with whom I\nliterally grew up. In the dream, it was the day of the annual NBS fair. I traveled uptown\non the bus (as the adult I am now, but it was the route I took as a girl) to 92nd street and\nMadison. When I got off the bus, I saw little NBS girls in their blue uniforms ('pinnies' or\npleated skirts, like the ones I wore) lining up around the block to enter the school\nbuilding to attend the fair. I also saw, across a broad square that was as large as some\nParisian squares, not like your typical NY crosswalk, my classmates Lisa and Zia waving\nexcitedly at me, yelling something like \"This is the place!\" or \"This is where it all\nhappened,\" or \"It's all here.\" My classmate Eva (something about her both marrying and\nhaving her ears pierced later in life) also appeared in the dream, as did our dear\nclassmate Debbie, my friend since we were six years old, who passed away about three\nyears ago from metastatic breast cancer.\nIn my dream last night, I saw at least one very pretty hamsa (the protective 'hand' that is\nsupposed to ward off the evil eye; I have worn them often as pendants during the past\nyear). This one was very much my style (or one of my styles): Victorian/'chintzy'/floral\nlooking with a pretty Victorian looking heart and flowers worked into it. It looked like it\n                       461 / 1.901\ncould have been made by Michal Negrin, a popular Israeli costume jeweler I like who\noften works Victorian motifs into her pieces.\nDespite my anxiety, I had a pleasant enough weekend and generally feel well. As people\nare venturing out more these days, cautiously, I caught up with both my friend Maria and\nmy friend Gay during strolls in Penn State's arboretum, resplendent right now in purple\nand pink and blue (see pic). Also went to the farmers market (per usual on Saturday\nmorning), TJ Maxx (outdoor plant stands) and drove out to an Amish greenhouse in Brush\nValley.\nI don't know if I mentioned my recent shopping 'rampage.' Unfortunately as I can easily\nsee it becoming a bad habit, I've discovered online shopping during the pandemic. I\nbought several 'big ticket items' -- a bigger t.v. and a t.v. stand, a new office chair and --\nwait for it -- a new car (a 2020 Toyota Corolla SXE in snazzy \"crush metallic blue\" to\nreplace my now sixteen year old Corolla). And then there was a cast iron skillet (I've\nalready made cornbread), a whole mess of makeup from Clinique, Guerlain Mandarine\nBasilic perfume (divine), address labels (needed) and personalized note cards. It was lots\nof fun, but also felt like I was trying to construct some sort of 'bulwark' against whatever\nmight be coming down the road. \"I shop, therefore I am?\" to paraphrase Descartes?\nMy own personal dramas, the sense of the \"time being out of joint,\" are of course\nunfolding against a terrifying fresco of fear and desperation caused by the pandemic,\nrighteous indignation and rage sparked by the (most) recent, blatant examples of\ninjustice and brutality in Minneapolis, and a total leadership vacuum (scarily combined\nwith an abundance of power). While my own fears sometimes run to keeping myself safe\n(cancer + coronavirus = a bad combo), I also worry about how to keep the kids safe (Ben\nand Sammi plan to move to NY this summer, w/Ben starting a grad program in data\nscience at NYU), how to keep my students safe, how to keep the next generations safe.\nThe scenes of looting in my hometown, a few blocks from my mother's apartment, are\nparticularly painful to watch.

    "entry": "Thanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good thoughts and/or prayers my way tomorrow\nmorning, when I have a PET scan to take a closer look at two 'hazy' spots from my CT-scan that Dr.\nBeavis and a Hopkins radiologist are concerned may be cancerous. I had blood taken today that will\nreveal my CA125 number. I received notification nearly immediately that the results of that test are in,\nand I can likely consult them via the Geisinger portal, but I'm too anxious to do so. I will wait for Dr.\nBeavis or Dr. Patel to share them with me once the PET scan results are also in.\nMeanwhile, though, my crampy stomach ache (resulting from a partially blocked small intestine, also\n                       464 / 1.901\nnoted on my CT scan) is much better, as I've been on a mainly liquid diet since Friday. I still do have\nthat niggling discomfort on my right side, one of the spots that Dr. Beavis is concerned about. It's not\nat all bad, but it's there.\nMy worst moments emotionally over the weekend took me to strange, often unexpected places. For\nthe first time, I was feeling frustrated and angry about the whole situation (I think I had forgotten to\ntake my Lexapro that morning, which I now consider essential). I have much too much that I want to\naccomplish for all this to be happening! It's not fair! There were some weird almost out of body\nmoments when I simply stood still and took stock visually of the myriad 'things' surrounding me that\nmake me 'me:' my orchid plants, souvenir Eiffel towers on my kitchen table, pretty jewelry that I love\nwearing etc. etc.\nNot all the places I journeyed to were sad. I had a very  nice dream about Nightingale-Bamford, the\nall-girls school I attended from grade 2 through grade 12: a formative experience, including the\nfriendships forged with my thirty-odd classmates with whom I literally grew up. In the dream, it was\nthe day of the annual NBS fair. I traveled uptown on the bus (as the adult I am now, but it was the\nroute I took as a girl) to 92nd street and Madison. When I got off the bus, I saw little NBS girls in their\nblue uniforms ('pinnies' or pleated skirts, like the ones I wore) lining up around the block to enter the\nschool building to attend the fair. I also saw, across a broad square that was as large as some\nParisian squares, not like your typical NY crosswalk, my classmates Lisa and Zia waving excitedly at\nme, yelling something like \"This is the place!\" or \"This is where it all happened,\" or \"It's all here.\" My\nclassmate Eva (something about her both marrying and having her ears pierced later in life) also\nappeared in the dream, as did our dear classmate Debbie, my friend since we were six years old,\nwho passed away about three years ago from metastatic breast cancer.\nIn my dream last night, I saw at least one very pretty hamsa (the protective 'hand' that is supposed to\nward off the evil eye; I have worn them often as pendants during the past year).

    "entry": "Yesterday's PET scan turned out to be time consuming. I spent three hours at Gray's\nWoods: they were running an hour late, then I had to wait an hour after consuming a\nliquid that makes problem areas 'light up' in the imaging, the actual imaging took awhile,\nand then I had to wait again for them to burn a disc for me so I could send it to Dr.\nBeavis. The scene was somewhat chaotic: as the medical center is undergoing\nconstruction, I was led out back to a *trailer* for the imaging, but the staff was quite\nnice. By the time I was done, I was running late for my 3 p.m. appointment at the car\ndealership, where I spent about an hour with the finance person going over a dizzying\nmountain of information concerning my new car's operation, financing, warranties etc.\nAs I had barely eaten all day (I fasted for the procedure plus was still on a semi-liquid\ndiet to relieve my intestinal blockage) I was pretty much running on fumes by the point\n(and was also radioactive lol). But I did speed off from the dealership in my very snazzy,\nsporty, sexy METALLIC BLUE CRUSH Toyota SXE!\nI spoke to Dr. Beavis for about 45 mn today. I'm detailing what she told me partly to\n                       468 / 1.901\ncement the myriad details in my own mind (she actually asked me to repeat back to her\nthe gist of what she had told me to make sure I understood what she was saying,\nincluding the main takeaways). If this is tmi for you please feel free to skip ahead: She\nsaid that she was \"suspicious but not confirmatory\" of a recurrence, based on the PET\nscan images, which a Hopkins radiologist also read, plus the other evidence from the\nblood work, especially the doubling of the CA125 marker. The areas that lit up on the PET\nscan were around my colon and on my right side, somewhere near both a muscle (don't\nremember the name of it) and my liver. But if there is cancer near my liver, it appears to\nbe on it and not *in* it, which is good. My entire colon lit up, which is unusual, but Dr.\nBeavis thinks that several things may be going on there, not all of them possible cancer\ngrowth (eg inflammation, scar tissue, potential infection etc.). Whatever is going on has\nbeen caught early, also good. So, because nothing with this disease is straightforward, I\nneed now to have two more tests to explore further: an MRI and a stool sample to test\nfor C-diff (a bacterium causing chronic diarrhea, which I have, and colitis). If the MRI, in\nturn, does not prove conclusive, I'll have another CT-scan six weeks after that. \nIf there's been a recurrence, which I'm now expecting there has been, it will mean more\nchemo, either as part of a clinical trial at Hopkins (if I'm eligible), with details re logistics\netc. to be worked out, or here. The drug regimen will be different from the last time, and\napparently I won't lose my hair (ok, I guess I can go get my hair colored now). I really\ndon't know more about that regimen yet (ie length, side effects etc.) as I'll await the next\nround of test results and \"confirmatory\" news.\nI told Dr. Beavis that it seemed to me the cancer had recurred relatively soon: I've been\nNED since last November, ie 6 months. Apparently, a recurrence after six months is\nexactly the tipping point between being \"chemo sensitive\" and \"chemo resistant.\" About\n50% of women fall on each side.\nI also asked her if she thought I could fight this and she said absolutely. If/when I get to\nthe point where she feels chemo will no longer be effective or recommended, she'll let\nme know; but as far as I can tell we're nowhere -- repeat, nowhere -- near there now. She\nreminded me (as I reminded myself) that in the best case scenario ovarian cancer is a\nchronic disease (and I can live with that, no pun intended). I have the most common\ntype, high grade serous, but it's an aggressive type and a small part of my particular\ncancer is particularly aggressive (carcinoma sarcoma). So, for now, more periods of\ntreatment alternating with more 'honeymoon periods' are likely in store.\nI asked her about staging, ie would I be 'demoted' to a stage IV if the cancer has spread\noutside my pelvic cavity. Dr. Beavis told me that with ovarian cancer you never 'budge'\nfrom the stage at which you are diagnosed, in my case IIIC (quite common); you simply\nhave recurrences.\nI felt SO much better after speaking with Dr. Beavis. Not only is she patient, plain-\n                       469 / 1.901\nspeaking, brilliantly skilled, and empathic (while remaining consummately professional).\nBut by virtue of her devising a solid, logical plan along with Dr. Patel, my State College\noncologist, she has also given me *much more hope* along with utter confidence that\nshe is 'on it.' Hence, I've been snatched from the morbid place I found myself yesterday\nwhile my body absorbed the contrast liquid I had to drink before the PET scan: I closed\nmy eyes for an hour and planned the details of my funeral (so at least I can check that\noff my 'to do' list - a bit of gallows humor there :)) as well as last missives and adieux to\nfriends and family. Today I'm back to working, trying out all my new Clinique makeup,\nfixing a batch of rhubarb compote, planning to buy a new couch etc. Physically, I really\ndon't feel badly at all. And mentally/emotionally, I'm back on track. So please get on that\ntrack with me, and not on the pitying/fearful track. Cancer can be scary, especially when\nobserved from the outside I imagine, but once you're 'in it' it simply becomes woven into\nyour the warp and woof of your life.\nAt the same time, I don't deny that, objectively, this whole cancer situation sucks big\ntime. And that I'd rather be in Paris.\nSpeaking of tracks, I'll be walking the track at the Military Museum in Boalsburg this\nSunday with at least part of team #willapower (now fourteen strong and growing). I'm so\ndelighted to have thus far raised over 5K to help women like myself (and the\nphenomenal doctors and staff and Johns Hopkins) and so humbled by the generosity of\nfamily, friends from grade school, college, grad school, colleagues, former graduate and\nundergraduate students (child cancer survivors among them), fellow 'teal sisters' (other\nOC survivors), State College friends and others who have so generously contributed. It's\nnot too late to join/donate (see details in a previous post).",

    "entry": "Here's the medical update: I'm having an MRI on Friday and will have a stool sample\ncollected by mid-week to help Drs. Beavis and Patel confirm or not the diagnosis of a\nrecurrence of my ovarian cancer. Tomorrow I have an appointment with Dr. Patel (and\nport clean), which just happens to be my regularly scheduled, every three month\n'surveillance' appointment. I have a list of questions for him, including: What is\npreventing him and Dr. Beavis from confirming their suspicion of a recurrence at\npresent? What are they on the lookout for? If more chemo is in store, what are the\npotential side effects of the drugs I'll be receiving?\nAnd the thing of it all is that I feel fine. I have some lingering discomfort on my right side\nand my bowels continue to be 'messed up,' which may signal the presence of some\nbacteria (this will be tested). But otherwise, I feel well, physically and mentally (I\ncontinue to worship at the altar of Lexapro). I've been dressing cute, brightening my face\n                       472 / 1.901\nwith the Clinique gelee, chubby stick for cheeks and Sangria lip gloss, and have my first\nmani-pedi in ages booked for next week. Unfortunately, though, cancer couldn't give a\nhoot about such efforts. :( And oh my goodness chemo is debilitating. I am apprehensive\nas hell about being 'felled' once again by the chemo drugs, although I did bounce back.\nWhy was yesterday's Stride and Thrive event one of the best days I've had in a long\ntime, maybe (is this too hyperbolic?) in my life?\n1)I raised over $7K to help fund research, fellowships, and followup treatment for 'below\nthe belt' cancer patients and survivors treated at Hopkins. And that feels fantastic.\n2)Over 90 of my friends and family members contributed to my fundraising efforts. I am\noverwhelmed by the outpouring of generosity not just from those I would expect to\ncontribute but also from many of my former and current graduate students,\nundergraduate students (some of whom wrote touching notes and tributes), friends of\nBen's and their parents, and an adored 'benefactress.' The effort also brought together a\nbeautiful chorus of names and faces from all the 'eras' of my life: grade/high school;\nHarvard (college); NYU (grad school); Penn State/State College; others. Former grad\nstudents ran for me in Michigan and North Carolina and Philly; dear college friends\ndedicated their runs to me in New Hampshire and Baltimore and Tokyo, while a grad\nschool bestie and my dear PSU department colleagues also walked in my honor (and\nsent pics!); my brother and family, meanwhile, bedecked themselves in #willapower\n'gear' (swag? I guess I'm a brand now...) for their walk in Riverside Park. There is good in\nthe world! I know (I just changed this from: \"I have to imagine...\" No. I *know*) that all\nthese dear folks care about me and/or care about combating cancer. And that feels\nfantastic.\n3) I am grateful that I still have the 'stuff,' ie the organizational chops, motivating force\n(ie #willapower), creativity (#willapower t-shirts!), energy, commitment, and\npurposefulness to pull something like this off. Our team came in sixth in fundraising\nefforts out of forty teams. And we won the spirit award from the organizers (always the\n'model student,' no surprise I'm gunning for being the model cancer survivor/fundraiser\n:) )\n4) A gorgeous day; a great group of local women including two of my dear \"teal\nsisters\"/'IIICs' (I was delighted to introduce each of them to one another, w/one result\nbeing that we may now be morphing into a social walking group, at the suggestion of\none of my friends); an invigorating walk around the pretty grounds of the Military\nMuseum in Boalsburg; a fit, smiling and kind group of five young adults (including Ben,\nAlex and Nikhil, buddies since kindergarten - a precious scene beholding these strapping\nyoung men of 25 along with their wonderful girlfriends Sammi and Julia), setting off to\nrun a 5K along a route Ben had devised; a post-walk/run coffee in the sun at the Pump\nStation Cafe and relaxed lingering on this glorious Sunday morning. The fun and\n                       473 / 1.901\nfellowship and good vibes felt strong enough to elbow out a deadly disease, at least for a\nbit. And that felt fantastic.\n5)A community of survivors and caregivers emerging throughout the day from the\nlivestreamed opening and closing ceremonies in Baltimore (the event was virtual this\nyear) and from a steady stream of photos and videos posted on social media. Dozens of\nsurvivors, each with her own journey. Several women 'liked' my FB/Instagram posts, a\nfew 'friended' me. I am one of them, I am not alone, and it felt empowering. As I said to\nmy friends in State College when we split up after our time together: \"Next year in\nBaltimore.\" And THAT felt fantastic.

    "entry": "As several friends have reached out to me with much caring for an update following my\nvisit with Dr. Patel yesterday, here's a brief one for now: we had a good visit in that he\nspent quite a bit of time with me and seemed completely on top of how everything has\nevolved in the past few months. We also had a very candid conversation about how I\nmight approach work-life balance and, in that context, quality of life issues going\nforward, which I very much appreciated.\nHe admitted he was 'confounded' by the abnormal liver function numbers (but guess\nwhat folks? I had more blood taken yesterday and now my liver numbers are completely\n                       479 / 1.901\nnormal, an encouraging sign). [Btw, the other recent 'better news' that I forgot to\nmention in a recent post is that the partial blockage of my small intestine, which was\ncausing me belly aches, has resolved. A few days on a liquid diet did the trick].\nDr. Patel feels that I am headed towards more treatment, given the corroborating\nevidence from the bloodwork (CA125 number has doubled) and imaging (CT and PET\nscans). I'm not sure whether it was Dr. Beavis who pushed for another round of imaging\n[mistakenly wrote 'imagining' - ha] (ie MRI), but in any event it will allow the doctors to\ntake a closer look at what's going on inside my pelvic cavity. It is not clear where exactly\nthe cancer on my right side might be (muscle? on the liver? lymph node? duct?). The MRI\nimaging might provide a clearer idea.\nIf I have more chemo it will take place once a month, for an unspecified duration,\ncombined with regular testing of my blood (and maybe scans?) to assess the\neffectiveness of the treatment. The drug regimen is carboplatin (which I took last time)\nand doxil (which I didn't). Dr. Patel seemed to feel the side effects would not be too bad,\nbut I'll reserve judgment for now and think positive. One effect might be 'hand-foot\nsyndrome' (some sort of rash on hands and feet). Another might be cardiotoxicity\n((in)ability of heart to pump blood well and/or damage to heart muscle); this is what I\nneed to know more about, because it sounds worrisome. I hope he didn't gloss over this\nrisk... He sent me off to have an echocardiogram (like a sonogram of my heart), to make\nsure, I guess, that my heart is functioning well, which it is (and may it continue to).\nChemo could start next week. Whatever they are detecting has been caught early. There\nare no big masses or anything like that.\nWhile I'm nervous about the side effect I just mentioned, I am currently feeling *fine*\n(well, in fact). After a two-day freak out I described in a previous post, I am feeling strong\nand resolute, mainly after convos w/some key players (Dr. Beavis, my fellow survivor\nfriends, family). I was told to expect a recurrence from day 1, and at least one of my\nsurvivor friends here in State College is doing well twelve years out after at least four\nrecurrences.\nOnwards to definitive (?) confirmation of a recurrence once my oncologists will have read\nmy MRI results, probably Friday or Monday. If their read is, once more, not definitive, Dr.\nBeavis suggested we'd do another CT-scan in six weeks. \nI realize that it's been over a year since I began writing this journal. In a future post I\nhope to write about that fact, including my thoughts on what kind of 'narrative structure'\nI could ever hope to impose on -- or see emerge from -- the events of the past year\n(Bildungsroman? Picaresque novel? Odyssey?). For now, all that's coming to me is: it's\nbeen one big, dizzying SWIRL. \n  \n                       480 / 1.901",

    "entry": "481 / 1.901\n                       482 / 1.901\nWell, the MRI, as not unexpected, confirmed a recurrence. I could tell that Dr. Beavis was\nwaiting a bit to let that news sink in before we continued the rest of our 45 minute\nteleconference yesterday. As always, she was *perfect* - calm, clear in her explanations,\npatient, caring. She said my bright purple turban looked great on me (it's hiding a mop of\nunruly gray hair that will be 'tamed' next week). She explained that the MRI picked up\n3-4 small (1 cm or less) 'implants' on (not in, which is good) my colon. There may well be\nother, microscopic bits of cancer in other areas (like on my side, near my liver) but the\nMRI did not pick them up and the upcoming chemo will target them too. The colon is a\ntypical place for a recurrence of ovarian cancer. As I likely explained when I dealt with\n'first line' chemo, something that might be compared to 'dandelion fluff' blew off the\ncancerous ovaries (now removed, of course) and landed on other nearby areas of my\npelvic and abdominal cavities. That is why I had to have a small piece of my liver\nremoved during my ginormous debulking surgery last May. And please remember,\neveryone, what I've written several times: OC is, in Dr. Beavis' words, a \"chronic\nrelapsing condition.\" A recurrence was always expected, although I'm still a bit surprised\nit showed up so soon. I asked Dr. Beavis if that is an indicator for future recurrences and\nshe said that usually *less* time elapses between successive  recurrences. However, she\nis not at all certain this will be my case because I had several complicating factors --\ninfection, fistula -- during the first go-around. She suspects that the cancer on the colon\n*may* be related to some of my current digestive/bowel troubles. The fact that the\nimplants/tumors are small is good; chemo tends to be more effective on a number of\nsmall amounts of cancer in one location as opposed to bigger masses in several places.\nIt is also good that no cancer was detected in or near my lungs, which would mean that\nthe cancer had traveled through the blood stream, which would be (really) not good.\nEqually bad, I think, would be cancer found to have penetrated inside organs.\nNevertheless, the thought of insidious, stealthy cancer cells attacking me from within is\nscary indeed.\nMore chemo is in my near future. I'll have six rounds, one every four weeks, with a CT\nscan after rounds three and six and my CA125 number tested every round. I am likely\nnot eligible for the clinical trial at Hopkins that Dr. Beavis had mentioned. The drug\nregimen I'll receive will consist of carboplatin and doxil. Dr. Beavis says that most people\ntolerate a second round better (each session will also be shorter than the last time, when\nchemo was almost a full-day activity). I might develop a rash on my feet and hands, I\nmight possibly develop an allergy to the drugs, and I have a *1%* chance of developing\na heart problem. Apparently my hair won't fall out. As for nausea, vomiting, fatigue - who\nknows? I'll take all of it *as long as the drugs are effective,* which is my foremost wish.\nUnfortunately, no one can be with me in the chemo room, due to COVID. That's a\nbummer for sure, but it's ok too.\nWe talked a good bit about work. As I currently have no idea of how this round of\n                       483 / 1.901\ntreatment will affect me, it's hard to make decisions and plans. However, with the help of\ncolleagues I'm trying to figure out some contingency plans that will allow me to acquit\nmy responsibilities and do the work I enjoy doing while having firm backup plans in\nplace. And it seems even more imperative to me than before that I'll likely need to work\nfrom home, to protect myself from a potential chemo/Covid whammy. Penn State's plans\nfor reopening are complicated, but I presume they will include provisions for people with\nunderlying/complicating conditions.\nSo now I have to wait for my insurance company to pre-certify my treatment. Dr. Patel's\nnurse said this could take 7-10 days! Aargh! And I need to meet with Dr. Patel\nbeforehand to further discuss the treatment and its potential side effects. So this delay\nlikely suits my approach/avoidance m.o., but the 'approach' side of my brain tells me\nthat we need to get this show on the road. 'Onwards,' as I said to Dr. Beavis yesterday --\nwith a sigh.\n...and did I mention that I feel and look FINE?\nAfter I spoke w/Dr. Beavis, I went out for a walk to process the news. As I passed my\nfavorite, just-blooming gingko tree I found myself blurting out loud, to no one in\nparticular: \"My world is shrinking!\" The daughter of one of my best friends in France is\ngetting married in Burgundy on 2 August. I'd love to go, but Americans may not even be\nallowed into France before mid-July and then will likely have to quarantine. And now\nthere is my vulnerable immune system to consider. So that part of my 'world' that is in\nFrance -- a big part, in fact -- seems more and more like a mirage. I very much want to\nget away for a few days before school starts, w/a strong preference for a place I can plop\nmyself down on the beach w/a few novels. \"See how you're feeling after a few rounds,\"\nsaid Dr. Beavis. \"So....much....uncertainty...,\" I said to her, sighing (again). \"I really wish I\ncould provide more certainty,\" she replied, empathically. \"But unfortunately I can't.\"\nAs usually happens, I'm feeling more chipper today, having slept better last night than\nthe one before. I had a very productive work day, making good progress on both my\nVever editing and an article (about food, of all things...). Went to farmers market\n(rhubarb, strawberries, zucchini, melon) and will make something tasty for dessert\ntomorrow at a friend's house. I took a peaceful drive out into the countryside on Sunday\nin my new car (moon roof open all the way; soul music on Sirius); so gorgeous here in\nJune (see pic). Amish kids were having fun on their kick scooters while the older ones\nwere taking their buggies out for a spin.\nThanks for your dms, texts, emails and calls of concern. Thank you for walking with me\non this challenging road. Grateful that Ben and Sammi will be here for two (?) more\nmonths (!) before moving to NY.  So grateful for my support network. I will continue to\nlean into it. \n  \n                       484 / 1.901",

I arrived promptly at 9:45 mentally and\nphysically prepared, lunch in one tote bag, other supplies (hand cream, ear buds, book,\nstationery for thank you notes, ratty pink PSU hoodie I always wear during chemo) in a\nsecond. I had blood drawn and saw the nurse to check vitals. Unfortunately, though,\nwhen I then met Dr. Patel, I balked at the fact that he had not resolved with Dr. Beavis\nwhether or not I should receive Neulasta (white blood cell booster) after my treatment,\nas I had after my previous treatment, which began last summer. He had said previously\nthat I would not (it turns out that Neulasta is not always used with this particular drug\nregimen), yet I was fairly certain Dr. Beavis had recommended it (indeed she had, in this\ncase, because of COVID). And *I had written to both of them beforehand, asking them to\nplease resolve the issue between themselves before my first treatment.* They had not\ndone this. And my additional 'read' on the situation was that Dr. Patel didn't want to get\ninto the weeds with my insurance company over whether or not the Neulasta would be\ncovered. So he hadn't contacted Aetna. And he didn't seem to me to have a solid\ncontingency plan in the event that my infection-fighting white blood cells dropped\nsignificantly after treatment. As I was getting a bit agitated, he finally said \"Let's play it\nsafe\" (thank you.....) by (his) requesting precertification for Neulasta from Aetna. But this\nmeans waiting until early next week for chemo to start. \nDr. Patel's office manager apologized to me for not having had this resolved before\ntoday.\n....and did I mention that a woman in Dr. Patel's waiting room was hacking away with a\ndeep chest cough?

    "entry": "I made it through round 1, but not without a complication. A piece of good news is that\nmy blood counts looked fine. One of those troublesome liver marker numbers has come\ndown into the normal range, the other is a bit elevated still but not far off normal. White\nand red blood cell counts, platelet count etc. all look good. Based on that encouraging\nreport, we were able to proceed to chemo.\nSince my last stint in the chemo room (July-Nov. 2019), now due to COVID, no visitors,\nhand-holders or milkshake-bringers are allowed in. It's very quiet in there. It feels a bit\nlonely w/out the company, but I managed (wrote thank you notes, sent texts) and the\nentire treatment is shorter this time (2 hours total, but actually about an hour longer if\nyou count the blood work and then waiting for the results). I know the nurses by now,\nand some of them are really nice, caring. And thankfully there were no vociferous\nTrumpiacs or other trouble-makers to contend with.\n1/2 hour of fluids (glucose solution) - check. 1/2 hour of carboplatin - smooth sailing. 1\nhour of doxil (the new drug for me) - about 5 minutes into it I began to feel distinctly\nunwell. Flushed, light headed, my chest started constricting and I began to feel searing\npain in my back, seemingly along the sides of my spinal cord. I believe the nurse was\nright next to me (frankly, I don't recall) but I managed to mumble something like \"I...\ndon't...feel... well\" and just remember blurting out a string of epithets to deal w/the\nincreasing pain. Luckily, the nurses sprung right into action with the emergency protocol,\ntesting my bp and oxygen (both plummeting rapidly), pumping me with steroids and\nbenadryl, and letting me know that what they were doing would reverse the allergic\nreaction. Dr. Patel also rushed in immediately and began checking my pulse, heart rate,\nlungs etc. Fortunately, they were able to get the reaction under control pretty quickly, at\nwhich point I was sort of loopy from the meds. We waited about 25 mn. then restarted\nthe doxil, this time with no complication for the rest of the hour. It was quite scary, but\nthe anti-allergy meds kicked in so quickly and almost knocked me out completely so my\nfright response was quickly tempered. And the nurses were on it, thankfully; if not, it\ncould have been much worse. I suppose I'll have to receive those meds now every time. I\nhad been told that an allergic reaction was possible but it apparently doesn't happen\nthat often with doxil. Again, my bottom line is: may the chemo work! (May the force be\nwith me, in other words!).\nI was so zonked when I got home around 5 p.m. (my neighbor Janis kindly took me to\nand from, with a pit stop at Meyers dairy afterwards for the now ritual during or post-\nchemo milkshake) that I slept for an hour or so, then heated up some tomato basil orzo\n                       494 / 1.901\nsoup (courtesy of Wegman's) and crashed in front of the tv, where I've become\nengrossed in the Israeli series (on Netflix), Shtisel. Between watching the tube longer\nthan I should have, some additional screen time, getting involved in a lighthearted text\nexchange with a friend, and still being somewhat agitated from the day's events - and\ndespite having all that Benadryl in me -- I had much trouble sleeping and only squeezed\nin a few hours. Will try to correct that tonight with an earlier bedtime and less screen\ntime.My wonderful friend Helen brought me not only a delicious lunch (chicken salad\nbowl - lots of good protein) but also a \"Nourishing and Brightening Oil Sheet Mask\"\n(100% Camellia), which seems exactly what's needed tonight.\nI feel tired today and mildly nauseous (am taking anti-nausea meds) but not too bad\nreally, all things considered. I've had a relaxing day writing thank you notes (close to 100\ndonors to my cancer fundraiser, so it's taking a while but I'm getting there!) and\nresponding to emails. So far I'm not feeling anything like the crushing fatigue that I had\nlast time around. Ditto for any of the ghastly doxil-related symptoms (skin turning brown,\nmouth sores etc.) that women write about on a Facebook page that seems to trade in\ncatastrophizing and hysteria (and misspellings) so I try to stay off it, even though there\nare kernels of helpful info mixed in. Much more useful to me are the carefully curated\npostings of the Hopkins' Kelly Gyneologic Oncology Service, where I am grateful to be a\npatient.\nOff now to get a shot of udenyca, a Neulasta biosimilar that will help boost my white\nblood cell count. This is the shot that I nearly had to sell my firstborn for in order to have\nmy insurance company cover, so it better work!\nSabbath peace to all, and love. Many thanks for the chorus of support.

    "entry": "I understand that my post-chemo pattern now will likely entail a rough weekend followed\nby gradual recovery, unless the rounds become increasingly hard for me to handle (last\ntime, in July-Nov., some rounds seemed to hit me harder than others). On the whole,\nthough - and for the time being - this go-around does not seem as debilitating as the last\none. So far, no crushing fatigue, no seventeen-hour sleeps, no needing to lie down every\ntime I pass my bed. The day after chemo I took it easy, but had no problem showering\nand getting dressed, making breakfast, shooting off a bunch of emails and staying up\nuntil my normal bedtime these days of about 10 p.m. Ditto for the following days - over\nthe weekend, I shopped at the farmers market, took a long country drive, went clothes\nshopping, whipped up a beet and goat cheese salad and some garlic scape pesto etc.\nAnd today I had a pretty much normal work day, making some progress on two projects,\nattending to correspondence etc. \nMy symptoms have included fatigue (I can feel 'in my bones' that my body is craving\nsleep), nausea (not debilitating, abating each day, and handled with Zofran and\nCompazine), mild headache, some tenderness in my neck (perhaps lymph nodes?) and\nneuropathy in my toes and, mildly, in my fingers. I must be very vigilant when I get out\nof bed at night or simply rise from a sitting position so as not to lose my balance and fall,\nas I did in January, resulting in a broken bone in my ankle. And last night I noticed that\none of my big toenails appeared to be 'jiggling' a bit, loosely. Then I remembered that\nchemo can adversely affect finger and toe nails (I wrote Dr. Patel's nurse to see what she\nrecommends but have not heard back yet; of course I fear infection if the tissue becomes\nexposed). I also remembered all the awful, undignified, sci-fi-ish side effects that chemo\ncan provoke. Losing my hair was of course the one that most made me feel like some\nsort of alien; whether or not it will happen this time is unclear. Thinking positively, I have\nan appointment with my hair stylist Sarah tomorrow for the first time in almost four\nmonths! I cannot wait. My hair has grown in curly so we'll see what she can help me\n                       497 / 1.901\ncome up with.\nMy mood has been generally ok, not super-buoyant but fine, with some teary moments\nusually late at night, first thing in the morning or in the shower. I was veering towards\nself-pity (never a constructive emotion for me), imagining that people were starting to\nthink of me as \"doomed girl\" (aka \"recurrence girl\") or, conversely, \"heroic girl\" (an\nequally pressured role to fill). I got out from under that cloud pretty quickly, somehow.\nAs ever, texts, msgs and emails from friends and family help immensely, even if I can't\n*see* most of these folks (very hard, more on that another time). My OC-survivor friend\nDeb reminded me in a msg today that treatment for her several recurrences (and\nzapping the cancer early each time) has given her twelve years of good quality of life so\nfar. Hopefully, I'll be able to get out for a socially distanced walk or coffee with a friend or\ntwo this week, and there's a nice lunch on the horizon too. And Ben and Sammi are back\nfrom D.C., having completed Phase 1 (getting their stuff out of their D.C. apartments) of\ntheir move to NY in August. They are quarantining for a few days at Michael and Sue's,\nand took a COVID test as well, simply as a precaution because they've been away from\nState College for a while. I expect they are fine, but it will be a few more days until they\ncan stay here. We're already, though, formulating some holiday weekend plans to get\nout to one of the pretty state parks nearby for some kayaking or canoeing, picnicking\netc. I would love to eat a grilled hot dog.\nOn Wednesday I'll be (re)passed the baton for the department headship. Obviously we're\nat a critical juncture right now working to help implement Penn State's plan for\nreopening in August. I'll be working from home and will have backup on hand from\ntrusted colleagues if needed.\nMay you live in interesting times.",

    "entry": "I haven't written in a while. That is both because all is well for now and because I've\nbeen very busy with headship business -- in particular, making sure all of our\ninternational students can remain in the States following the very draconian and\ninhumane directive from ICE targeting them. It feels good to be busy, useful, helpful. I'm\n                       499 / 1.901\ncautiously optimistic that I made the right decision returning to the headship -- as long\nas my health remains stable. Right now, I feel pretty well overall. My energy is good, my\nappetite healthy, I'm sleeping well on the whole and I think I look ok. The week after\nchemo, I didn't feel great but in the three weeks after that I really rebounded\nimpressively. My stomach and digestive system have a mind (and nervous system) of\ntheir own and always seem to be a bit 'off.' I guess that's what happens when you say\ngoodbye to two parts of your colon and two of your small intestine.\nI feel so well, in fact, that on Wednesday, rather spontaneously, I'm going on vacation! I\nhave not been out of Dodge, except for treatment (read: surgery) at Hopkins since\nDecember, when I was in NY and on a wonderful retreat with three of my best women\nfriends at Kripalu Yoga Center in the Berkshires. I'm heading back to MA, this time to the\nCape! I have been craving the ocean (seeing it, bathing in it, maybe doing some yoga by\nit, reading something engrossing with my toes dipped in the water etc.). One of my best\ntravel buddies, Ben, enthusiastically agreed to come with me. We took him to the Cape\nwhen he was little, but he doesn't remember it. We're staying in a wonderful hotel with\nlots of amenities, the Chatham Bars Inn, which I fell in love with ten years ago during a\nfun stay at the home of a college friend in Chatham. My friend Denise and I took a walk\naround the property at that time and sat on some comfy lawn chairs out front. The hotel\nhas a private beach, a pool, several restaurants, fitness center, and spa (have already\nbooked a facial and manicure). I'm hoping for lots of beach and pool time, some drives to\nnearby towns, walks and lots of reading (I have two books lined up and am trying to\nsettle on a few others), plus some yummy seafood. I will be careful, but my stomach\ntolerates fish quite well, and I don't see how a lobster roll - or two - could do harm - just\nneed to avoid fried and/or spicy stuff and alcohol (does not mix well w/my chemo) - well,\nmaybe just one fried clam will be ok.\nAny suggestions for a book on tape and/or good podcast for the long drive there and\nback, which Ben and I will split? \nOtherwise, the summer days have proceeded tranquilly (well, except for the continually\nworrisome backdrop of COVID and national politics; still we live in a peaceful little bubble\nhere). I've been working hard, doing a lot of cooking and baking, getting out for walks,\nwatching Netflix, reading, seeing a few friends here and there and keeping in touch with\nmany others. I fully realize that all of this could turn on a dime, though -- I could have a\nbad reaction to my next chemo or, worse, the chemo might turn out not to be effective\n(a scan in about two months, plus bloodwork before that should reveal any telltale\nsigns). It is possible, then, that while I calmly go about my business cancer cells might be\ncontinuing to multiply and spread. So...much...uncertainty. But my default mode is\npositive thinking and savoring the moment or, as my friend David Rothman (who knows\nof what he speaks...) puts it, squeezing each drop of sweetness out of every moment as\nif it were a cell of honeycomb.\n                       500 / 1.901\nSammi and Ben found a rental apartment in Park Slope and will be moving in mid-\nAugust. I will miss those two tremendously, but it's time for them to get on with the next\nphase of their lives. Ben may, in the end, wind up taking all his courses at NYU online\nand Sammi will continue to work remotely, but at least they'll be 'launched.' Nice that\nthe whole immediate family will be in NY. I'm missing the city, but I suspect that the vibe\nmight seem unfamiliar these days...\nAs it was my father's yahrzeit last Friday (three years), I virtually attended service so I\ncould say kaddish. The rabbi offered a somewhat differently worded version of the\nprayer for healing than the one I'm used to, and it resonated with me. The prayer invited\n\"healing, strength and enlivening\" to *surge* (apt verb) both \"towards and within me,\"\ninvesting me with \"spirit, holiness and continuing possibilities.\" I think we also sang the\nDebbie Friedman version of the \"Mi Shebeirach\" (prayer for healing) that asks a higher\npower to \"help us find the *courage* to make our lives a blessing.\" Sometimes it does\nindeed take *courage* to make our lives a blessing; one cannot be passive about this\nendeavor - at least not in my experience.\nBack on the 21st, just in time for chemo on the 22nd.

    "entry": "I would like to share a bit about our wonderful week on Cape Cod, but thought it best to\nfirst share a health update. We arrived home (after a nine-hour trip from MA, with Ben\ndoing perhaps 2/3 of the driving and me 1/3) late Tuesday night and I was at Dr. Patel's\noffice for chemo the next morning (fortunately having benefited from a good night's\nsleep, as I was exhausted on our return).\nPer the normal routine, I had my blood work done first, to make sure that none of the\nresults would prevent me from receiving chemo. My hemoglobin was a bit low (expected)\nand my liver markers still a bit elevated (their erratic nature is still an unresolved\nmystery to me), but not enough to warrant holding off on chemo. The CA125 (OC\nmarker) result usually comes in the next morning. My vitals were all fine; I seem to have\ngained a few pounds, had to be those lobster rolls...\nI had a good meeting with Dr. Patel and feel closer to him now than initially. I sense a\ngenuine concern on his part and feel that he is finally 'seeing' me as the total person I\nam. He seemed quite on top of my treatment, and said he felt I was \"doing well,\"\nperhaps in part because I am so active and have not recently (or ever, really)\nexperienced any worrisome symptoms like vomiting, blood in stool, headaches, falls etc.\nMy stomach remains a bit quirky but may have settled down a bit recently. It feels 'stiff'\nin the morning (likely due to adhesions), but after I move around a bit it feels more\nsupple.\nI was of course concerned that I might have another allergic reaction to the chemo\ndrugs, as I did last time, but the nurse pumped me full of Benadryl ahead of the\ntreatment and I was fine. My nurse, who came over (temporarily or permanently) from a\nGeisinger center in Lewistown, seemed to be having lots of trouble with the equipment --\nor perhaps the equipment was simply faulty (or perhaps she was a bit faulty...). Every\n5-10 minutes or so it would start beeping and she had to restart it, perhaps because of\nair bubbles in the tubing through which I receive the chemo drugs. Then she knocked\nover a very large tray of medical equipment that clattered noisily to the floor. This really\nstarted stressing me out and added a lot of extra time to the treatment. Oh well.\nNevertheless, I got through it and my friend Helen kindly picked me up, with the now\ntraditional vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy in hand. My caring neighbor Janis had\ndriven me to chemo in the morning.\nUnfortunately, I slept poorly last night: a bout of nausea woke me up at one point and I\nwas fretting over my soon to be revealed CA125 number, which I'm always highly\n                       504 / 1.901\nanxious about uncovering (either through Geisinger's online portal or via Dr. Patel). So I\nwas immensely relieved to learn (via the portal) that my CA number had decreased from\n50 last time to 31.2 this time, putting me back within normal range (at the somewhat\nhigher end of normal, but definitely *normal*). Dr. Patel wrote me to say that this\ngradual trending down was encouraging. It makes me hopeful that my treatment is\nworking, which is my bottom line hope. I'll know more when I have my CT-scan at the\nmidway point after round three, in late August.\nToday I returned to Dr. Patel's office for my shot of Udenyca (a Neulasta biosimilar),\nwhich boosts white blood cell count. I don't mean to complain, but the (same) nurse did\nnot inspire confidence. She could not pronounce the name of the medication, making me\nunsure if I was receiving the same medication as last time. She had me look at her\ncomputer screen to see if I could pronounce it. And once again she seemed not to be\nable to operate the equipment, this time to take my blood pressure. Like yesterday, she\nwas stressing about this (getting flustered and sighing heavily) and that was in turn\nmaking me nervous. I will follow up with the nurse manager to let her know that since I\nfeel so vulnerable before and during treatment, it's crucial for me that the staff remain\ncalm, composed, skillful and confident. The Udenyca can cause bone pain, so soon I will\ntake a Claritin, which can help counteract that potential side effect.\nToday I feel tired (from the treatment itself and the poor sleep following) and very mildly\nnauseous, but am thankful not yet to have experienced any other pernicious side effects\nof Carboplatin and Doxil: bad rash on hands and feet, mouth sores, a worsening of\nneuropathy (fairly bad in my toes already), and in rare cases, heart problems. Despite\nmy fatigue, I had the stamina to spend the day responding to and writing emails that had\npiled up during my vacation -- during which I made the decision to keep work at bay to\nthe extent possible so that I could recharge for a week.\nMy latest Netflix obsession is a documentary series called \"Lenox Hill,\" which follows the\nlives of several doctors at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. It is very sensitively done, and\nthe stories are compelling. One of the doctors is an experienced neurosurgeon, Mitch,\nwho in the course of the series is diagnosed, ironically, with advanced neck cancer, ie a\ntype of cancer familiar to him from his specialty. Aside from not sharing an iota of this\ndoctor's professional expertise, I found myself relating to him intensely on a personal\nlevel, from his telling his associates, when he reveals his sobering diagnosis to them,\nthat he doesn't want a 'pity party' or even sympathy, to a poignant scene where he\nattends an annual retreat with the other neurosurgeons (about five of them, all men), at\nthe weekend home of one of the doctors (looked perhaps to be on the Long Island\nshore). The guys sit around drinking, casually dressed, fishing poles and tackle scattered\nabout -- the bond and the love among them is palpable, as is their desire to marshal all\ntheir expertise to help their colleague (who in the end may not want treatment because\nit would likely involve removing part of his *face* traversed by a major vein). In any\nevent, surrounded by his friends/colleagues, Mitch is clearly in the 'be in the moment,\n                       505 / 1.901\nlive every day to the fullest' mode, and says something like \"and this day has been \ngreat.\" I found myself fist-pumping the air and just yelling: \"YES!\" It's amazing how low\nmy threshold for happiness is these days. Any day that I wake up alive, feeling\nreasonably well, and able to work and pursue most of my normal activities, I am simply\necstatic.\nMore on the vacay when I'm able. Thanks to many friends who remembered I had chemo\ntoday (I don't even remember sharing the day with many of you!) and checked in w/me\nvia message or text. I am so touched. I appreciate your care. It uplifts me.",

After two post-chemo days\n(Thursday/Friday) feeling relatively chipper -- I put in a good eight-hour work day on\nFriday, including attending a tense department heads'/deans' meeting devoted to plans\nfor Penn State's reopening next month -- the weekend's been rough. In a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all\nover again\" scenario reminiscent of last summer (and not in a good way), I fell asleep for\nseveral hours on the couch in the late afternoon two days in a row, awaking at 8:30 p.m.\n(and I'm not a napper....). I still felt tired after a ten-hour sleep last night and thus ceded\nto the temptation to get back into bed to snooze some more after late breakfast. The\nfamiliar fatigue-nausea combo has beset me, accompanied by an upset stomach, loss of\nappetite, some tenderness in my neck etc. UGH. My physical weakness tends in turn to\nfrustrate and depress me (that niggling feeling that I should be up and about, or working,\nor simply doing something compounded with missing friends and family not in State\nCollege when I'm feeling low). As I've found from previous experience, though, in the end\nI simply need to give in to the fatigue. I am taking anti-nausea meds, meds for my upset\nstomach, Claritin for potential bone pain, and a Tylenol here and there for headache --\nand I'm trying to stay well hydrated. Ben and Sammi were kind enough to grocery shop\nfor me and water my plants. And a gorgeous bouquet from my mother's best childhood\nfriend and her son, plus another lovely bouquet that Ben and Sammi brought back from\na friend's garden in Pittsburgh, were well timed to lift my spirits. Ditto for a few\nmessages exchanged with friends, always part of the cure. Hoping that I'll start\nrebounding soon. \nHard to imagine that I felt so energetic during our vacation on Cape Cod, including the\nnine-hour drive to and from. That gives me hope. It was a memorable, relaxing, lovely\nweek at the Chatham Bars Inn- just perfect. Weather was a bit mixed. Surrounded by\nmagnificent hydrangeas and lulled by a gentle, fragrant sea breeze, we spent entire days\nat the pool (where I dug into a few fun reads, _French like Moi,_ by a colleague, Scott\nCarpenter, and _L'Appart_ by one of my fave American French food gurus, David\nLeibovitz); indulged in the great seafood purveyed by casual shacks along the coast\n(fried clam bellies! clam chowder! lobster roll! fish tacos! oysters! fish sandwiches!);\nwalked to the sweet town of Chatham for a blueberry muffin, juice and coffee each\nmorning; took a day trip to Provincetown. Ben golfed (including with one of his best buds\nfrom State College, who now lives in Boston, and his girlfriend) while I swam in the spa's\nprivate pool, followed by a facial one day and a manicure the other (three different hand\ntreatments!). Our room was spacious with high-grade bed linens, a lovely view of the golf\ncourse etc. It was all very much an indulgence in terms of how I usually travel, but as it's\nostensibly my only vacation this summer I decided to splurge. And I'm definitely in that\ncarpe diem mode. I had a great, totally sympatico time with one of my favorite travel\ncompanions, and we had a belly laugh watching seagulls swooping down to devour the\nexpensive poolside lunch just bought by a couple sitting next to us.\n                       508 / 1.901\n[Btw, the hotel was quite COVID-safe -- as safe as one can be these days, I imagine --\nand everyone seemed to be adhering to regulations about masking and distancing. While\nwe did take off our masks at the pool and when dining outdoors, we seem to have\nreturned healthy. I certainly hope so].\nAs I had the luxury of some unstructured time to allow my mind to wander \"where it will\ngo,\" I found myself trying to figure out what constitutes a perfect day for me (I even\nbrought this up to Ben, but as he's sometimes a man of few[er] words his answer was\nsuccinct: golf). I settled on the following: my perfect day involves an out of the ordinary\nspace-time continuum. Time is 'elastic' and just flows. There is usually some movement\nthrough space (ie a long walk or several activities in a day that seem to flow naturally\nfrom one into another). There's always at least one other person involved, perhaps a\ndear friend. And nature and the weather cooperate. One example would be the very long\nwalk I have taken for many years on arriving in Paris during the summer -- most often\nwith my dear grad school friend Randy, but it could also be with my equally dear college\nfriend Mitchel (or both of them - or any number of friends). It's a ritual that has\nmaintained its spontaneity. We meet up in the Marais for brunch or coffee and then just\ntake off walking around Paris, stopping perhaps in the Tuileries to sit and chat by a\ngorgeous reflecting pond, then checking out a show in a gallery that we come upon, then\nit's time for a cold drink or maybe an ice cream or gelato, then more walking (we'll sit in\none of those adorable little parks that dot Paris), talking, sharing, laughing, gossiping,\ncatching up, people watching, window shopping until all of a sudden the day's coming to\na close and it's time for an ap\u00e9ritif and maybe a falafel before we part ways. What is so\nperfect about these perfect days? The flow and the harmony, the feeling of well-being\nand happiness. And equally as perfect, as Montaigne famously puts it in his essay, \"De\nl'Amiti\u00e9\" (\"On Friendship\"), is the following: \"parce que c'\u00e9tait lui, parce que c'\u00e9tait moi\"\n(\"Because it was he*, because it was me\").

    "entry": "514 / 1.901\n                       515 / 1.901\nI suppose I'm motivated to write more than I've been doing recently when I'm in crisis\nmode. But happily things have, overall, been good recently (let's leave aside my\nconsternation over the state of the country - and the world). A few weeks removed from\nmy last round of chemo and feeling well, I'm trying to squeeze every ounce of time and\nenergy, for both work and play, out of these 'good' weeks, with round 3 -- debilitating\nlike all the others, no doubt -- coming into view on August 20th. Work is of course really\nheating up with the start of the semester just two+ weeks away. So I'm trying to keep on\ntop of all the department head, admin work (usually in the mornings), then switch to\nsome combination of preparing my fall graduate seminar and my own research in the\nafternoons. So far, I'm afloat. And feeling productive and useful = feeling upbeat. And\nmy energy level this week has been good, as I try very hard to get the sleep I need.\nFurther, I enjoyed three lovely lunches with friends this week (all of them at the Ale\nHouse, where one can dine on a pleasant shaded outdoor deck), and have a visit with a\nfriend and a morning walk with three other friends to look forward to tomorrow (this new,\nwelcome 'tradition' grew out of the June 'Stride and Thrive' cancer walk for which I\norganized a team; it was so much fun that several of us now meet up once a month for a\nwalk, gabbing and post-walk refreshments - #willapower t-shirts optional!). I've bought\noutdoor chairs, some decorative planters, and a colorful orange, yellow and blue Mexican\noilcloth tablecloth for my little back patio, so for the first time I can really use it for\nentertaining.\nBen and Sammi will come over tomorrow and stay until they leave for NY next Saturday.\nBen's just returned from a golf vacation in Michigan with his dad. He will have been here\nsince March 16th and Sammi since April 4th. Oh I'm going to miss those two... Well,\nmaybe more on that another day.\nRecently, the myth of Sisyphus came to mind in relation to my own condition. I\nremember reading the text by Camus in high school French class I believe. We spent\nhours in class debating the meaning of it, which seemed so very 'heavy' to my sixteen-\nor so-year-old self. While I don't feel at all as if, like Sisyphus, I've been 'punished' by the\ngods or any other power (chalk my cancer up to just plain 'ole bad luck, a random\ncellular mutation), I can relate to Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the mountain, almost\nreaching the top, only to have it come crashing down again. Then I remembered -- and it\nresonated with me as I contemplate my own 'Sisyphean' fate -- the final line of Camus'\ntext, summing up Sisyphus' paradoxical combination of acceptance of his fate and yet\nrebellion against it. \"Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux.\" Yes, \"one must imagine Sisyphus\nhappy.\"",

    "entry": "517 / 1.901\n                       518 / 1.901\nBen and Sammi left this morning at 5:30 a.m., after five months here as my 'quarantine\nroommates.' I miss them and feel emotionally exhausted today. Their presence was a\nblessing and the silver lining in the midst of the COVID gloom, turning our home into a\nhappy, harmonious cocoon. I will simply miss having them *around:* an early riser, Ben\nwould always be working in my study when I rolled out of bed around 8:00; he'd come\ninto the kitchen (where I had transferred my work station) c. 10:00 to make himself\nbreakfast; we'd often share a quick bite together at lunchtime. Sammi would return from\nworking at Michael and Sue's around 6:00. I'd start preparing dinner around 7:00 or so,\noften with the kids' help (my passion for cooking and baking has been reactivated over\nthe past five months as I loved cooking for all of us; we'll see what happens going\nforward). We'd enjoy a lovely dinnertime together and then Ben and Sammi would\nfaithfully clear the table, wash the dishes and tidy the kitchen while I crashed in front of\nthe t.v. or went for a walk. Before 10 Ben would come into the t.v. room to say\ngoodnight, leaning his head down so I could plant a kiss on its top. It was wonderful too\nto spend so much quality time with Sammi, whether around the house, driving out to an\nAmish market in the countryside or discussing how to spruce up my t.v. room and back\npatio (both of which I made good strides on this summer, thanks to Sammi's sharp\ndesign sense). They were both also great helpers to me, not only keeping the kitchen\nneat but lending a hand with grocery shopping, assembling a new t.v. stand, figuring out\nwhich type of new car I should buy, getting me set up with a better internet server,\noccasionally preparing me a gin and tonic (I scarcely drink these days), and of course\npitching in when I was wiped out after chemo. [They're] leaving home, bye bye...\nI suppose I should have learned by now, from having cancer, that impermanence is a a\nfact of life, but having them leave is still hard. Yet I also feel immensely grateful!\nAfter Ben and Sammi left at 5:30 this morning (Ben came into my room to give me a\nfinal hug w/those long strong arms of his), I fell asleep again and had an extremely\ninvolved dream about my college reunion, the details of which I won't recount now. Next\nyear is slated to be my 40th but it's going to be virtual. I feel sad about this too, because\nit's been a huge uplift to reconnect 'in the flesh' with my college classmates at five year\nintervals, although I see and/or am in touch with many of them more often.\nI slept in, went to the farmers market, and in the afternoon took a relaxing drive out into\nthe countryside -- buggies, cows, farms, farmstands (where I bought peaches and dill\npickles), rolling hills -- and way too many Trump signs (and a Confederate flag......) for\nmy taste (I did spot one Biden sign). I love driving my new car while blaring (windows\nclosed, a/c on) and singing along to my tunes.\nFortunately -- I suppose -- I have plenty of work to keep me busy with school starting the\nweek after next. I really can't conceive of what it will be like to conduct the entirety of\n                       519 / 1.901\nmy work from home and am apprehensive about getting lonely, or feeling like I'm\ndrifting away from all the forms of sociability I'm used to etc. I know that I'll need to have\nregular get-togethers (walks, outdoor coffees and lunches etc. for as long as the weather\nstays nice) with friends to keep myself sane. I am also a bit apprehensive about staying\non top of things work-wise during the 'bad' week following chemo (my next round is this\ncoming Thursday), but I've been discussing ways of keeping this manageable with\nfriends and family. I also need to be 'ok' with not giving 120% at least (as I'm used to\ndoing), if I'm unable to. This is a difficult reality for me to face as I've always been so\ndriven in terms of work, but there may be days when I simply have to ease up on the gas\npedal. I'm thinking of setting up a meditation area in Ben's bedroom upstairs. On the\nother hand, I am glad to be productive, working, helping, connecting, flexing my\ncreativity (when not mired in administrative minutia). I've been feeling well the past\nthree weeks or so but with chemo (and then likely a CT scan and possible\nechocardiogram) looming, that boulder's likely going to come rolling down that hill again.\nI've already tentatively programmed in ample rest next weekend should I need it before\nschool starts. And I'm of course praying I won't have to deal with any 'curveballs' in\nterms of my health. I continue to be very well surrounded -- another blessing. Two\nfriends checked in on me today, intuiting that I'd be sad after B and S's departure (they\nare safely in Brooklyn now, and Ben has scouted out a 'real deal' Brooklyn pizza joint for\ntheir dinner). One friend proposed a walk tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it. \nShavua tov ---\nPhotos\n                       520 / 1.901\n                       521 / 1.901\n                       522 / 1.901",

    "entry": "Just a quick update before I go make dinner. Everything went smoothly with today's\ntreatment. My wonderful friend Helen picked my up bright and early (before 8:00 a.m.)\nand it was lovely to be able to enjoy her company for the short drive to the Geisinger\nmedical facility. We joked that we had both made the effort to put on make up and dress\nnicely for each other :). I had blood drawn, which I then reviewed with Dr. Patel. Some\ncounts were slightly high (liver markers) or low (hemoglobin) but overall things looked ok\nand there was nothing so out of range as to delay treatment. Tomorrow I'll learn what\nmy CA125 number is and pray that it will have decreased even more from 31.2 (normal)\nor else will have remained stable; if it went up since last time, I'd feel worried. We looked\nat the results of my last PET (I believe) scan (maybe it was a CT scan) and saw the spots\non my liver and in a lymph node that we are targeting during this round of treatment.\nThat image was a rather sobering reality check and draws me temporarily back into that\ndark place where cancer reigns. It was simply an 'UGH' moment. I'll have a PET scan\nsoon as we're at the halfway mark and it's appropriate to take a look inside and see if\nthe cancer has regressed (hope so). My vital signs were very good (100% oxygen rate,\ngood blood pressure on the lower side, weight around 130 lbs, which is a weight that\nfeels very comfortable and healthy for me). Dr. Patel said: \"You're doing good.\"\nTreatment went smoothly and took about three hours. The nurse again pumped me up\nwith Benadryl to prevent another allergic reaction to Doxil; that immediately made me\nquite drowsy. Then I received an anti-nausea drug, then Carbo followed by Doxil. Smooth\nsailing. I mainly texted friends and family and, as ever, was extremely grateful for check\nins and well wishes (thank you mom, Ethan, Ben, Helen, Jackie, Gay, Maria, Clare -- and if\nI've missed anyone please excuse me in my grogginess). My kind neighbor Janis picked\nme up and she knew to drive me right to Meyers Dairy for the now ritual post-chemo\nmilkshake (chocolate toasted almond - so good and refreshing and comforting). I was\nvery tired when I got home so I crashed (ie slept!) for about two hours, then sat outside\nin the delightful 'back to school' weather, then wrote a bunch of work emails. Now I'm\ngoing to make dinner (likely some haddock and zucchini and taboul\u00e9. My potassium is\nlow so I need to stock up on bananas, melon, raisins, etc.\nTomorrow I hope I won't be too tired to make it to my hair stylist's for a 9:30\nappointment. Then at 2:00 I have to return to Dr. Patel's for a shot to boost my white\n                       524 / 1.901\nblood count, after which I'll go down the hall to my dermatologist's to have stitches\nremoved from my head (she had biopsied tissue from a bump on my head that, as she\nsuspected, turned out to be benign - whew - from a pilar cyst). Exciting, eh?\nThe weekend will pose the challenge of needing to rest as much as possible combined\nwith needing to keep up with admin./head work to the extent possible and polish off my\nsyllabus and prepare for graduate seminar on the Dreyfus Affair on Tuesday evening (I\nfeel like the class part is in pretty good shape; almost done w/syllabus, have been\nthinking a lot about format of first session and what I want to say). I need to avoid stress\nbut I'm also happy to feel purposeful and productive. So I'm praying that the chemo\neffects aren't too harsh but there's no guarantee. Based on the first two rounds, I can\nexpect acute fatigue, nausea, body aches, cramps etc. Praying that mouth sores, bad\nrash don't kick in. Good wishes, good karma, prayers, mantras all welcome going\nforward.",

    "entry": "The weekend's been rather rough, as predicted. Saturday morning I woke up with the\nnow familiar body aches. It seems like every part of my body is sore to the touch, even\nmy head. My neck, arms, ribs etc. all seem sort of puffy and sensitive and it hurts just to\nmove. Otherwise, I have some relatively mild nausea and significant fatigue, which I tried\nto combat by getting at least nine hours sleep both Saturday and Sunday night and lying\ndown a few times during the day. Today my body feels no worse (although it doesn't feel\ndistinctly better either) and I'm hoping tomorrow I might start to turn the corner\n(incidentally, I never learned my CA125 number on Friday so I hope -- and don't hope --\nthat that test result comes in tomorrow). I laid low at home over the weekend, enjoyed a\nmocha chip milkshake my friend Jackie was kind enough to bring me, watched Netflix\n(_Father Soldier Son,_ a sobering NYTimes documentary), and worked calmly in my\noffice, which turned out to be fairly relaxing. I had to detach when I began stressing over\na frustrating hour spent trying to scan documents, fruitlessly.\nI felt anxious knowing that despite my discomfort I had to try to push through to finish up\nmy syllabus and prepare a number of admin. tasks for the beginning of this week, as our\nsemester starts tomorrow. And goodness knows I'm not the best organized nor the most\nefficient admin., but I did make an effort to get as far as I could this weekend. This\nmeans that I will have the morning tomorrow to deal with whatever headship stuff might\narise, and then the afternoon to prepare my class for Tuesday evening; I've already\ngiven the first session a good bit of thought, so I just need to sit down and chart it out.\nTuesday morning we have our College heads and deans meeting. I'm still wagering on\nthe notion that feeling productive and purposeful will actually be good for me, as long as\nI stay calm and healthy. Maybe I just want sympathy. We'll see.\nI had quite the back to school anxiety dream last night, this one likely compounded by\n                       526 / 1.901\nthe fact that I have in fact been out of the classroom for an entire year, including a\nmedical leave last fall. In this dream, I had returned to wrap up an undergraduate class\nfor the last session. I had missed the second to last session without letting the students\nknow where I was, and apparently in my absence things had gone downhill (in reality, I\n*did* miss the second to last session of my undergrad class in Spring 2019, because I\nwas in Danville meeting with a gynecological oncologist; my wonderful intern took the\nclass for me that day and I think some of the students were concerned about my sudden\nabsence). In any event, when I got to the class I felt that I needed to let the students\nknow where I had been, so in my best 'teacher voice' (ie volume pumped way up), I\nexplained to them that I had been travelling to Russia, Germany and Iceland. I was sort\nof gesturing aimlessly into the air as I was saying this (almost expounding on it) -- but\nnone of them were listening to me; I was completely irrelevant. The students were slated\nto do group presentations that day, so I tried to get that going, knowing that we would\nnot have time to complete all the presentations and not having really figured out a\nsolution (perhaps I thought vaguely about having them come do the presentations for\nme at another time). We were in some sort of space that gradually became darker and\nmurky looking, with a strange glow. I could hardly see the students, but they seemed to\nbe interacting with another. One of the group presentations was about Gyp, the author I\nwrote my dissertation about whom I'm also incorporating into my Dreyfus Affair seminar\nthis fall. It had an almost surreal or fairy tale quality about it, with the strange glowing\nlight and flashes of gold in whatever space we were in. End of dream.\nIn this 'plague season,' I've had a number of dreams about travel. Dreams are wishes...\nHoping and expecting a more successful first class than in my dream, I'm taking the\nevening off to chill and will get back to work tomorrow.",

    "entry": "531 / 1.901\n                       532 / 1.901\nI haven't written in a while. The first three weeks of school have sped by and I'm caught\nup in the frenzied pace. My graduate seminar on the Dreyfus Affair appears to be going\nwell. I'm certainly enjoying it - and the students -- and feel energized to be teaching\nagain after a year away from the (now virtual) classroom. While admittedly the first\nnearly three-hour session (5:30-8:15 p.m.) drained me physically, last night I still felt\nenergetic enough afterwards to cook dinner (and then to plunk down in front of the t.v.,\nonly to watch an utterly saddening Frontline focusing on three children living in poverty\nwith single mothers, navigating the pandemic, mothers' job losses, and the impact of the\nBlack Lives Matter movement).\nIt's a stressful time to be an administrator. The number of COVID-positive cases\ncontinues to rise alarmingly on our campus, which means that colleagues have been\nconfronted with cases in their own classes, and I need to help our faculty navigate these\ncrises. I often have to supply data to the College (for example, about the modes --\nremote, in person, mixed -- in which our classes will be taught next semester) on very\nshort notice. Major budget cutbacks are looming, in the Libraries for example, but not\njust there. We anticipate a poor academic job market for our graduate students this year.\nAnd campus and town just seem so ..... quiet. Being able to do all my work from home is,\non the one hand, a privilege and time-saver yet it also makes 'community building'\nwithin our department harder, to say the least. At times I feel isolated but otherwise I'm\ngrateful to be 'in the mix,' 'in the room where it happens' (to quote from _Hamilton_).\nAnd it heartens me to try to be helpful, to work with students and colleagues to help\nthem achieve goals, to move the department forward, hopefully, even in these stressful,\nstraitened circumstances. And even while combating cancer. Maybe I'm like Paris,\naccording to her motto: Fluctuat nec mergitur/She is tossed by the waves, but does not\nsink.\nI certainly felt tossed by a 'wave' today at 6:20 a.m., when I dragged myself out of bed\nthe morning after teaching my three-hour seminar (when I usually let myself sleep just a\nbit later) to commence what turned out to be a six-hour stretch of tests (and prep for\nthem)  -- my mid-cycle check to see if/how the chemo is working. I've already found out,\nvia Dr. Patel, that this morning's echocardiogram shows \"normal cardiac function.\" Thank\nheavens, as there was always the risk, while slim, that this combo of chemo drugs could\ndamage my heart. I see (just now) that the results of my PET scan are in as well, but I'm\nway too nervous to look at them, and I often need the results translated into laywoman's\nterms, and interpreted for me (is cancer making quick work of me? or do I have reason to\nfeel encouraged?). For this brief moment, ignorance is bliss. I'll wait until tomorrow to\nhave Dr. Patel (and perhaps Dr. Beavis, if I can get her the imaging tomorrow) parse the\nscan results for me. Amazingly, I had a bit of energy to work when I got home, and will\ndo the same tomorrow while taking it fairly easy (easily?).\n                       533 / 1.901\nOverall, I'm feeling pretty well. Energy level is good. My stomach continues to be 'wonky'\n-- the new normal after removal of two pieces of my colon and two of my small intestine?\nMy hair has grown back -- curly! It's healthy-feeling.\nI needed a day to recharge last weekend so I took all of Saturday off -- took a lovely\nwalk/talk in the arboretum (pic attached) w/my friend Maria followed by dinner at Barrel\n21 (the long, relaxing gab fest did me a lot of good). Sunday I visited with my friends Mar\nand Jessica in their beautiful backyard, then enjoyed lunch on Monday (a generally\n'laboring' Labor Day for me) with my friend Kathryn in the peaceful outdoor oasis of the\nAle House. It's imperative for my sanity -- and being the extrovert that I am -- that I see\nfriends 'in the flesh' (outdoors and masked for the most part) from time to time -- no\navatars, no icons, no simulacra.

    "entry": "Thrilled to share the news below - \"encouraging,\" indeed! Thank you, potentially heart-\ndamaging, nausea- , neuropathy- and body ache-inducing yet ultimately life- sustaining\ntoxins for doing your work! I've been granted yet another 'reprieve,' and though chemo\ncontinues (next week in fact), I am breathing a bit easier and even allowing myself to\nfeel somewhat hopeful -- for now.  After thanking God (or a higher power) abundantly, I\nhad two thoughts, simultaneously: what can I treat myself to to celebrate this great\nnews (I've been eyeing longingly for some time a few gorgeous rings by Dell Fox, a\nSanta Fe jeweler I discovered when Ben and I visited [there's a wacky story behind this\nvisit] and then there is Tiffany... AND how can I pay forward the tremendous gift I've\nreceived today? I have an idea or two.\nDr. Beavis has not looked at the scans, but I forwarded Dr. Patel's note to her. I asked\nto have a disc made for me and was told it would be ready today, but when I got to\nGray's Woods -- no disc, no dice. Ugh! But it's a minor inconvenience. I'll return\ntomorrow.\n                       535 / 1.901\nEvery day a blessing.\n___\nI reviewed your PET-CT scan done on 9/9/2020:\n- Previously noted right pelvic lymph node showed interval decrease in the size and\nmetabolic activity. Now it is measuring around 7 mm. (It was around 1.2 x 0.8 cm in the\nprevious imaging study). More importantly activity has gone down significantly, SUV\nwas around 12.3 earlier, now it is around 4.25 suggest good response with the\nchemotherapy.\n- Previously noted metabolic focus close to the right hepatic hilum is no longer seen.\n- No other new suspicious findings noted anywhere else.\nOverall encouraging PET-CT scan findings noted. Will go over with her regarding the\nimages when I see you on 9/17/2020.\nNilesh A. Patel, MD\nHematology/Oncology",

    "entry": "Chemo went smoothly today. My kindhearted neighbor Janis drove me to the Geisinger\nmedical offices before 8:30, and my equally kindhearted, dear friend Helen picked me up\nat 1:15, Meyers mocha chip milkshake in hand (love to have the cool, creamy goodness\nmassage my insides, the chips providing just the right amount of texture, and by 1:15 I\nwas hungry!). Per routine, I had blood taken, then headed downstairs to Dr. Patel's. Per\nmy own private ritual, I haven't yet looked too closely at my bloodwork numbers (if they\nhad been out of whack Dr. Patel would have cancelled today's chemo treatment),\nincluding my telltale CA125 number. Frankly, it takes a lot of mental/physical energy for\nme just to gear up for chemo, so I'll hope that Dr. Patel will share the numbers and his\ninterpretation of them tomorrow. Vitals all fine, thankfully. Dr. Patel showed me the\nimaging from my last two PET scans and I could see that cancerous activity in the two\nareas of concern - a lymph node in my pelvic area and on the exterior of my liver -- has\ndecreased. I asked whether the same holds true for the colon, which had been identified\nto me as the primary area of recurrence; he told me that the colon is harder to see on\nthe PET-scan but since activity in the other areas has decreased he presumes the same\nholds true for the colon. No other cancerous areas noted, specifically in the lungs and/or\nthe bones -- which would be bad news.\nOf course, he reiterated to me - when I queried him on this - that eliminating all the\ncancer cells is virtually impossible. They are lurking and will continue to do so. So that's\nthe less good news. But the better news is that I'm feeling generally pretty well, my\n                       538 / 1.901\nenergy is good (put in a 10-hour work day the other day), and this treatment appears to\nbe effective -- so much so, in fact, that Dr. Patel may propose three more rounds of it\nafter I finish the six initially prescribed. Past nine rounds, he says that I may start to\nexperience a worsening of my neuropathy -- already bad in my toes, which feel numb all\nthe time (leading to a fall in Jan. resulting in a broken ankle), but thank goodness not in\nmy fingers, essential 'tools' for my work. He'll talk to Dr. Beavis and I'll see what kind of\nplan they come up with. I trust them. Dr. Patel now seems much warmer towards me --\nwe joked about how he's a terrible typist because his father encouraged him to learn\nlanguages instead and I learned that both his parents live with him and his family.\n\"You're doing very well,\" were his parting words.\nThe Benadryl drip made me so tired today that, without the benefit of morning coffee to\nboot, I dozed during chemo, which wasn't unpleasant. My favorite nurse, Tracy, took\ngood care of me, and we chatted about the challenges of online teaching/learning for her\ntwo high-school aged sons and my own graduate students. And I had an additional 'mini-\nsnooze' when I got home, then went to a local farm stand to pick up some Honeycrisp\napples (my favorite) to make chicken salad (from the chicken soup I made last night),\nplums (I'm thinking compote), zucchini (to stuff sometime soon) and a decorative\npumpkin. On the way home I stopped at Lupita's a great local, authentic Mexican joint in\na Unimart, to pick up some paletas (ice pops in enticing flavor like walnut and coconut).\nI've spent the past few hours answering/writing work emails.\nMy French colleague and friend Dominique Kalifa took his own life a few days ago, on his\n63rd birthday. Devastating, shocking news. He had written a chillingly elliptic message --\n\"Au Revoir\" - on his Facebook and Twitter accounts right beforehand (like others, I\nimagined he was taking a social media break). A renowned, pathbreaking historian, he\nwas always incredibly generous to me, inviting me to speak in his seminar at the\nSorbonne and to contribute an essay to his last edited volume; writing a long review of\nmy latest book in the French mass daily newspaper, Lib\u00e9ration; and taking time to\nbrainstorm with me about my research. He was brilliant, charming, and had a wonderful\nability to federate colleagues from all over the world in a spirit of professional and\nhuman exchange. Conjecture about the cause of his suicide has been making the rounds\namong my friends/colleagues; no need to repeat it here. In trying to have even the\ndimmest idea of 'why' -- from the outside he seemed to lead a charmed life, full of\nworldwide travel, friends, prestigious acknowledgements of his work etc. -- I know that I\ntoo, have at certain points in my life, have experienced so much psychic pain that I\nsimply wanted it to *stop.* I've also had to make a few decisions (fortunately not many)\nthat I *knew* were going to hurt the people I loved most, yet I willfully chose to put my\nown needs first. Given my own life situation right now, though, it is at the same time\nvery difficult for me to understand Dominique's act (this being said, I certainly do *not*\njudge it). I'm fighting to stay alive, and am doing just about everything in my power to\n*will(a)* both maximal quantity and quality of life. A strong survival instinct seems\nhardwired in me right now (and in me generally, I would say...). And the love and support\n                       539 / 1.901\nof family and friends is, in itself, more than enough to keep me firmly *here.* Of course, I\nmay/might evaluate this differently when/if I get to a very bleak point medically. But I'm\nnowhere near there. So I keep on fighting. \"Reviens tr\u00e8s vite parmi nous\" (\"Come back to\nus [in Paris] very quickly\") Dominique wrote me when I emailed him about my cancer.\nCaring words. I wish I could say the same to him, but I can't.\nOn a more positive note, I was delighted to welcome Vinni, my bff from graduate school\n(and Professor of French at Wellesley College), to my graduate seminar Tuesday night\nfor a most interesting Zoom talk. We have strongly intersecting research interests, as we\nhave had since grad school at NYU, and we've collaborated on many conference panels\nand publications over the years. It was so much fun to team up with my friend of nearly\n40 years again. \"We have to carry on the torch,\" I wrote her after Dominique's death.\nAnd now Ben has started his M.S. program at NYU. The circle of life. Round like the round\nchallah I hope will arrive from Zabar's tomorrow in time for erev Rosh Hashanah\ntomorrow night (yes, I splurged big time on some 'the real deal' eats). \nI will try to write another update tomorrow. \nThanks for your well wishes, everyone.\nLove, Willa",

    "entry": "This is the second New Year I've been able to welcome in since my \"alive day\" last May. \nSo -- and because I'm a bit rushed right now getting ready for the holiday -- I will, for the\nfirst time, post a 'reprint' from last 29 September. So much has changed since then.\nCOVID has upended our lives - irrevocably? My mother and I have enjoyed many a Rosh\nHashanah here together: she comes up to State College, we cook up a storm, go to\nservices followed by a nice lunch, then tashlich, marked by a pleasant stroll in Walnut\nCreek Park with other congregants. This year I'm solo -- I'm sad to be without my family,\nbut I'm ok. And traditions must continue! Last year, as I recall, I felt very worn out (I was\nundergoing my first course of chemo) but still managed to whip up a brisket with\npomegranate sauce. This year I'm feeling stronger -- undergoing \"second line\" treatment\nfor a recurrence, but I seem to be responding quite well. No hair loss, better energy,\nworking full time. I had chemo yesterday but still had ample energy to make chicken\nsoup, honey cakes and a plum compote w/vanilla and cardamon. For the rest of the meal\nI splurged and ordered a big boxload of goodies from Zabar's -- matzah balls, chopped\nliver, herring in cream sauce, noodle pudding, gefilte fish and a round challah (a lovely\nfellow congregant also brought me a round challah today - so kind of her).  I think I'll\ndress cute, putting on a new skirt I ordered from Anne-Elisabeth in Paris, my favorite\nshop for clothes.  At 8 I'll Zoom into services w/my congregation; ditto for tomorrow\nmorning. And if I have the energy (I often go into a post-chemo crash after two days), I'll\nperform tashlich beside one of our pretty local streams.  I hope I can make it.\nI am fine. And I received the good news this morning that my CA125 level has dropped\ntwo more points, to 17 from 19 - still trending in a good direction. I think I'll have a glass\nof wine to celebrate the birthday of the world. Let's hope for a better 5781 than the year\nbefore. We need it.\nBlessings to all.\nLast year's post:\nToday is the birthday of the world, Jewish tradition teaches, a time of renewal and hope\nfor the year ahead. We've fully entered the month of elul, which coincides with early\nautumn, and the \"Days of Awe:\" Rosh Hashanah, on which our fate for the new year is\nwritten, and Yom Kippur, on which it is is sealed. Our lives are depicted as being in the\nbalance during these days before the 'gates close:' \"who shall live to a ripe old age and\n                       541 / 1.901\nwho shall lie dying on a bed of pain?\" It's an existential state; we're truly 'on the narrow\nbridge.' We beat our chests as we catalog the sins that we've been guilty of the past\nyear. Yet we are told that teshuvah (repentence or return), tefillah (prayer) and tzedakah\n(charity) can temper the harshness of God's decree.\nHaving had to confront my own mortality over the past few months, the spiritual side of\nmy journey has come into fuller relief, including during the holidays. I'll welcome the\nopportunity at dinner tonight, while blessing a round challah, symbol of the cycle of life,\nand later at services, to tap into feelings of hopefulness, renewal, and immanence. To\nEmily Dickinson, hope is \"the thing with feathers-/That perches in the soul-\" that can be\nheard in \"the chillest land-/And on the strangest Sea-\" I've indeed felt glimmers of hope\nin the 'chillest land' and 'strangest Sea' where I've found myself struggling over the past\nfew months. As for my fate, it surely lies somewhere at the intersection of the designs of\nsome nasty, aggressive, microscopic cancer cells, the skills of my medical team, and my\nown fighting spirit. \nI am spiritual, yet agnostic. I apologize if this offends any believers who may be reading\nthis. But I do firmly believe in the manifestation of 'godly' qualities in people, animals,\nand nature, whether it be loving kindness, graciousness, mercifulness, or compassion. I\nhave seen these attributes displayed time and time again since my diagnosis, whether\nthrough friends coming to spend time with me, text or call me, send me thoughtful gifts,\nvolunteer to do errands for me, cook for me, drive me to Baltimore, or just 'hold space'\nfor me. It is quite wondrous. \nIt is a wonderful holiday this year because my mother and Ben are here. My mother and I\nhave been cooking up a storm; I'm not quite sure how I managed to pull it off as at the\nbeginning of the week I was completely wiped out from chemo, but I was searing brisket\nand frying onions in pomegranate molasses early this morning. I was hoping that Ben\nmight take some interest in the holiday cooking (he certainly does in the eating), as I'm\nnot sure who will continue the culinary traditions after my mother and me.",

By Saturday, my post-chemo crash was in high gear, per usual:\nexhaustion, nausea, headache, stomach ache (beginning of a stomach blockage? hope\nnot -- two hospitalizations on that score were more than enough for me), entire body\nsensitive to the touch (and not in a good way; pained me even to touch my head lightly).\nEvery time I walked past my bed, it seemed, I had to crash, missing out on most of some\nbeautiful days. Ditto Sunday, although the fatigue and feeling crappy became layered\nover w/stress as I dug into my heavy workload for the week. Today's just slightly better.\nThe body aches are not as intense, but I've had a headache all day and nausea that\ncaused some vomiting, which actually made me feel better. Chicken soup is the only\nfood that appeals. Luckily I was able to cry my eyes out to my therapist online - combo of\nfeeling crappy, work stress, being physically alone for the holiday, social media overload\nfollowing RBG's death, and pandemic-induced isolation all feel overwhelming today. \nWhen I say that chemo 'went well,' what I mean by that is that I had no repeat of the\nhorrifying allergic reaction that sent my blood pressure and heart rate plummeting a few\ntreatments ago, as my chest constricted rapidly. It means that I succeeded in\nsummoning the psychic energy to allow toxins to penetrate my body for several hours. It\nmeans that I accept that the treatment is melting away some cancer cells but leaving\nothers lurking, to cause their ravaging damage at will. It means I didn't spend all night\nvomiting into a trash can.\nPlease understand the herculean effort involved in being a cancer patient, especially as I\ntry to do a credible job with my work, my mothering, being a friend, and with all the\nother things I do. Even for one as practiced as myself in 'pulling it all off' artfully and\ngraciously, it's not easy by any means.\nPhotos\n                       545 / 1.901\n                       546 / 1.901\n                       547 / 1.901\n                       548 / 1.901",

    "entry": "Who shall live and who shall die,\nWho shall reach the end of his days and who shall not,\nWho shall perish by water and who by fire,\nWho by sword and who by wild beast,\nWho by famine and who by thirst,\nWho by earthquake and who by plague,\nWho by strangulation and who by stoning,\nWho shall have rest and who shall wander,\nWho shall be at peace and who shall be pursued,\nWho shall be at rest and who shall be tormented,\nWho shall be exalted and who shall be brought low,\nWho shall become rich and who shall be impoverished.\nI don't have time to write at length as I'd like to, as I'm readying for Kol Nidre, but this core prayer from the\nYom Kippur liturgy has of course had special resonance for me the past two holidays, and it has always seemed\nominous to me. My life's in the balance tonight. Call me a bad Jew, though, but I know it can't all be in God's\n                       551 / 1.901\nhands (those cancer cells have a mind of their own). And while we're taught that study of Torah/prayer,\nrepentance, and charity can temper God's harsh decree, I'm hoping that living a virtuous, meaningful life\ndefined in my own terms will be its own reward. On this day of atonement, though, I did write a friend who I\nknow I hurt recently through my words and actions. I'm hoping they'll realize that my intentions were good, but\nthat I mishandled a delicate situation and acted maladroitly. The blessing is that they told me I had hurt them,\npaving the way for a not entirely pleasant but productive path back towards one another.\nWho shall live and who shall die? While I've had a not great week health-wise -- something if off w/my\ndigestion and a nearly a week of a liquid diet has not seemed to help so I'll be calling my doctors again\ntomorrow -- my gut (no pun intended) tells me that I'll still be here next year. Again, not to take anything away\nfrom the Almighty but rather just acknowledging the realistic odds and my recent good response to this round of\nchemo. I won't be fasting, of course (although in essence I am!), because of my health, but I'll still hope to clear\nout a good mental space for contemplation over the next day and a half.\nMore when I have time. Now where did I put my tallit?",

    "entry": "553 / 1.901\nI'm just emerging from what I hope is a health blip (and nothing worse), which\nnevertheless landed me in the ER for most of Tuesday. I had mentioned, I believe, that\nsince a few days after my last chemo treatment, my intestines and stomach had been\nfeeling 'wonky,' as they often do.  I'm sure it's somehow related to the lingering issues\nfrom this past March's fistula repair surgery. The symptoms are not pleasant, but they\nfelt reminiscent of my three previous intestinal blockages, two of which resulted in\nhospital stays and one of which I was able to resolve on my own by observing a liquid\ndiet and massaging my abdomen. On Dr. Beavis' advice I recommenced a liquid diet,\nwhich didn't really seem to alleviate the symptoms. Further, I began to feel quite weak\nfrom not eating (although I tried to ingest some high-calorie liquids like milkshakes) and \nquickly dropped about six pounds. I also had agonizing leg and foot cramps at night,\nfrom being dehydrated (even though I was drinking as much as I could) and low on\npotassium. One night the cramps woke me up about once an hour -- torturous. Each time\nI had to do some combination of walking around, applying a heating pad, and massaging\nthe cramped area until the cramp(s) resolved. By the time the last cramp shot me out of\nbed at around 6 a.m. I was so exhausted and in so much pain that I broke into a cold\nsweat, vomited a few times, and just crumpled on my bed, with that Carrie Underwood\ncountry song going through my head: \"Jesus, take the wheel.\" Je n'en pouvais plus.\nMonday I called my PCP, Dr. Damaske, hoping he could see me, but he was also booked.\nI also called Dr. Beavis, who said she'd place an order for me to have an abdominal X-\nray. The order wasn't ready when I called Hopkins and in fact was never emailed to me.\nThe next morning, my PCP's office called to see how I was doing and to say that Dr.\nDamaske suggested I go immediately to the ER (which Dr. Patel had suggested as well),\nto make sure I didn't have a blockage (which needless to say, if it bursts, can be\nextremely serious). I powered through an important monthly meeting of deans and\ndepartment heads, to be followed by a second department heads meeting for our School\nof Global Languages, Literatures and Cultures. By the time I got to that meeting and was\ntelling one of my colleagues (also a cancer survivor) that I wasn't feeling great, he and\nthe other school heads began urging me to skip our meeting and go straight to the ER.\nSo I did.\nMy kind neighbor Janis drove me to the ER. I had packed a bag with a few days' worth of\nclothes and my laptop, as I fully expected to be admitted for a blockage and was\nanticipating having an NG (gastric) tube inserted. I had hoped to avoid the ER like the\nplague because they have been treating COVID patients. The young doctor (I could\nswear he was the doctor who broke the news of a malignancy to me when I dragged\nmyself to the ER last Easter Sunday), nurses and techs took good care of me and\nadministered all the tests (EKG, blood, vitals, urine etc.). To my great relief, based on the\nscans taken in the ER I do *not* have a blockage: there is some colitis and a potential\nintestinal infection (don't have the results on that yet). And some of my symptoms\nremain puzzling to me. I am seeing my PCP next Tuesday -- he's a compassionate guy\nwho gave me his personal cell phone number when he learned I had cancer, in case I\n                       554 / 1.901\nneed to contact him quickly. I hope we can puzzle through some of the symptoms\ntogether. Maybe I need to further rethink my diet (have been reading recipes for cancer\nsmoothies). Maybe I need a reset of some kind. Maybe my digestive system is not\nabsorbing certain nutrients well, or correctly Surely I was burnt out from not eating, so I\nfeel tired and find myself needing some extra sleep. So...much...uncertainty. Cancer\nsucks.\nTo my regret, because I am ultra-conscientious when it comes to work, I had to cancel\nTuesday night's grad seminar as I didn't think I'd be home in time to Zoom (I wasn't).\nWe've already figured out a plan for moving forward. Equally to my regret, I did arrive\nhome in time to watch the debate aka horror show aka assault aka Trump unhinged,\nwhile sipping soup and trying to relax (not the best plan). I.can't.even. Grotesque bully.\nShameless demon. Ominous boor. Asshole. I was still shaking the next morning.\nLast night my dear friend Maria spontaneously invited me to join her for a bite, so we\nheaded to one of our favorite spots, Barrel 21 (it's a distillery). We sat outside in their\npatio area on a chilly night, but we were kept toasty with big outdoor heaters, the kind\nthat make Paris caf\u00e9s so pleasurable in the winter. Our friend John joined us for a while.\nVarious immune system-compromising medical issues are keeping him holed up in a\nbarn on his property, while his wife and one son sleep in the main house and the other\nson quarantines at his grandmother's because he's daily exposed to other college\nstudents. How dramatically COVID affects the fabric of our social and familial relations. I\nate something very mild and enjoyed a delicious fruit-juice based, healthy 'mocktail,'\nprepared by B21's bartender extraordinaire, Josh. So very grateful to be back from the\nprecipice enjoying the evening with friends.\nThank you, Jackie, for your many kindnesses including cancelling your dentist's\nappointment so you could drive me home from the hospital! Thank you, Ben, Ethan and\nMom for your care and concern. Be well, everyone.",
    "comments": "Gosh, Willa, I'm so sorry that this hit, and that you were trying to navigate meetings with\ndeans, a seminar, and more while trying to get this addressed. It is great that you were\nable to enjoy an evening out last night after all that. The debate was just a horror. I\ncouldn't sleep afterwards, although on reflection I think Trump hurt himself some, and\nBiden did well in many ways (I shudder to think you were watching in a weak state, when\nI was white-knuckled and nervous and I wasn't just home from the hospital). I am\nthankful that you don't have another blockage and hope that you and the doctors can\nsort out exactly what it is, and I am hopeful that some rest and your good diet will\npromote healing.\n                       555 / 1.901\n  \u2014Nancy Locke, October 1, 2020  \nDear Willa, I'm so very sorry you've been put through this added hell recently (though\ngrateful at least it turned out you did NOT have an intestinal blockage!). This is as good a\ntime as any to tell you how much I admire your plugging away at your very demanding\njob, even while coping with this ghastly illness with all its anxiety, pain and\nunpredictability (\"awestruck\" is the most apt word!). Not an award you'd have chosen ,\nbut you certainly have my person of the year award for your perseverance and\ndedication. Also your ability to find pleasure and gratitude for the good things that still\ncome when they do - the kindnesses bestowed, the good news when it arrives and the\npleasures of living that remain. (Loved reading about your holiday on the Cape with all\nthe aesthetic treats you found. )\nCarpe Diem! A lesson in seizing what joys one can, not wasting any of our precious time\nwe're given - and at the same time, not dwelling on the pain and negativity that could for\nsome (moi?) completely color our time on this planet.\nThat includes your skillful, graceful writing in this unwonted but meaningful diary you're\nsharing. (You're certainly much inspiring me - among many others, I'm sure.).\nIt doesn't apply to all your readers, but I also find I'm learning quite a lot from you about\nlived Judaism - something I didn't have the opportunity to learn from experience due to\nmy family's estrangement from Judaism.\nDespite relying on the space bar, I'm continuing to feel frustration at my inability to\nparagraph in this format (I'm sure there's a way I'll discover with time), so I'll sign off for\nnow leaving only a last message on your FBk PM. A few suggestions of ways I've found to\nrelieve that hellish nocturnal cramping from which I too suffer. If at least one helps it\nwould gratify me - to remove a single one of the nails in your Calvary.  \n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, October 3, 2020  \nSo grateful to you for keeping your friends so closely posted on your journey\u2014I\u2019m sorry\nit\u2019s had so many twists and turns lately\u2014I am hugely impressed with all you are doing\neveryday\u2014I am grateful to keep connected to you during these incredibly unsettling\ntimes.

My digestion seems to have returned to semi-normal (or as normal as\nit ever gets for me), I'm eating sensibly, and I regained the few pounds I dropped\nprecipitously during the week I went on liquids. I had an appointment with my PCP this\npast week and he prescribed a daily dose of potassium (my level is within normal range\nbut on the lower side), a daily probiotic, and an another appointment with a nutritionist,\nthis one specializing in both cancer patients and digestive issues. I will follow up.\nMeanwhile, it was a busy week at school with some big projects starting to pile up.\nSeminar went quite well (always a pleasure to teach about the Dreyfus Affair, so\nrelevant...) and I led a faculty meeting and attended a host of other meetings etc. So\nvery grateful for my rewarding, secure job yet undoubtedly we're traversing a difficult\nperiod in academia, as in so many other fields: the job market for our graduate students\nseems bleak this year; our library has been hit with v. significant budget cuts targeting\nthe humanities in particular (this occasioned pushback in the form of a letter to the\nProvost from the humanities' department heads); Penn State IT abruptly laid off thirty\nemployees; some colleagues (and especially female ones) who are balancing work\nw/overseeing their kids' remote learning seemed totally maxed out; etc. We have a\nwonderful, empathic dean in Liberal Arts who is  trying to keep us all afloat and moving\nforward as best he can, but he's stressed too. We all are.\nGiven all this -- ie the strains and just plain weirdness of the moment, the dismaying\nnational backdrop etc. -- in addition to my health challenges, I try to be extra gentle with\nmyself to the extent possible. This morning I went to the farmers market with my friend\nHelen. I started to feel momentarily light-headed (a 'thing' that can happen to me\nsometimes when I'm dehydrated or have a slight stomach ached) but rebounded after\nsitting down for a while. Then treated myself to a manicure at a local day spa, followed\nby clothes shopping (bought one top) and then a mocha chip ice cream cone from\nMeyers Dairy. Yesterday, I enjoyed a lovely lunch outdoors at the Ale House with my\nfriend/former colleague Kathryn, then moved on to my hair stylist's (my hair continues to\ngrow out but is unruly because of the haphazard way it's come back in). Tomorrow,\nweather permitting, I'll walk a few loops at the Boalsburg Military Museum with a group\nof wonderful women (these monthly walks grew out of the ovarian cancer fundraiser I\norganized this past June). Then back to work and prepping for a week of meetings, with\nbig admin tasks to tackle.\nChemo this Wednesday, undoubtedly followed by up to a week of feeling like crap. As\nlong as I don't wind up in the ER again. \nCurrently have two women facing cancer (one at the beginning of her journey, one\ntowards the end) in my prayers.\n                       559 / 1.901\nIf all goes as planned, Ben and Sammi will come home for Thanksgiving. I miss them.\nMichael and I are trying to coordinate a joint family meal, as we did last year (pre-Covid),\nbut of course it's challenging as not everyone's been 'podding' together all along and\nthere's a certain amount of risk involved. So it's possible we might have to have two\ndinners on consecutive nights, one with each family unit. I'm also sorry I can't go to NY\nand celebrate with my mother and Arnold, Ethan and his family, but that too is risky right\nnow. Complicated times (sigh). Meanwhile, there's a new Borat movie to look forward to!\nLet's get our laughs when and where we can.",

    "entry": "Chemo went smoothly yesterday. Dr. Patel was not there as he's getting board\nrecertified this week, but the nurses took good care of me. My favorite nurse, Tracey,\n                       561 / 1.901\nadministered my treatment and I was further delighted to see that another very kind\nnurse (Brianne), who had come to my home several times as a visiting nurse, is now also\nworking in oncology. The chemo room was bustling but as soon as I was pumped full of\nBenadryl I started to doze, which was actually quite relaxing. A new chemo room will be\nopening in January. It will be sparkling new, with spiffy recliners, new equipment and -\nbest of all - windows (sorely lacking in the current configuration). At that point, I am not\nsure what my chemo status will be. I may be taking oral chemo exclusively. But it's nice\nto know of this improvement. Being in a windowless environment during chemo,\nespecially on a lovely fall day, is dispiriting.\nMy dear friend Helen drove me to chemo, and passed along a yummy brownie that one\nof her daughters had kindly thought to share with me. My equally dear neighbor Janis\npicked me up and we stopped at Meyer Dairy so I could get a mocha chip malted\nmilkshake. So comforting, such a cooling treat.\nToday I was slightly deflated to learn that my CA125 number had increased ever so\nslightly, from 17.5 to 17.7. Both Dr. Beavis' and Dr. Patel's nurses urged me NOT to\nworry about this, though, insisting it is considered stable and still very much within\nnormal range. And Dr. Beavis' nurse did put the NOT in capitals! But of course I was\nhoping for another drop - psychologically, it makes a difference. But I will try my hardest\nto take it off my 'worry list' for now.\nI feel ok today, slightly nauseous per usual. And I expect the very unpleasant symptoms\nto hit tomorrow. Had an important meeting w/our Graduate Dean, which went well, and I\nneed to run and get my white blood cell booster shot now, before dinner (later) and a\nZoom meeting for my condo association at 7 p.m.\nAnd all this on about 5 hours of sleep. Strangely, I awoke at 4 a.m. and was up for\nseveral hours, my mind overloaded with a minutia dump -- what should I put on my\ngrocery list for the young woman who shops for me every week? How can I best get\norganized for the meeting w/the Dean? But somehow broader horizons were opening and\nconstricting during this hour, as the French call it, \"between chien et loup\" (\"between\ndog and wolf;\" apparently, according to a former therapist, this is the hour when most\nsuicides occur, but I can assure everyone that this was *nowhere* near my mind early\nthis morning!).\nOpening horizons: a new couch I had been awaiting for several months finally arrived\nand looks lovely in my sun room. Texting a friend about this arrival, I mistakenly wrote\n\"son room\" (paging Dr. Freud, etc.), because my *son* and I have spent many hours in\nthe sun room over the last decade, watching t.v., talking, chilling. So I've been moving\nfurniture and photos around, opening up new physical (and mental?) spaces, trying to\nmake my home more like, in Ben's girlfriend Sammi's word, my 'oasis.'\n                       562 / 1.901\nAnd meeting (via Zoom) some new people who have led, and are leading, interesting\nlives -- another horizon opening. Fascinating, complex, textured journeys -- enough to\nkeep me up at 4 a.m. just contemplating them!\nConstricting horizons: sometimes I get griped by fear about my health. That fear was\nalso 'visited' upon me at 4 a.m. What's my horizon? 2 years? 5-8? 8-10? More? I read a\npost this morning from an admirable seeming woman who 'friended' me on Facebook in\nJune but whom I've never met -- she is also treated at KGOS (Kelly Gynecological\nOncology Service at Hopkins) and we 'met' at the time of the Service's big annual\nfundraiser (my #willapower turn). Her ovarian cancer has now spread into her lungs (I\nworry about this too but for now it's 'just' the exterior of my colon that's affected) but\nshe's warrior-ing on. So many brave women fighting this accursed disease. \nGrateful today for the gorgeous fall colors, kind texts and emails from family and friends,\ngrateful to have plenty during this awful time (number of Americans below poverty line\nhas increased by 8.000.000 since May -- what becomes of them, dear God?!). Life is\ngood today. And that's reason enough to be grateful. Off to my condo association\nmeeting to talk about fall leaf collection, landscaping and other blessed mundanities. \nBe well, everyone.",

    "entry": "Thank you to all who checked in on me and/or thought about me over the weekend. I'm\nalways slightly amazed that I can rebound given that two days after each of my current\nchemo treatments I feel like I'm succumbing to the worst flu imaginable plus an achy\nlower back and abdomen. Like clockwork, on chemo day + 2 my entire body, but\nespecially my head and neck area, begins to feel very tender and painful to the touch,\naccompanied by nausea. I simply feel *sore.* On chemo day + 3 I am completely\nuseless. Yesterday (when I reached the bottom of the abyss,) I slept until about 11 a.m.,\nthen had barely enough energy to drag myself to the couch, where I spent the rest of the\nday, dozing and later watching some t.v., pumped up with anti-nausea meds, Claritin to\ncounteract bone pain, and Ibuprofen. I felt sad and slightly depressed not being able to\nenjoy the gorgeous autumn day but knew I simply had to renounce any plans\nwhatsoever. Admittedly, my new couch is very comfy and I was cozily wrapped in a\nlovely pashima shawl (a gift from my friend Melissa - I owe you a thank you!), with a\nheating pad plopped on my stomach. My friend Helen was kind enough to bring 'Jewish\npenicillin' aka chicken soup, plus apple cider, Hagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream and some\ntasty feta/caramelized onion appetizer bites from Trader Joe's, out of which I concocted a\nsmall meal last night (although I hardly ate much at all during the day, perhaps one\nyogurt). Drifted in and out through the day, the sun washing over me, knowing that the\nonly way out of this painful morass was through. Might have benefited from some psalms\nor other 'inspirational' literature (encouraging fortune cookies?) but scarcely had the\nenergy to lift a book, iPad or even iPhone. Geez, I sure hope these super-strong drugs\nare at least melting away more cancer cells. And next round *may* be my last before a\nscan and then (?) oral chemo (parp inhibitors). I need to get the lowdown from Beavis\nand Patel.\nSlept deeply and at length again, my father appeared in my dream, which rarely if ever\nhappens - we were in disagreement about something. Miraculously, feel today like I'm\njust starting to round the bend, was able to sit at my desk and work for a while, while still\nfeeling worn out. Took a little drive (while I was absorbed with my pain, somehow late\nfall seems to have made an early-ish arrival). Hoping for more improvement tomorrow,\nas the work week begins. Much to do. The couch may be calling my name again this\n                       564 / 1.901\nevening.\nThank you, Jackie, for the mocha chip malted milkshake and good cheer, to Ben, Ethan\nand mom for frequent check-ins, to Michael for texting a photo of a huge \"Vote Him Out\"\nsign in our neighborhood (yes, that did lift my spirits!), to Mar and Jessi, Clare, Monique,\nVinni, Julie,  Mary, Melissa and a few other pals for checking in.  It really helps. Illness can\nbe so isolating. But I got my tribe!",

I'm happy to hear about their many kindnesses as well as the beauty coming\nyour way which you highlight perhaps as much to relieve us, your\nfans, as anything.\nAnother positive note I find in this attack, is that you are evidently able to detect a\npredictable pattern in your responses, days 1, 2, 3, etc. If this is how it was before, it\nseems reasonable to extrapolate that this course of treatment is zapping those nasty\ncells at least as well as last time.

It's been a busy week, and I've worked hard, so am treating myself to\nThai takeout tonight (mildly flavored dishes) and an evening curled up on the couch\nwatching t.v.  -- my reward for six hours straight of zoom meetings today. The meetings\nwere not uninteresting: first, an annual four-hour meeting with the other heads of Big\nTen foreign language departments to discuss our common concerns (many, given the\ncircumstances; COVID + the xenophobic policies of the current administration are having\ndire effects on academic institutions) and brainstorm solutions. Then a long department\nmeeting that I organized with a facilitator present to begin discussing a host of issues\nrelated to DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) as they affect our department. The meetings\nrequired much focus and mental and emotional energy>I'm beat!\nI am feeling alright. I get fatigued, but you probably wouldn't know it observing what I\nsometimes accomplish in a day or week, including teaching a three-hour seminar every\nTuesday night. And my digestive system still has a mind (or stomach) of its own. I am\nmeeting again with a nutritionist next week. I've woken up a few nights with leg cramps\nbut I've also enjoyed some delightful sleeps. Next chemo on Nov. 12th. After that round\nthere will certainly be a scan. I'm not sure what follows, perhaps some oral\nchemotherapy (parp inhibitors).\nThis morning, for some reason, I made the mistake of reverifying the prognoses for\novarian cancer, which I hadn't done in awhile. According the American Cancer Society,\nthe five-year survival rate is 50%. Full stop. I don't know how the effect of my already\nhaving had one recurrence inflects this statistic; I do remember Dr. Beavis telling me\nthat she felt my recurrence was a bit anomalous, perhaps related to the host of fistula-\nrelated problems I experienced earlier this year. She has also told me that part of my\ncancer (the 'sarcoma' part I suppose) is particularly aggressive. Conversely, statistics for\nHopkins patients, I was told (also by Dr. Beavis) may look somewhat better than the\naverages. I took this info into the shower with me and had a good cry, coupled with an\nanxiety attack. Then I put on a nice blouse, a cute hairband, and some make-up and\nwent about my meetings. Yet those numbers stick in my throat. On which side of the\n50% will I fall? I *do* know long-term survivors (but were their cancers as aggressive as\nmine?). Given my potentially shortened life expectancy, should I be going about my\nbusiness as usual? Or hitting my bucket list? Ok for me to have Thai take-out or should\nthe entirety of my nutrition be geared towards starving those cancer cells in any way I\ncan? I think I'm generally taking good care of myself, but can I do more? Trade-offs.\nUncertainty. Anxiety. Ugh. \"You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.\"\nI look forward to a relatively low-key week-end although I'll need to turn to work by\nSunday, if not before. I foresee some soup-making (butternut squash bisque and creamy\ntomato tortellini). Trying to puzzle through the challenge of how to see my friends safely\nnow that it's turning colder. Ugh.\n                       568 / 1.901\nAwaiting Tuesday with trepidation. Will vote on 'the day,'  braving a long line if\nnecessary. Fingers crossed, folks, that the end of our four-year national nightmare may\nbe in sight.\nToday this picture of my favorite mummy made me smile. This was the one 'homemade'\ncostume I ever ventured to make for Ben, and it was a success (although requiring yards\nand yards of gauze!). I always felt somewhat 'mom-shamed' by all the incredible\nhandmade costumes I saw kids sporting on Halloween but this one made me feel at least\nsomewhat vindicated! Ben was having so much fun trying to look 'spooky!'",

    "entry": "570 / 1.901\n                       571 / 1.901\nI couldn't receive my chemo this morning, as planned. My blood work revealed that my\nhemoglobin level is very low (7.6; normal for women is 12.0 to 15.3 grams per liter).\nApparently, my level has been trending downwards for the past several months.\nApparently too, this is a fairly common effect of chemo. Dr. Patel's concern was that if he\ntreated me, my hemoglobin level might drop so low that I'd need, in his words, \"a bag of\nblood.\" He ordered another lab test to determine whether my low hemoglobin level is\ndue to the chemo or, rather, to an iron deficiency (from diet, for example). If it's due to\nchemo, he can give me an infusion of iron through my port. If it's due to diet, I guess I\nneed to eat more iron rich foods or maybe take an iron supplement. He seemed to\nhesitate about whether we should go ahead with treatment today or wait a week\nbecause, as I pointed out, there's no guarantee that in a week's time my hemoglobin\nlevel will have risen if the trend has been downwards for several months. In the end,\nthough, he said: \"Let's play it safe.\" Part of me wanted to insist a bit about receiving\ntreatment today because waiting a week means that I'll barely be starting to rebound for\nThanksgiving, Ben and Sammi's long awaited visit, and a whole mess of holiday cooking\nI've been anticipating (with pleasure). Now I have to rethink my cooking schedule and I'll\nsurely need to enlist the kids' help. Oh well. Is it what it is. The best laid plans, yadda\nyadda...\nThe next problem was getting me on the schedule for next week. Everyone wants to\nhave her/his chemo finished before the holiday. I scheduled for next Thursday morning\n(the only available time), knowing that this means I'll have to miss a fairly important\nmeeting. Perhaps it can be Zoom-recorded for me. There was a moment when I started\nto feel overwhelmed -- between the difficulty scheduling the appointment to uncertainty\nabout whether I need to go back to the lab for another blood test to being unsure how I\nwould get home from Dr. Patel's office as my friend Helen had kindly driven me there to\nfeeling upset that I couldn't receive treatment today. I sunk down onto a bench in Dr.\nPatel's office and my eyes started stinging with tears, but I regained composure pretty\nquickly. I called my neighbor, Janis, and she was able to pick me up. We immediately\nlaunched into chat about how happy we were with the election results (she said her\npastor had delivered an ambiguous sermon about the results, as most of her fellow\nparishioners are Trumpiacs...).\nWell, now I may better understand why I felt so winded this past weekend on walks with\nmy friends Chris (Saturday) and Mary, Jackie and Clare (Sunday). And why I've generally\nbeen feeling very tired recently (I had chalked it up to work stress and the effects of\nhaving pushed through twelve weeks of the semester without a break). And perhaps why\nI was craving a hamburger this morning (I did, indeed, treat myself to a delicious, juicy\nhamburger with sweet potato fries for lunch!).\nIt remains frustrating and stressful for me to cope with things beyond my control, like\n                       572 / 1.901\ntoday's false start. As for my future treatment, that too remains unclear for the moment,\nalthough the likelihood is that I'll be put on maintenance therapy, ie oral chemo that will\nhopefully, I suppose, keep my cancer in check and has been shown to have success with\npatients like me who have both had a recurrence and do not have the BRCA mutation\n(remember that my cancer is the result of a random, non-inherited mutation, the [bad]\nluck of the genetic draw...). I asked Dr. Patel how long I would need that treatment and\nhe said he really couldn't tell me. It will depend on how I respond, to be assessed\nthrough periodic scans and bloodwork. So...much...uncertainty. The \"oh great\" news with\nthese parp inhibitors (the equivalent of my current treatment's causing heart damage in\na small number of patients) is that it can adversely affect bone marrow, also in a limit\nnumber of patients. \nI am, as always, so grateful for the well wishes, offers of food, cards and many other\nkindnesses that come my way before (and often during and after!) each treatment. They\nreally lift my spirits and help me warrior on. Yet I felt so wiped out when I got home\naround noon -- again perhaps the effect of the low red blood cell count + a very busy\nMonday-Wednesday at work + the anxiety around the blip this morning -- that I had to\nnap/rest a good part of the afternoon. Feeling a bit better now, still tired.\nAlso: my hair continues to morph as it grows in. I saw my stylist, Sarah, yesterday\n(below) and she did a good job. I'm also experimenting with scarves and turbans. And\nmakeup works wonders. I bought a lot of new clothes the other day. I try to convince\nmyself that if I look ok, I'm ok. Magical thinking, I know, but it works at least some of the\ntime.\n \np.s. **I do need to retain that Dr. Patel said I've done well with this treatment. At least as\nof last month, my CA125 number was in the normal range (I'll likely have this month's\nresults tomorrow). That is a good thing indeed.\nGod grant me the serenity\nto accept the things I cannot change;\ncourage to change the things I can;\nand wisdom to know the difference.\nLiving one day at a time;\nenjoying one moment at a time.\n                       573 / 1.901\nPhotos\n                       574 / 1.901\n                       575 / 1.901",

    "entry": "I've often found 'playing it safe' challenging, much like 'adulting' in general, sometimes.\nYet these strange COVID times, compounded by my immunocompromised state, demand\nit. So Dr. Patel decided we should 'play it safe' by delaying my chemo one week. Here's\nthe update since then: additional blood tests revealed *no* deficiencies in iron, folic acid\nand B12. So what's the deal with my severe anemia? Blame the chemo, Dr. Beavis wrote\nme. It kills both (bad) cancer cells and (good) red blood cells. Likely no amount of\noatmeal with raisins, salmon, dried and fresh pineapple, spinach and calves liver (all of\nwhich I've eaten or will eat within the next few days) will boost my red blood cell count\nsignificantly, although it can't hurt. Nor will an infusion of iron. So we have to hope that\nan extra week off from chemo will allow my body a bit more time to rebound. Crossing\nmy fingers that my treatment can proceed as (re)planned this coming Thursday.\nCA125 number is 18.2. Over the past three months, it's inched upwards from 17.2 to\n17.5 to 18.2, but is still well within the normal range of 0-35. Dr. Patel's nurse considers\n                       578 / 1.901\nit 'stable.' This is good news (my bad memory of my o.c. marker trending upwards before\nI was diagnosed with a recurrence is still very much with me, but I'm presuming this\nsmall an increase is still deemed negligible). Drs. Patel and Beavis conferred by phone\nthe other day and here's the plan: I'll have the final round of chemo, then a scan. Then\nI'll have a break (not sure how long) so that my body can recoup before being started on\na parp inhibitor, ie oral chemo for 'maintenance.' This relatively new (?) treatment has\nproven effective in patients (some? most?) who do *not* have the BRCA mutation but\nwho have had a recurrence (this is my case). I do not know how long I'll be on them nor\nwhat the potential side effects are. I am not yet at a point where I can process that\ninformation, especially if it contains worrisome elements (the potential for bone marrow\ndamage was already sufficiently anxiety-provoking, thank you very much). So I'll get\nmyself mentally prepared to discuss the next step with Dr. Patel (and perhaps also Dr.\nBeavis) this coming week. For now I'm focused on receiving my last round of chemo and\nturning the corner by Thanksgiving, after exhaustion sets in next weekend.\nAnd in \"Playing it Safe\" news, Part II: I'm very disappointed that Ben and Sammi will not,\nin the end, be coming home for Thanksgiving this year. All of us were starting to feel\nincreasingly alarmed by the rising COVID rates all over the country, and testing and\nquarantining are not foolproof guarantees against infection, especially taking into\naccount travel, contact with new germ pools etc. The thought running through my head\nrecently, which I had been getting ready to share with Michael: \"If anything happens to\nthe kids, I'll never forgive myself.\" So we're playing it safe. Of course, I love\nThanksgiving, revel in the cooking and sharing of my 'standards' (cranberry chutney,\nsweet potato casserole, jalapeno cornbread etc.), enjoy gathering with family. This year\nCOVID has conspired, though, to dislocate families and ramp up a sense of familial and\nsocial alienation. Many friends will likewise be separated from loved ones at the holidays\nthis year. So in 2020 we'll have a modern family meets COVID Thanksgiving with a twist:\nex-husband and I will split the cooking (Michael excels at cooking the turkey, so he's in\ncharge of the bird) but enjoy the feast in two different households; since I'll be physically\nalone, my mother (also alone), Ben and Sammi, and I (and anyone else who wants to\njoin) will (hopefully) gather virtually via Zoom. We'll make it work. It truly sucks, but\nCOVID oblige...\nI hope we'll figure out a way to get together over the December holidays. We'll see how\nthings are looking COVID-wise in the city and elsewhere and how I and everyone else\ninvolved are feeling. I'm missing the city so maybe I can contemplate a visit involving/an\nairbnb rental. So much of this is out of my control. We'll just roll with it.\nI was feeling so overloaded by all these blips that I got in my car and started driving,\nwhich is what I often do these days to settle myself. I headed out into the country on\nwinding roads, past farms, buggies, trees shedding their last autumn leaves, creeks,\nfarm stands -- and plenty of Trump signs, still defiant. I straightened the house, cleaned\nthe kitchen, and had a piece of jewelry repaired. Now it's time to pay bills (exciting,\n                       579 / 1.901\nhuh?) and see if I can find a good flick or Netflix offering this evening. Back to work\ntomorrow.\nStay safe, everyone.",

    "entry": "581 / 1.901\n                       582 / 1.901\nI completed my last round of IV chemo -- for now -- yesterday. Grand total: twelve rounds\nwith about a three+ month interval between them when I was (relatively briefly) in\nremission. I am not currently in remission but at least the Beast is at bay -- for now. And\noverall this second line of chemo has been effective: CA125 number is within normal\nrange, apparently there's been no further spread (which a CT scan on 12/9 will either\nconfirm or deny), my bloodwork looks ok overall (although I'm still low on potassium and\niron, despite eating calves' liver nearly every night last week, plus iron-rich oatmeal,\ndried fruits, spinach etc.). I have awful neuropathy in my toes -- can hardly feel them,\nand I don't expect that to dissipate. But, as my former father-in-law Seymour used to\nsay, mock-sighing heavily: \"I'm still vertical\" (actually, if chemo fatigue progresses as\nusual, I expect to be horizontal for nearly the entire weekend).\nUnlike last week, everything proceeded smoothly yesterday. My hemoglobin level had\nincreased from 7 to 8 (still low), so we proceeded with chemo. Tracey, my favorite nurse,\ntook good care of me. Pumped full of Benadryl, I took a snooze. The whole process takes\nabout five hours (including having bloodwork and then waiting for results). Dear friends\nHelen and Jackie transported me to and from, Jackie bearing the ceremonial 'chemo's\ndone' milkshake that I crave afterwards (mocha chip with malt, so soothing...).\nSince I know that I'm likely to crash tomorrow, I try to use the 1.5 days in between\nchemo and crash to power through my to-do list. Yesterday and today that entailed\nsome holiday cooking (I returned from chemo to cook up a veritable *vat* of cranberry\nchutney); putting out fires at work; other work-related emailing; scanning readings for\nmy grad students; picking up a prescription; throwing together a pot of chicken soup for\nboth myself when I'm couch potato-ing this weekend and a friend who will need some\ntoo; getting my follow-up shot; and enjoying a glorious *outdoor* lunch with my friend\nKathryn on this 60-degree November day. All this after a wretched sleep when my mind\nwas spinning, consumed with petty worries about the center of my cornbread being\nundercooked, the pile of dishes in my sink that needed to be washed and the dishwasher\nunloaded before my housecleaner arrived, the potential overhaul of one of our core\ngraduate courses -- and more. Hoping for a better sleep tonight.\nI treated myself to a pair of dangly Art Deco-looking earrings (via Etsy) for finishing\nchemo and I might also indulge in a pair of low black suede boots.\nRelieved to have a 'chemo break' for now, while my body recoups and strengthens for\nthe next stage. I'll see Dr. Patel on 12/17 to discuss the oral chemo that I'll take next. Dr.\nBeavis says that \"it's worth a try,\" ie we'll see how I do with it and whether I can handle\nthe side effects (I have chosen not to inform myself about them yet; I just need to\ndecompress and chill for a while before I get back on my chemo horse). The goal, as Dr.\nBeavis sees it, is to maintain as good a quality of life for me as possible. If it turns out I\n                       583 / 1.901\ncan't handle the effects -- well then, I think the plan might be to wait for the return of the\nBeast, whenever It chooses to attack me again. I need to regroup and find out more\nabout next steps but not...just...yet.\nWhen the drug company called me today to set up delivery of the likely medication\n(Zejula) -- I told them I didn't want it delivered until I had discussed the treatment plan\nw/Dr. Patel -- I initially nearly fainted of sticker shock -- something about an $1800\ncopay. However, I then learned that there is some sort of prescription card I'll receive\nthat will reduce the co-pay to... $0. And my insurance will cover the rest. What happens\nto the women who are uninsured??\nSad I won't be with family this year for Thanksgiving but at least there's Zoom. We had a\nlovely and delicious holiday last year at Michael and Sue's -- several of Ben's boyhood\nfriends dropped by for delicious pie that Ben had brought from Buttercream Bakery in DC\n-- and I look forward to being reunited with family next year. \nAm also looking forward to a Zoom ap\u00e9ro (likely herbal tea for me) on Sunday afternoon\nw/my bffs from graduate school -- Vinni, Shanny, Isabelle and Doris (in Paris) - aka \"les\nfilles.\" Laughs guaranteed.\nStay well and safe, everyone, and err on the side of caution for the holiday.",

    "entry": "Just a quick post to let everyone know I'm doing ok at the close of  my monthly weekend\nfrom hell. I was certain that Saturday I'd wake up with the worst flu-like symptoms\nimaginable, and as if on cue...: body aches; head, neck and back tenderness; nausea;\ndiarrhea; mild headache; loss of appetite; no energy etc. I went to bed Friday night by\nabout 11:00 and didn't get out of bed until Saturday at 4 p.m., and only then to ingest a\nbowl of oatmeal, and later some homemade chicken noodle soup. Dragged myself into\nbed again last night around 11 p.m. and got out of bed close to noon. I've spent the past\ntwo days in a twilight haze -- in the gloaming. It's all about pushing through. At some\npoint I was on the couch watching a Netflix documentary about a gospel choir, a heating\npad plopped on my stomach.\n                       586 / 1.901\nI feel marginally better today and know that I'll likely start to slowly rebound tomorrow. I\ndid manage a long Zoom call (unfortunately I was on speakerphone as my internet was\nacting out) with my grad school besties, with Doris joining us from Paris. So restorative,\nso comforting, so relaxing, so much fun to catch up with these dear friends of nearly\nforty years, whether we're comparing notes on our kids (we have five young men and a\nyoung woman among us), venting about work, or trading Thanksgiving plans. The\nprecise topics matter less than the powerful connection.\nI miss New York and my family this holiday week. The picture below was taken two years\nago in the city, after our Thanksgiving meal at an Italian (if I remember correctly)\nrestaurant on the UWS.  The restaurant bustled and we were all in good spirits, happy to\nbe together, and healthy. Who knew we'd be caught up in a maelstrom over the next\nyear or two?

    "entry": "588 / 1.901\n                       589 / 1.901\nThis year's 'Zoomgiving' was more pleasant than expected. Even though I was solo, I\nrallied for the holiday cooking (cranberry chutney, jalapeno corn bread, balsamic glazed\nbrussel sprouts, sweet potato casserole, apple crostata w/homemade whipped cream,\nwhile Michael was kind enough to bring over some delicious turkey, which I traded him\nfor sides). And it was warming to zoom with Ben and Sammi, Ethan and his family, Mom\nand Arnold (and Michael, briefly). Ben and Sammi cooked up a feast themselves\n(featuring lamb from a Park Slope butcher) and are starting their own traditions. L'dor\nvador. Physically, I was feeling ok -- I'm still quite tired from the cumulative effects of\nchemo/low hemoglobin. I may even have been feeling better a year ago on the holiday\nwhen we were at Michael and Sue's; I was undergoing chemo but had not yet had my\nsecond operation (fistula repair). But I'm alive, and for that I'm thankful. A friend who is a\n'wine person' brought over four bottles of wine for me to sample! Kind of him. I'm still\nworking my way through the white Bordeaux, which is delicious, and paired perfectly\nwith the turkey. Another friend brought over a French apple tart, made by her daughter.\nAnd I received lots of texts and emails from friends and family - thank you for them.\nTo my surprise, even after all the cooking, I didn't sleep well Thanksgiving night. My\nmind starts going down paths where I remember things from the past and begin really\ndigging into all the crevices. I've been leaning into memories quite heavily during this\nera of COVID and cancer, and sometimes they keep me up at night. A couple of wakeful\nhours, then, were spent mentally writing the story of a memorable Thanksgiving from my\npast, which Ben said he wanted me to tell him sometime. So Ben, this one's for you (and\nfor all of you who wish to read!).\nUne F\u00eate de Thanksgiving \u00e0 nulle autre pareille\nDear Ben,\nIn 1984 I was exactly the age you are now, twenty-five. Like you, I was in graduate\nschool at NYU, in the third year of my doctoral program in French Studies. Yet unlike you,\nI was living not in Brooklyn but in Paris, attending classes at French universities. Your\n\u2018aunties\u2019 Vinni and Shanny, and I, shared an apartment in the rue Vineuse, a pleasant\nstreet near the place du Trocad\u00e9ro in Passy, a very upper crust, fairly snobbish\nneighborhood in western Paris, to which many upwardly-mobile Parisians had flocked in\nthe nineteenth century. Unlike Park Slope where you live now, Passy was dead at night,\nbut during the day the long rue de Passy bustled with expensive commerce and elegant\ntea salons; we felt somehow \u2018fancy\u2019 living there. How did three American graduate\nstudents afford such tony digs, with heavy antique furnishings and a chandelier in our\nliving room (one day I came home to find the saucer-shaped ornaments decorating it\noverflowing with water, like a fountain; our upstairs neighbor had left her bathtub\nrunning, and compensated for the huge mess she had caused by offering us Opera\n                       590 / 1.901\ntickets)? Ronald Reagan was president and, although I instinctively distrusted him as a\nRepublican, he had done wonders for our economy: our dollar had hardly ever been\nstronger abroad. Vinni, Shanny and I kept our fridge stocked with champagne, bought\njewelry, clothes (and books) with abandon, and garnered a reputation, we three \nam\u00e9ricaines, for throwing fun, salon-like dinner parties.\nWhich is what we decided to do for Thanksgiving. We were missing the meals we\u2019d be\nhaving at home and wanted to impress our new French friends \u2013 smart, interesting and\nlively young men and women about our age whom we were meeting in our classes and\nelsewhere \u2013 with our culinary savoir-faire. We soon discovered, though, that fixing an\n\u2018American\u2019 Thanksgiving, at least in 1984 Paris, was easier said than done. First step:\nwhere to find a turkey? Turns out, no frozen Butterballs in the supermarket. So we\nheaded to a butcher shop in the rue de Passy, which in November had all sorts of freshly-\nkilled game (pheasants, partridges, rabbits etc.) hanging from its window. Might they\nalso have a turkey, we inquired? The butcher went into his freezer, and returned holding\na large turkey, still covered in its feathers, by its *neck.* Our mouths dropped, but\nrealizing we would have no other option, we consented to return the next day to\npurchase it. As we entered the butcher shop, we found the boucher singing off the\nturkey\u2019s feathers (the bird\u2019s neck, head and feet were nowhere in sight\u2026).\nNext problem: where, oh where, to find cranberry sauce? Not the kind of product we\ncould find in our local supermarch\u00e9 and it was well before the vogue of \u2018American\u2019 style\nrestaurants and grocery stores in Paris. As I recall, though, we were able to procure a\nfew cans of sauce at Fauchon, the tr\u00e8s chic specialty food store on the place de la\nMadeleine. Perhaps a parent sent us a few other provisions? I don\u2019t remember. Shanny\nmade a delicious apple pie from The Silver Palette Cookbook, although I also don\u2019t recall\nif that was the time she mistakenly added salt instead of sugar to the recipe, an epic fail.\nAnd photographs remind me that there was also homemade pumpkin pie, corn bread\nand, I think, my aunt\u2019s cranberry, Granny Smith apple, cashew and arugula salad with a\nlime vinaigrette made with extra virgin olive oil (we were in the early years of the EVOO\ncraze). I don\u2019t remember the actual cooking of the dinner but Vinni and Shanny look\nquite relaxed in our kitchen with our holiday turkey. As we took turns hosting dinner\nparties in New York during our first two years of graduate school, we were all, by this\ntime, budding cooks (like you!) who enjoyed getting creative in the kitchen.\nI have to imagine that our friends enjoyed our feast. The photos remind me that we had\nour ap\u00e9ro in the heavily-draped living room before moving into the dining room for\ndinner. Around the table we gathered Shanny\u2019s always smartly-dressed friends Joel and\nAnnick, a woman I don\u2019t recognize and Fran\u00e7ois, the then boyfriend (later to be husband,\nthen ex-husband) of our dear friend Doris. I don\u2019t remember if anyone else attended.\nI don\u2019t seem to have a picture of me at dinner. That\u2019s probably because, just like today, I\nwas the one documenting the event with my camera. So here\u2019s a picture of your mom at\n                       591 / 1.901\none of our other dinner parties, with a very nice guy named Didier, whom we met\nthrough other friends. Didier was just starting a successful career in the French\nadministration; I see now that he's the CEO of a major European energy company. I have\nno idea why there is a big bottle of Italian Strega on the table next to me; it\u2019s not\nsomething I usually drink. Perhaps I had bought it when visiting my father in Venice the\nmonth before? As you can see, Shanny, Vinni and I loved buying clothes and jewelry in\nParis (that strong US dollar!) and we seem to all have been accessorizing w/faux pearls\nand other types of bling for the occasion (I was wearing this low-waisted scarlet velvet\ndress that I adored). I wonder what Didier was saying that was making me laugh?\nIf this whets your appetite for more stories, another time I will tell you about our landlady\nin the rue Vineuse, foreign-born Madame Rose (who constantly got her French pronouns\nmixed up and who, after many months, revealed to me that she was Jewish; fearing anti-\nSemitism [?], she always told us cryptically and in hushed tones, when planning a trip to\nIsrael, that \u201cje vais \u00e0 la campagne\u201d). Or I\u2019ll tell you the one about my upstairs neighbor in\nMme Rose\u2019s building. Of all the buildings in Paris, how did the son of my mother\u2019s best\nfriend, Jon Harber, whom I had babysat when he was little, wind up in mine during his\nstudy abroad semester and turn out to be quite the partyer?\n \n \nPhotos\n                       592 / 1.901\n                       593 / 1.901\n                       594 / 1.901\n                       595 / 1.901",

I am grateful for this reprieve. But now of course I'm gearing\nup for my CT scan this coming Wednesday, which always makes me awfully anxious\n(what have those sneaky cancer cells been up to? Lying dormant? Multiplying? Hanging\nout?). The following week, I'll see Dr. Patel and likely start on Zejula, a 'parp inhibitor'\nthat I'll take daily for maintenance. Worst possible Scary Side Effects include certain\ntypes of cancers, compromised bone marrow due to lowered white blood cell count etc.\nSo I'll be monitored closely for the first month or so, with weekly (I think) bloodwork and\ndaily heart rate and blood pressure checks (I'll need to get a cuff to assess my b.p.). I\nhope I can handle the drug. Dr. Beavis said it was \"worth a try.\" I still need to get clearer\nabout what she meant exactly, but I believe she meant that if it doesn't work out (ie if I\ncan't handle the side effects), we will simply stop the treatment. In that case, I suppose, I\nhang out until I have another recurrence,  setting in motion 'third line chemo.' I am\nheartened to see that a fellow Hopkins patient I have come to know via Facebook,\nrecently given a discouraging prognosis, has had a very good result with Zejula, and her\nCA 125 number has gone down.  This gives me hope.\nMeanwhile, we're gearing up for the last week of the semester and then exam week. As\nmy graduate seminar was small, my workload will be manageable, but I have a small\nslew of other tasks to complete before we break for roughly a month around Dec. 18th.\nSometimes I honestly can't believe I accomplished all I did this semester in terms of\nteaching and administering -- sadly, not in terms of research but I have high hopes for\nwinter break, as finishing up an article that just needs a bit more work before I can send\nit off. Ben will come home for a week in early January! As for me, I'll likely stay put,\nwaiting out the COVID storm. But sorely tempted by that loft apartment on W. 15th\nstreet that cousin is offering to lend me while she and her husband are holed up at their\ncountry home in Hudson.\n*****\nBut let's turn to something more pleasant, shall we? Having read my account of our Paris\nThanksgiving in 1984, Vinni jogged my memory in an important way, reminding me that\nwe hosted not one but *two* Thanksgiving dinners that year (this was corroborated by\nher [future] husband, Steve, who was also studying abroad in Paris in 1984-1985);\npresumably we could not fit the entire membership of our growing coterie around our\ntable and our French friends were clamoring for a taste of an 'authentic' American\nholiday. Since Vinni and I brought our memories into focus via text a few days ago, I\nhave unearthed another crucial piece of evidence in my 'private archives' (one of my\nmost prized possessions): an a\u00e9rogramme to my mother and brother describing the\n                       601 / 1.901\nevent itself! Here's what I wrote on 1 December 1984:\nDear Mom & E,\nIt was so nice to talk to you on Thanksgiving. I hope you had a nice holiday - tell me\nabout it. As I told you, our (2) Thanksgiving dinners were a great success. I guess turkeys\nare pretty exotic here - the butcher had to de-plume them, cut off head, limbs, clean\nthem - in front of us - he seemed to enjoy that! We stuffed them (chestnut and olive\nstuffing), made mashed sweets (I invented a recipe), corn bread, green beans in\nbechamel sauce, cranberry salad, gravy + pumpkin pie + apple pie. Cranberries +\npumpkin could only be found at Fauchon, the fanciest specialty store. Thursday night, we\ninvited Doris and her boyfriend Fran\u00e7ois, 2 friends of Shanny's (Jo\u00ebl + Annick), a friend of\nVinni's. Friday night William and his brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me + 2 friends from school, Sam +\nSteve -- that was a lot of fun but a big job. I really sympathize with you, Mom - I don't\nknow how you made all those dinners for so many people!\nA photo(on the back of which I've written \"Thanksgiving 84 - (Very) rarely am I\nsurrounded by so many men,\" reveals our dinner guests that second evening. Left to\nright: Sam Thorsen, a friend of ours from the Institute of French Studies at NYU, yours\ntruly, Steve Bold, another friend from NYU French Department; two French brothers\nwhom we had met through our friend Isabelle (I think). Shanny had a thing for J\u00e9r\u00f4me\n(Brother 1), an ultra-smart young intello now a media studies prof at Tel-Aviv University.\nI had had a thing for (and with, in New York) William (Brother 2), an equally brilliant and\narticulate young attorney, now a prominent human rights lawyer, but in Paris we were\njust buddies. Vinni and Steve wound up marrying (as did Doris and Fran\u00e7ois), but the\nsparks (unless I missed something?) were not yet flying in 1984. Sam was a dear soul\nand a bit of a lost soul, struggling with his coming out at a time when many gay men still\nremained closeted. He had a lovely Georgia drawl (he hailed from Savannah) and was\ndroll and a great companion and confidant. One night around midnight I heard pebbles\nhitting my bedroom window; Sam was in the street below (our genteel\nPassy quartier was deserted at night), stumbling and calling up: Willlaaaa! Willlaaa!\n(think Stanley Kowalski bellowing: \"Stellaaa! Stelllaa!).  He came upstairs and sort of\ncrumpled in my living room, smelling of sweat and alcohol and cigarettes. I think I just\nheld him, or I like to think I did.  We lost him to AIDS in 1991.\nI'm wearing a fabulous deep navy velvet jacket with ornate beading that I had found in\none of my grandmother's closets in her brownstone on E. 94th street. I loved to\nrummage through her dozens of hatboxes, jewelry cases and fifth floor closets to find\nhidden treasures (once I found a $20 bill crumpled up in the toe of an old pair of ice\nskates), such as this very 1940s looking jacket (boxy padded shoulders), which I liked to\nwear low-cut, loosely pinned up and tightly belted. I think I look pretty happy here,\ntottering between a gamine and a slightly hot mess, surrounded by the guys. I still have\nthe jacket but the purple net lining is all torn and the beading is coming undone. May be\n                       602 / 1.901\ntime to have it repaired.\n\"These fragments I have shored against my ruins.\"\nPhotos\n                       603 / 1.901\n                       604 / 1.901\n                       605 / 1.901",

    "entry": "Everything went as smoothly as possible with my CT scan this morning (routine scan\nfollowing three rounds of IV chemo), although it's certainly not fun. I had to wake up at\nthe ungodly hour of 7 a.m. (I know, I know), which might have been tolerable had I not\nbeen so very tired from hosting a zoom speaker event the night before in my graduate\nseminar on the Dreyfus Affair. I was so beat afterwards that I barely had the energy to\nprop myself up on my couch, eat a bowl of tomato tortellini soup, and watch reruns of\n\"Beat Bobby Flay.\"\n(One of) the worst part(s) of the entire scan experience (there are several) is the\ninterdiction against food and drink for four hours beforehand. This might not be an issue\nif I didn't wake up every morning feeling so thoroughly dehydrated. In any event, per\nusual, I had to drink two large bottles of contrast liquid on arrival. The revolting taste of\nthe barium (resembling greasy melted chalk) initially made me gag, then I willed myself\ninto pretending that it was a fine Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape or equivalent, going so far as to\nsoftly intone to myself \"Mmmm....\" after each rotten swig.  The rotgut swilling took about\ntwo hours while the scan itself went fairly quickly. I know most of the technicians by now\nand they're quite nice. The unpleasant aspect of the scan itself is receiving an additional\ncontrast dye via IV, which nearly instantly fills my mouth with a nauseating warm\nsalty/metallic taste. I threw up twice at Hopkins when being pumped with this stuff so\n                       607 / 1.901\nnow I always ask to hold onto a container of which I can avail myself if I feel the urge.\nAnd that was my morning. \nI popped into Wegman's to pick up a few items after I left the medical center, then\ntreated myself to a large cappuccino at the Pump Station Caf\u00e9. When I returned home I\nlay down for an hour or so as I felt wiped out.\nI managed to make a dent in my backlog of emails in the afternoon  while pinging and\nponging back and forth on the phone between the pharma company that will be\ndelivering my new oral chemo med (Zejula) and the company supplying me with a card\nto reduce my copay. During about three of these calls I was (still) told that my copay per\nmonth would be $1800 -- which produces the effect of being stunned with a cattle prod\nor laser each time I hear it. My patience was really wearing thin as I was tired. By the\nend of the day, though, word had arrived that my copay, thanks to this miracle card, will\nindeed be $0 (thank goodness for small miracles). Good news. Less good news: I must be\nhome from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. to sign for my medicine whenever it's delivered. I can\nhandle that. Question mark: Will I be able to tolerate this new medication? Will it wreak\nhavoc on my body? Bigger question mark: what will my scan show? Maybe I'll find out\ntomorrow. Or maybe not until I see Dr. Patel next Thursday. Or maybe sooner, via the\nradiologists at either Geisinger or Hopkins. So....much...uncertainty.\nI dreamt last night that I was in a crowded public place, indoors (perhaps a wedding that\nI had been invited to or that I was at least viewing, although I wasn't dressed formally).\nYet it appeared that everyone there (not just the wedding guests but crowds of people\nwalking in or near the indoor venue) had tacitly decided, collectively, to no longer wear\nmasks. I was alarmed by this, not really panicked but surprised and worried.  COVID-era\ndreams... And then this morning I was swigging my greasy melted chalk (I hear 2020 was\na notable vintage) when I realized that this entailed my taking off my mask, indoors, for\nthe duration of the swigging -- and that made me a bit nervous. And then this morning,\ntoo, I read a long NYTimes article about how hospitals, especially outside urban areas\n(Altoona, PA, was mentioned), are full to maximum capacity with COVID patients. MUST\nNOT GET SICK!",
    "comments": "What a day!! I'll bet that brew you had to swig would kill any nearby germs -- and your\n                       608 / 1.901\ntime on the phone was also well worth the bother.

He spent about 45 minutes with me and I\nwas grateful for his time.\nThe results of my scan seem not much changed from the last time (September), which is\ncertainly not bad news. No new masses, nothing pertinent in my lymph nodes to report,\nno new findings of significance. There is a 1.1 cm 'structure' in my right pelvis that was\nalso noted in September that is at present 'indeterminate.' It might be nothing or it\nmight be something. The doctors will keep an eye on it. A PET scan may have showed\nmore but Dr. Patel explained to me these have to be 'rationed' as after a certain point\nthe insurance company won't cover them :(. So the CT scan was the fallback this time\naround. He says he spends hours on end w/the insurance companies trying to advocate\nfor his patients, often to no avail... Healthcare coverage in America - don't get me\nstarted...\nI need to have a routine port flush the final week in December.\nAnd next week I'm to start on Zejula (my plan is to start next Friday after an important\nprofessional presentation that I need to be in good shape for; Dr. P. said this was fine\nand I have the medication on hand). We went over some of the (numerous) potential\nside effects. The one that he is anticipating concerns my blood counts; they are likely to\ndrop (both hemoglobin and white blood count). Dr. P's office will be testing my blood\noften (once weekly for the first month, then once monthly) and I'll need to monitor my\nblood pressure and heart rate at home (I'll purchase a wristband that can measure both).\nIn anticipation of some of these side effects, I'll be starting off on 200 rather than 300\nmgs daily. As he can be rather brusque sometimes, Dr. Patel seemed a bit impatient with\nall my questions. While I explained that they stem in part from anxiety, he encouraged\nme to not get bent out of shape over things I cannot control (generally sound advice),\nreasoning that we'll deal with my particular symptoms and reactions (should I have any)\nonce I start on the medications. He even conjectured -- somewhat jokingly? -- that the\nreason I may be fatigued is because I have so many questions (and hence worries)\nswirling through my brain. Lest you think he is too abrupt, let me underscore that in the\nend I have come to appreciate his 'no nonsense' approach and practicality as well as his\nskills as an oncologist. I've definitely grown to trust him in the year and a half or so since\nI've been his patient.\nSo here's the bottom line, per Dr. Patel's 'straight talk express:' a)given how very ill I was\n                       610 / 1.901\nlast April, and the seriousness of my cancer, I'm currently doing as well as can be\nexpected. And that's a blessing; b)the parp inhibitor has the potential to buy me some\ntime.

Do things you enjoy.\" \"I am enjoying it, that's\nwhy I don't want it to end!\" Sounds good to me.\nAbout to light candle #2.

It seems evident to me that I repressed the final point:\n1)By many measures, I'm doing better than I was in April-May of last year, when I was\nfirst diagnosed and had the mother of all debulking surgeries.\n2)Zejula (and other parp inhibitors) have been shown to work better in women with the\nBRCA mutation, which I do not have. However, a number of studies have shown (and Dr.\nBeavis even sent me an article on this from a medical journal) that parp inhibitors can\nalso prolong life in patients without the BRCA mutation, which is my case, who have\nadvanced recurrent ovarian cancer (my case too). Hence her assessment that Zejula is\n\"worth a try.\" I'm game.\n3)Dr. Patel cannot at this point endorse my receiving the anti-COVID vaccine. As yet\nthere are no FDA nor other guidelines for the (safe) administration of this vaccine to\ncancer patients, no hard knowledge, as far as I understand it, about potential side\neffects, potentially risky drug interactions etc. So instead of being closer to the front of\nthe line I appear to be, at this moment, at the back of the line, perhaps not even in line.\nWhat a disappointment, and yet another example of how COVID has been extra-\nchallenging for those of us with cancer, for myriad reasons [insert long list here]. But\nthere's nothing I can do about it except receive the vaccine against my oncologist's\nadvice, and I don't think I'm willing to take that risk. And hopefully guidance from 'the\nauthorities' will be forthcoming before too long. I'm sure the small army of us cancer\npatients/survivors will demand it!",
    "comments": "It's OK that you are not at the top of the list to receive the anti-Covid vaccine. In this\ncase, I think, caution is the wise choice. Soon enough there will be information on\nwhether it is beneficial for cancer patients.\nI, too, was advised against getting the vaccine, by my cardiologist, since I already have\nhad the illness. So I have to hope that whatever antibodies I gained will last a while.\nStay on the road to recovery! No new bad news is good news.

    "entry": "615 / 1.901\n                       616 / 1.901\nJust a short note to ask everyone to direct some healing energy my way as I start on my\nnew chemo regimen tomorrow morning. I'll take 300 mg of Zejula daily, in the form of\ntwo pills. I spoke at some length with the Geisinger pharmacist (or perhaps she was a\nnurse?) who will be working with Dr. Patel to oversee my 'day to day' during this\nregimen. For example, she will likely review (weekly, then monthly) results of blood work\nwith me, make sure my blood pressure is not out of bounds, and check in on me\nregularly. Since I am most nervous about the potential side effects, she confirmed that\nthe likeliest of these will be fatigue; high blood pressure (which might manifest itself as\ndizziness, nausea); and lowering of white and red blood cell counts. I bought a cuff with\nwhich to measure my blood pressure and heart rate and hope it will work well (and that I\nwill work it well). I have nausea meds. My local pals are on call. And fortunately I've just\nabout finished my grading (awaiting one straggler...) and have a few weeks off before\nspring semester starts on Jan. 19th. So I can sleep in, eat well (I see soup making in my\nfuture), take walks (although I'm really cold-averse!) and replenish. Above all, I'll keep in\nmind that each pill is potentially prolonging my life. That will provide motivation, but if\nthe side effects impact my quality of life too negatively, I will need to rethink.\nIn grad school, I had a professor named Jindrich Zezula and I can't help thinking of him\neach time I reach for the Zejula!\nA highlight of the weekend was a somewhat impromptu Rezoomion with about eighteen\nformer housemates from Currier House, the Harvard residence where I lived, loved,\ncried, partied, studied, danced, made friends, and learned lots of valuable life lessons\nover forty years ago. The impetus for the reunion was a photo I posted on Facebook of\nmy Currier-mate David Gifford and me reconnecting in Paris several years ago at a fairly\nswanky caf\u00e9/bistrot across from the Parc Monceau (David was served the most gigantic\nmille-feuilles known to man; restaurant patrons were staring at it, agape; David, who had\njust arrived from Japan, downed most of it after the two of us had indulged in an equally\ndecadent, buttery slab of pat\u00e9 de foie gras with some delicious large crystals of salt\nsprinkled on it). A few comments on this photo led David, my friend Chris Ahmadjian and\nI to put together the reunion, which was a lot of fun! It was a two-hour nostalgia trip,\nwhich jogged my memory about certain forgotten details: that *tree* in the middle of the\nCurrier House dining room (apparently no longer there); the grill where we bought cheap\nand greasy late-night snacks to fortify our studying; that resident pre-med tutor who was\nalso a skilled musician; and oh yes, x really was dating y. Those were good (although\nangst-ridden) days and I'm grateful to still have some of my Currier friends along for the\nride.\nWas also happy to zoom with my mother and then my aunt, who both celebrated\nbirthdays this week (my mother's 84th and her sister Marlene's 87th! - the Medjuck\nwomen are schooling their kids and grandkids in graceful longevity). And to zoom with\n                       617 / 1.901\nBen of course - he'll be here for a week in early January and I'm sure lots of cooking will\ntake place.\nI was also a discussant Friday afternoon during a conversation with an author about her\nnew book (concerning women collectors of Japanese art in the late 19th c.). This zoom\nevent was organized by a professional society I belong to (Nineteenth-Century French\nStudies) and attracted about 100 people. I had not 'presented' in this type of setting\nsince my diagnosis and was glad to realize that I hadn't lost my mojo. It was a lot of fun,\nthe kind of professional activity I revel in, although truth be told I was very tired\nafterwards.\nBlessings for the solstice, when new light emerges from the dark. Such a wonderful,\nmysterious time.",

My energy level has been fine; after a full\nday yesterday I whipped up three cranberry orange nut breads. So far my bp and pulse\nare normal; Zejula can notoriously trigger high blood pressure. As for my blood counts\n(Zejula can also notoriously make red and white blood cell counts plummet, in rare cases\ncausing blood cancers), I'll know more when I have my blood tested on Monday and then\nonce a week thereafter for the first month. It is possible that the side effects of Zejula\ndon't manifest until one has been taking it for awhile (I don't know that for a fact, I'm just\nimagining). Yet Dr. Beavis told me that she currently has a patient who has experienced\nno side effects from Zejula, except for mild fatigue in the beginning - this is encouraging.\nFor now, I pray that I will continue to feel generally well. Sure beats IV chemo so far.\nI may have mentioned that I likely can't get vaccinated against COVID yet. Both my\noncologists tell me that there is not enough data to know how it might affect cancer\npatients currently in treatment. I hope that soon more will be known but for now I have\nto remain very patient -- and very careful, especially if my white blood cells are\nsuppressed.\nI turned my grades in on Monday and put the semester to rest. Ecstatic to have a bunch\nof days of completely unstructured time. I've been writing holiday cards, a relaxing\nyearly ritual. Tomorrow I'll probably write them while listening to to traditional Christmas\nhymns, which I love even though I don't observe Christmas. I like the 19th century ones\nlike \"O Come, O Come Emmanuel,\" sung by a splendid choir like that of King's College,\nCambridge, or medieval or Renaissance hymns and carols. Such meditative, soulful,\ntrancelike music and words. Also enjoyed a long phone call and a Zoom chat with two\ndifferent friends (plus a long Zoom with my aunt), and watched cooking shows on t.v.\nSpeaking of which, I think my next read will be David Chang's new memoir, _Eat a\nPeach._\nAlso went to my hair stylist's, where Joe (the owner) worked wonders. He's been\ncompassionate and discreet all along, crafting a short bob for me when my hair was\nstarting to fall out last year. It's taken a good year, but now my hair is back in earnest!\nIt's still short but feels healthy and I have some curls in the back for the first time in my\nlife (it grew in that way). There's enough length now that Joe was actually able to style it,\nfreeing me from the bizarre-looking mop of hair I've been sporting (and disguising with\ncute headbands, scarves, clips etc.) as my hair inched (or rather centimetered) its way\nback.\nI was so happy with the effect of this cut hat I posted my pic on a Facebook page I joined\ncalled Sisterhood of Ovarian Cancer Survivors. Because the comments on this page\nalways scream solidarity, I received many affirmations from this army of 'sisters.' The\n                       623 / 1.901\none I like best: \"Beautiful lady!

    "entry": "\"Quand le ciel bas et lourd p\u00e8se comme un couvercle\"\nSome days I feel like I am thriving, others striving, others yet merely surviving. Today\nbegan with 'surviving,' but improved as the day went on. Zejula, as predicted, is messing\nwith my blood pressure. The diastolic bp number has been inching upwards all week, to\nthe point where this morning it seemed alarming to me based on the range I had been\ntold was normal (it turns out that that range has recently been expanded, unbeknownst\nto me, one of the many confusions of my day). Should I go to the ER (a place, by the\nway, which I wish to avoid like the plague)? Am I adjusting the bp cuff correctly? Should I\ntake my bp again (I did this three times in succession, yielding very different results each\ntime, which only made me more anxious)? I lay down on my bed for a while, curled into a\nfetal position, then texted my brother who, as he habitually does, provided some\nsensible input and helped calm me down (thank you, Ethan). I then decided the optimal\npath would be to call the pharmacist to whom Dr. Patel is handing off this part of my\ncare (anything to do w/my Zejula regimen); she works with him and specializes in oral\nchemo drugs. But she is frustratingly hard to reach: each time I call I need to go through\na long phone tree, only to be put on hold and leave a voice mail each time. I can also\ncontact her through Dr. Patel's nurse's mailbox in the Geisinger portal, but not directly\nthrough the portal. Complicated! I also decided to see if one of Dr. Patel's nurses would\ncheck my blood pressure when I had my bloodwork done at Scenery Park; that was\nquickly agreed to. In the meantime, I did receive emails from the pharmacist basically\ntelling me not to worry, that the bp was still normal (whereas she had told me to go to\nthe ER if my diastolic bp number was over 100, now she was telling me that both\nnumbers, upper and lower, needed to be in abnormal range for there to be cause for\nconcern).\n \nWhen I went to get my blood taken, the technician had no idea how much blood to draw\nand for which tests; there were no notes about that in my chart. Oh. This problem took a\nlittle while to get sorted out. Then I went downstairs to Dr. Patel's office, where Regina,\none of the nurses, checked my blood pressure, which she found to be normal, but when\nwe tried twice more with my cuff we again got very different results, one of which\nseemed very high. Dr. Patel was not in the office and Kayla (the nurse who assists him\nand sort of oversees all the other nurses) was tied up. So I had no one to voice my\nfrustration to except Regina, telling her that I felt I wasn't being well cared for at the\nmoment and worrying out loud if I was going to have a heart attack. I had all sorts of\n                       626 / 1.901\nquestions about my bp that she couldn't answer. Normally I probably would have burst\ninto tears at that point but as I'm on Lexapro so my affect is pretty flat much of the time.\nProbably for the best.\nI was sort of turned around when I got home (c. 2:30) -- I had had great plans to dive\nback into my research today -- so I just lay on my bed for a while and read. Anna (the\npharmacist) called me and imparted some welcome news: my bloodwork looks good!\nThe Zejula has laid off my red and white blood cells and platelets for now. She also\nreiterated that I shouldn't worry about my bp (which of course stress can cause to\nelevate) and that they'd be concerned about consistently high numbers (ie over a three-\nday period) - that was news to me, but ok, good. She also said that her protocol was to\ncall me once a week to go over everything, leaving me a bit concerned about who I\nshould contact if I felt anxious or if something acute transpired. I don't think she gave me\na direct answer but she did make clear (albeit nicely, even overly nicely) that it shouldn't\nbe her.\nA message from a friend in France arrived au bon moment and motivated me to look at a\nproject that we might collaborate on, so I reread most of the manuscript (140 pages), my\ntranscription of a fascinating unpublished diary from 1878 set mainly against the\nbackdrop of the Opera and the Opera ballet as well as the Paris World's Fair of that year.\nWhile rereading was fairly 'low hanging fruit,' it did get me reconnected to my work and I\nlook forward to continuing tomorrow. And it kind of got my off-kilter day back on track.\nThe crappy day further redeemed itself when an unexpected bouquet of bright yellow\nflowers in a vase was delivered -- sent by someone at Penn State who is thoughtful, kind\nand humane. It was *exactly* what I needed and brightened my day considerably. I felt\nthe anxiety I had been holding all day start to dissipate.\nOn another note, I am still writing holiday cards! If you haven't received one from me yet\n(especially if you were kind enough to send me one), I am still working on them. They'll\nbe more like New Year's cards this year. \nHope I'll be back to thriving soon. I'd even be ok w/striving.\n \n \n \n \n  \n                       627 / 1.901",

    "entry": "....and did I mention a roller coaster?\nDr. Beavis (my wonderful gyn-onc from Hopkins) just called w/the Hopkins' radiologists\nreading of my recent CT scan. From a cancer perspective, things look overall good.\nThere's some 'nodularity' in my pelvis that they are watching. But the radiologists also\nsaw what they believe to be two tiny blood clots, one in my lung, one in my leg. The\nGeisinger radiologists here in State College had not picked that up. That was of course\nconcerning because of the danger of an embolism. So I have to (re)start Lovanox (blood\n                       630 / 1.901\nthinner), twice a day, by injection (ie I inject myself - not fun, but I know how to do it).\nThis should take care of the problem, and the clot will be absorbed back into my\nbloodstream. The radiologists recommended that I have another CT scan now to see\nwhether the clots have changed in size etc. but Dr. Beavis felt we should proceed\nstraight to treatment. The clots' formation is cancer-related. \nIn other news, I'll take the Zejula as long as my CA125 number is stable. If it starts to rise\nthat could indicate a recurrence. Dr. Beavis reminded me that if a second recurrence is\nto occur, it usually does so after the same interval as the first recurrence. In my case this\nwas barely six months. However, she reminded me that all the problems related to the\nfistula could well have been an aggravating factor. So we'll see. We agreed that we will\ncross that bridge when/if we come to it. In the meantime, the plan is to enjoy every day.\nIn better news, she now thinks that I should be able to receive the COVID vaccine when it\nbecomes available to me. The oncology community is hoping that there will be CDC\nguidelines regarding the vaccine and cancer patients, but it is not available yet.\nVoil\u00e0. Never a dull moment.",

    "entry": "Last year on this date I enjoyed a coffee outside with my friend Jeff at Caf\u00e9 La Colombe\nin Blagden Alley (D.C.) on a sunny day, then snagged Ethiopian takeout from a great\nplace near Ben's former apartment before hunkering down at his place for a peaceful\nevening watching t.v. and chilling while he and Sammi were in New York. The next day I\ntook a commuter train to Baltimore in the hopes of having a fistula between my\nabdomen and intestine 'plugged' at Hopkins, thereby eliminating the need for a second\nopen surgery. When I awoke from that procedure (I was under light anesthesia), Dr.\nHolley (an interventional radiologist) said to me: \"It didn't work. I'm sorry. There's\nsomething else going on. There's nothing more I can do for you.\"\nThe failure of this procedure next led to my having a second major open surgery in\nMarch, to repair the fistula (and snip out other pieces of my intestine and colon in the\nprocess). That operation, which lasted about nine hours I believe, went well. A few days\ninto my recovery, the news channels started to be blanketed by coverage of COVID and\nthe slew of emergency measures being put in place in NY and elsewhere. It was\nalarming. The next day, out a window near my room in the hospital, Ben and I began\nseeing Hopkins employees in full Hazmat suits stopping each vehicle arriving at the\nhospital, for questioning. The day after that, the hospital barred all visitors , so my\nmother and Ben could no longer spend time with me. And the day after that, the surgeon\nwho had performed my operation, Dr. Sandy Fang, came into my room and said: \"You\nseem to be doing pretty well and it turns out we're going to need the beds.\" I was\ndischarged the next day.\nAs some point not long after that, my cancer recurred, which is to be expected with\novarian cancer. I had been NED (no evidence of disease) for barely six months, which is\nsort of the tipping point between what is considered a quick recurrence and a 'not quick'\none (there are technical terms for this but I can't recall them right now); the time lapse\nbefore a first recurrence can be a predictor for the timing or 'rhythm' of subsequent\nrecurrences.\n                       632 / 1.901\nAnd that was only the first few months of the year..\nI won't dwell on how the COVID-cancer double whammy made for a second 'annus\nhorribilis' in a row for me and I won't enumerate the many many things - activities,\nplaces, travels, people, sensations, routines -- I miss, just like everyone else.\nInstead, I choose to focus on the bright spots. There were indeed a few:\n*March-August: The day I was discharged from the hospital in March, Ben drove me back\nto State College -- and didn't leave for five months. A while after that, Sammi came to\njoin him/us. Both of them teleworked from here, using both my home and Michael and\nSue's as office and living space. Thankfully, we had plenty of room to accommodate\nthem. My memories from that time are of trying out lots of new recipes for our convivial\nmeals (and not having to clear or wash the dishes!), working on jigsaw puzzles, sprucing\nup my house thanks to both Ben and Sammi's input re new furniture (and their skill in\nassembling some pieces), long talks about everything, including the unprecedented time\nwe were living through, and just a deep sense of comfort from being together. Grateful\nfor this unusual yet wonderful interlude, that spanned late winter, spring and summer,\nand for my COVID 'roommates.'\n*June: The Stride and Thrive fundraiser for the Kelly Gynecological Oncology Center at\nHopkins was both uplifting and rewarding. Our State College team (perhaps 15 of us,\nincluding Ben and his buddies,) 'strode'  around the Military Museum trail (or ran a 5K)\non a glorious June morning, wearing the #willapower t-shirts I had made for the\noccasion. Better yet, I raised over $7K for KEGOS! The event is usually held in Baltimore\nand I'm hoping to be sufficiently 'thriving' for a reprise of this year's performance! Who's\nwith me?\nAn offshoot of Stride and Thrive has been a  monthly get-together with up to seven\nwonderful women friends, some of whom participated in the June walk. We meet at the\nMilitary Museum early on a Sunday morning to the sound of nearby church bells, walk,\nchat, catch up and finish with a coffee at a nearby caf\u00e9.\n*August (or was it July?): Wonderful trip to Chatham, MA, with Ben for a week of pool\nlounging, reading, lobster roll eating, spa going, and relaxing. The change of scene was\nso welcome after months of cabin fever, I was feeling well, and the long drive to/from the\nCape in my new car was part of the adventure, as we listened to lots of music and\npodcasts (one about the genesis of Bob Dylan songs). I love nothing better than a fun\nroad trip with a great travel companion, and this one was memorable.\n*August-December: I enjoyed being back in the (virtual) classroom for the first time in\nover a year and hope the graduate students learned as much as I did from our seminar\non the Dreyfus Affair.\n                       633 / 1.901\n*The brightest spot this year, again, was the astounding kindness shown me throughout\nthe year by family and friends. My family has been extraordinarily caring, not just\nbecause they are family and they love me but because they are, I've concluded,\nexceptional people that I'm lucky enough to be related to! Friends from all phases of my\nlife continued to email, text, call, zoom, cook, make me laugh, read and comment on my\nblog, lend an ear, give advice, and help keep my spirits up in countless other ways. \nI want to especially thank those friends (and of course family members) who have not\nfeared, consistently, to step into the 'ring of fire,' as I call it, ie the darkest moments, the\nreports after scans and procedures, the times when I'm in physical pain, the emotionally\nand mentally fraught periods, the messy places. I understand how unpleasant and\nfrightening this can be and how it might easily trigger an avoidance mechanism.  But the\nring of fire is a ring of light! For those of you who have 'gone there' with me, I hope you\nmight feel, like I do, that there have been moments of grace in the face of extreme\nvulnerability, raw human connection, and love. Thank you for having the *courage* to\nmake your life and mine a blessing.\nFrom the existential to the mundane: today I feel pretty well. I woke up early (for me) as\nI thought a repair man was coming (he can't come until Monday, it turns out), stocked up\non groceries for Ben's visit, picked up some wine for a dish I'm making, stopped at Tait\nFarm and lastly for a cappuccino. I'm adjusting -- I think -- to the new oral chemo\nregimen + taking my blood pressure (showing normal readings now) + giving myself two\ninjections each day + figuring out how to deal with the insomnia Zejula can cause (I slept\npretty well last night). I am content to have a quiet night at home with a movie (I\nwatched \"Dawn Wall\" last night, a gripping documentary about free soloing) and a nice\ndinner (I'm thinking linguine in lemon cream sauce). These days I try to 'dedramatize'\nNYE, plus I have Ben's visit to look forward to on Sunday!\nWishing everyone good health, happiness, personal prosperity, creativity, laughs, and\nblessings in the new year. \n***********************************************\nAnd this is what I wrote a year ago today:\nHappily ensconced in Ben's bedroom in the row house where he lives on M Street,\noverlooking the small housing project and the huge white church that takes up almost a\ncity block (the United House of Prayer for All People of the Church of the Rock of the\nApostolic Faith). Ben and Sammi are in NYC for NYE, but I am here, cozily on this mild\nday, winding down the year (and decade). My friend/ex-bf Jeff met me for a while to\nselect some goodies at Buttercream Bakery, before sitting outside in the sun at La\nColombe cafe in Blagden Alley, catching up and trading tales as we like to do (see pic).\n                       634 / 1.901\nHeaded to Baltimore at some point tomorrow. The PET-CT scan on Thursday, the results\nof which I will discuss that day with the interventional radiologist (Dr. Holly), will\ndetermine whether the procedure to repair my fistula laparoscopically can go forward\nthe next day. If the scan reveals significant fluid collection, for example (that niggling\nstomach abscess...), the procedure may well be off, to be replaced by an open surgery at\nanother date. There are no guarantees. I hope for the best outcome, but need to be\nprepared for a different one. I am not certain if the PET will also screen for any new or\nresidual cancer, but I presume it will. I'll also meet with my gyn onc, Dr. Beavis, on\nThursday afternoon.\nIn no way has cancer been a 'blessing,' in no way am I 'grateful' for having this disease.\nIn no way do I feel that \"God does not give you more than you can handle\" and/or\n\"everything happens for a reason.\" I understand that this counters the belief of several\nreligious traditions that find value in suffering. In no way was spending the night before\nmy 'mother of all surgeries' retching into a garbage can in my hotel room while my\nfamily looked on helplessly a redeeming experience, nor was the crushing post-chemo\nfatigue that had me waking up from seventeen-hour slumbers in a stunned stupor, nor\nwas feeling so overwhelmed I could scarcely make myself a cup of tea, nor was the fact\nof missing at least three friends' weddings and a long-planned trip to France with Ben,\nnor was having my entire life come crashing down around me, leaving me to grapple\nwith the possibility of a shorter than hoped-for lifespan.\nAnd yet...\nI will simply echo the measured words of my rabbi, David Ostrich, during a visit he paid\nme shortly after I returned home from my three-week post-surgery stay at Hopkins: \"You\nmay find that this experience offers some opportunity for learning:\"\n*I am stronger than I thought, both physically and mentally. It surprised me to learn that\nsome cancer patients, even at early stages of their treatment, feel they simply can't\ncontinue with it. Except for a few rare instants when feeling particularly debilitated and\noverwhelmed, this has never been my attitude. I'm still feeling well enough, and tough\nenough now, to say \"bring it on.\" I will keep fighting if need be (and it may very well be,\ngiven the likelihood of a recurrence...)\n*Goodness exists, and it is powerful. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, and while fully\nconscious of the fact that evil, ugliness, and mean-spiritedness also exist in spades\n(examples too numerous to mention here, and in our faces every day), let me quote\nAnne Frank: \"It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and\nimpractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people\nare truly good at heart.\" One friend brought me a hamsa (protective hand symbol) that\nher mother had blessed at the Kotel in Jerusalem; another came by my house to check\non me when Ben and Michael were worried because they couldn't contact me (I was\n                       635 / 1.901\ndeep into one of the aforementioned post-chemo big sleeps); another prepared a picnic\nand drove me to sit beside a calming creek on a gorgeous summer day; another drove\nme, twice, from State College to Baltimore; three others came to spend weekends with\nme, to help out with whatever was needed; others ran errands, made chicken noodle\nsoup, borscht, quiche, rice pudding (the prodigious Meal Train kept me fed for months...),\ntexted, called, emailed, sent cards, gorgeous floral arrangements, and other thoughtful\ngifts (one friend, envisioning me in a hospital gown, sent a colorful, elegant scarf),\nprayed, visited, drove me to doctors' appointments, slept over when I was feeling shaky,\nsat with me during chemo, brought me milkshakes when that was virtually all I could\nstomach, invited me on outings as I continued to improve, took care of everything I left\nhanging at work when I had to schedule surgery on short notice, added encouraging and\nperceptive comments to this page. My family members have continued to provide rock\nsolid love and support, accompanying me to Baltimore, providing strong arms to lean on\nwhen my post-surgery 'walks' extended to the house next door, and keeping up a\ncourageous front despite their fear. ETC. Goodness is restorative (and really beautiful\nand pure!). It manifests itself in countless ways. It continues to be an essential element\nin my recovery. I do feel privileged to have witnessed so many instances of grace.\nPerhaps, in some ways, I have learned to be a 'better' (ie kinder, more empathic) version\nof myself, too. I would be glad for that.\n*As I wrote earlier about my upcoming procedure, there are no guarantees. But I think I\nreally understand this now. It's become easier to say \"I love you\" -- and mean it -- to\nfriends and family. And I hold those hugs for longer, and squeeze tighter. No filter. No\nb.s. No day but today.\n*I am intoxicated by life, and unready to leave it.\nThat's what I've learned so far.\nWishing everyone a healthy, happy, successful, fun, peaceful, loving and blessed new\nyear.\nLove, Willa",

    "entry": "638 / 1.901\n                       639 / 1.901\nI haven't provided an update in a while so I just wanted to assure everyone that health-\nwise things are status quo for now. The Zejula makes me slightly nauseous (in which\ncase I pop a Zofran) and has elevated my blood pressure a bit (but not into dangerous\nterritory, which is good). My last round of blood work revealed some 'renal insufficiency' -\nmy kidneys are working hard to flush out all the toxins and it is crucial for me to stay\nhydrated. I think my liver numbers looked a bit 'wonky' as well for the same reason. I'll\nhave more blood work done on Tuesday, including a test targeting kidney function. On\nthe whole I've been sleeping better than a week or so ago, when I contended with a bout\nof bad insomnia. Also somewhat troubling is a huge black and blue mark as well as quite\na few smaller ones where I've injected myself with Lovenox (blood thinner) twice daily\n(I'm doing this because my last CT scan revealed two tiny blood clots, one in my lung the\nother in my leg - these were *overlooked* by the Geisinger radiologists but fortunately\nthe Hopkins radiologists identified them). As I'm far from an expert in giving myself\nshots, I am likely not doing it perfectly and it's probably causing some mild trauma to the\ninjection sites. When I showed my beat-up looking legs to the nurse practitioner last\nweek (as well as a few spots where the injection site also felt slightly swollen) she told\nme it was nothing to worry about. However, tomorrow I'm going to send a picture of my\n'not ready for swimsuit weather' gams to Dr. Beavis' nurse and see what she has to say.\nPerhaps because of the blood thinner I'm more susceptible to bruising. More battle scars!\nI was overjoyed, of course, to have Ben home this week. We had a lot of fun just hanging\nout, watching a movie (\"City of Gold,\" an intriguing documentary about the late LA food\ncritic, Jonathan Gold), taking a drive, eating nice home cooked meals etc. Wednesday we\nwere riveted to CNN, watching the ghastly, dismaying, unbelievable events unfold at the\nCapitol. I still feel traumatized by having witnessed such desecration. Friday night I felt\ncompelled to try to usher in 'sabbath peace' (shabbat shalom) and to glean some Jewish\nperspectives on the tragedy, so I streamed the service at Sixth & I, a well-known\nprogressive synagogue in D.C. The rabbi spoke about the power of the visual, of 'seeing\nis believing,' comparing Moses' shock and anger at witnessing the Israelites worshipping\nthe Golden Calf when he descended from Mt. Sinai to the horror many of us felt faced\nwith such abhorrent images. We're starting the book of Exodus now: things got worse\nbefore they got better...\nIn any event, Ben is here (actually at Michael's) until Tuesday and I hope to see him\nbriefly tomorrow. He is doing well and it was comforting to know that he was sleeping in\nhis 'lair' upstairs. He will meet up with Sammi for a few nights' getaway in the Poconos\nbefore they return to Brooklyn and to work and school.\n...I will be doing the same this week, getting my syllabus ready for the first week of class\n(beginning the 19th) and taking care of department business, while also pressing ahead\non a writing project.\n                       640 / 1.901\nMy monthly walk at the Military Museum w/my #willapower friends (five of us today), on\na brisk yet sunny January morning, was lovely. We were all so worked up about politics\nthat there was hardly time for other catch up, but that's what's preoccupying us right\nnow.\nPhotos\n                       641 / 1.901\n                       642 / 1.901",

    "entry": "The briefest of updates as I haven't written in a while. Our semester begins tomorrow\nand I've been busy preparing while continuing to take care of department business. I'm\nteaching my undergraduate course on France and the Holocaust in Film and Literature,\nwhich is always a meaningful experience for me (and hopefully the students). No trip to\nParis over spring break in conjunction with the course this semester, however (sadly). In\nfact, because of COVID concerns we don't even get a spring break this term, but three\n'wellness days\" instead (I will need them, for sure).\nI am feeling alright, pretty much status quo. Dr. Patel lowered my dose of Lovenox (blood\nthinner) b/c it was thinning my blood too much. I am still giving myself two injections per\nday in my thigh or belly, and those areas still look beat up, black and blue. I should be\n                       643 / 1.901\nable to switch to Coumedin or some other blood thinner soon, which can be taken orally.\nI am not even sure why my oncs opted for injections now; perhaps they are more\neffective. As long as they have successfully resolved the two tiny clots the CT scan\nshowed up.\nThe Zejula (oral chemo med) still makes me slightly nauseous (Zofran helps with that)\nbut the worse/worst side effect is insomnia, especially now that the semester is starting.\nCalming music, regular bedtime routine etc. do not seem to help (but must avoid screen\ntime....). I'm switching to taking it in the morning in the hope that some of Zejula's\nintensity may have worn off by bedtime. Grrr.\nI'll have my blood checked tomorrow or W and I guess it will be time for my CA125\nnumber to be checked too. And perhaps my kidney function too. I undergo so many\n'checks' that it's honestly hard to keep track sometimes, esp. w/everything else going\non. This is where my sometimes less than stellar organization skills fail me, but I am\ntrying to keep on top of things. \nThe title of my post today is of course the title of MLK's last book, _Where do we go from\nhere?: Chaos or community._ This question has been resonating with me, of course on\nMLK's bday but also in light of all the recent turmoil in our country. Let's hope next time I\nwrite we'll have a new president and VP in place, and that the transition will have been\npeaceful. Good riddance to the wicked man. \nI expect to have news to share soon.\nOn a lighter note (see YouTube clip): Heigh-ho!",

    "date": "January 24, 2021",
    "entry": "I have some very big news to share: in June of this year I'll be retiring from Penn State,\nafter thirty-three years of service.\nIt all started one day last semester, when I surprised myself by blurting out loudly, when\nI was at home alone: \"I want to retire and move back to New York.\" As this seemed a\ndirective shooting directly from my unconscious into my conscious state -- much like the\nexperience of waking up with a start from a half-dream and yelling something out loud --\nI thought I should listen to that voice.\nBut in fact it took me months to figure out how to respond to that it. On one hand: I love\nmy job, adore teaching, my colleagues, my department, university settings, academic\nlife, walking briskly through a bustling campus as classes change, schmoozing in my\ncolleagues' offices. Being an academic is part of my core identity, and Penn State has\nbeen my safe space since I was 29. \nWouldn't it be ill-advised to give that up?\nOn the other: I am battling advanced ovarian cancer that may well recur (necessitating\nanother course of debilitating IV chemo). It's become nearly impossible for me to\nmarshal the necessary time and physical and emotional wherewithal needed to give\nmyself the best shot at maintaining the best possible quality of life for as long as\npossible while carrying on the various parts of my job (teaching, research, department\nheadship) with the intensity and focus they deserve, and require. Stress is particularly\nwearing on me as a cancer patient, as are the side effects of my medications, the many\nmedical appointments I must keep, the blood tests and CT/PET scans, and all the rest.\nFor months both my oncologists have been encouraging me to consider retirement. Dr.\n                       645 / 1.901\nBeavis said: \"I think it will be better for your mental health, which in turn will be better\nfor your physical health.\" Shouldn't I give weight to the recommendations of my medical\nteam?\nOf course, but isn't focusing my energies on a job I love and find meaningful equally\ntherapeutic?\" Don't many cancer patients continue to work? Can't I just 'tough it out' and\n'power through' as I've been doing for decades?\nIn the end, I think it's time for me to be realistic about my situation. The decision,\nthough, was agonizing.\n\"...and move back to New York.\" I'm not sure when I might follow through on that plan,\nas the voice told me to do, but I do know that I also want to ensure that I have a \"post-\nPenn State chapter\" to my life. I am aware of the odds against long-term survival of OC\n(although I continue to be inspired by the stories of women who have thrived for years\nwith the disease, effectively beating it). The other day, I posted an envious comment on\na friend's Facebook photo of Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs in Coney Island, where my\nfriend had stopped for a few of those mouth-watering dogs and some fries after visiting\nhis mother. \"Next time you're in the city,\" he responded, \"let's meet in Coney Island and\ngo to Nathan's. The hot dogs will taste better there.\" The luxury of spending a sunny\nweekday in Coney Island with a friend -- strolling on the boardwalk, dipping my feet in\nthe ocean, enjoying the guilty pleasure of a dog w/kraut and extra mustard -- makes me\npositively giddy with excitement. To further encourage pleasurable forward thinking, my\nrecently-retired friend and former colleague Monique sent me a series of tantalizing\nimages: a lavender field in Provence; an open-air seafood restaurant, perhaps near the\nCape, at sunset;the Eiffel Tower.\nAnother fear: does retiring mean that cancer has 'won,' that it eventually wore me down\nto the point at which I could no longer devote myself single-mindedly to my professional\nlife? Or, conversely, does it mean that I am making a mindful choice to take on this\nfucking disease in optimal conditions?\nOf course, there is fear of the unknown, of sea change. It's in a way comparable to my\ndivorce (but much less traumatically so) in that the future seems a blank slate, defying\nmy attempts to fully envision it. It's a 'down the rabbit hole,' 'through the looking glass\nmoment.' But the next chapter will be mine to write (w/apologies for that trite image).\n...but speaking of writing, I do intend to remain an active researcher/writer (w/more time\nto devote to those pleasures), will remain at the helm of the doctoral committee that I\nchair and member of several others of which I'm a member; will attend conferences and\ncampus events; and hope to stay connected in other ways.\nI'll miss my colleagues (esp my those who are *friends*) terribly. They are my tribe.\n                       646 / 1.901\nAnother fear: finances. over the past several months my financial advisor and I have run\nthe numbers several times as has my TIAA-CREF advisor. I should be more than ok,\nmeaning that I should have at least as much to live on per month as I do now. That's a\nreassuring thought. But it's more or less a finite sum. And it's strange to imagine not\nhaving income (although I hope some short-term teachings gigs etc. will eventually come\nmy way). I'm bad with budgets, and enjoy a free-spending lifestyle. I'll need to manage\nmy finances better, and curtail my frequent impulse buying (which should not be hard,\nas I have *plenty* of everything).\nI can't wait to travel again as soon as it's safe, and hope to spend more time in the city\nwith friends and family. I like the idea of coming full circle. I've been transfixed by\ndescriptions and images of the cool apartments I could rent (let's hope that the rents\nstay as reasonable as they have been, due to New Yorkers leaving the city during\nCOVID). There's a new building on the LES (Essex Street) atop a fabulous foodie heaven\nmarket, boasting an exercise room full of Peloton bikes and a rooftop pool. I think I could\npicture myself there, on a high floor with views of the East River and the bridges. It's\nmagical at night.\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. There will be an adjustment period I'm sure, and I'll\nmore than likely take ample time to downsize, purging my boxes and boxes of files, class\nnotes etc., and to get used to the new normal.\nIt's been wrenching to share the news with colleagues. Tears have been shed all around.\nThe Dean has been very supportive. I feel emotionally drained.\nI hope I am making the right choice and that a higher power (and my own fortitude) will\ngrant me the good health to enjoy what lies ahead.\nIn other news, if all goes as planned I'll be receiving the first does of the COVID vaccine\nthis Friday!",

At least\none of those committees is for one of my advisees, so I'm happy about that.\nCongratulations, too, on getting cleared to get the vaccine--I remember that for awhile,\nthe doctors were uncertain, so I hope that being able to get it will help you jump into\nyour new life with both feet!

Xxxx\n  \u2014Cheryl Glenn, January 26, 2021  \nDearest Willa,\nI think you are on to something very good. Ideas that come to you in your quietest\nmoments are meaningful. You have been giving the idea of retirement quite a bit of\nthought and moving back to NYC is a natural. I will eagerly watch your journey forwards.\n  \u2014Marlene Green, January 26, 2021  \nWilla, this sounds like a wonderful decision!

    "entry": "Good health news today: my CA125 level (OC marker) is 13 this month, down from 15.7\nlast month. Anything over 38 may be a warning sign. I was *overjoyed* and energized to\nreceive this news. This means that the Zejula (chemo pill that I take daily) appears to be\nworking. May it continue!! In my mind \"I'm only as healthy as my last CA125 test or CT-\nscan,\" but at the very least this means I have another 'reprieve' for a month. I'll take it!\nThe full blood panel returned numbers that are also 'stable.' That's good too. \nTomorrow I'll get my first COVID shot at a hospital in Lewistown, about 25 miles from\nhere. That's another piece of good news. I will be grateful for this extra layer of\nprotection. Of course, I hope nothing untoward happens (eg allergic reaction), but if does\nI'll be in the best possible setting to be treated.\nI've been telling Penn State people little by little about my retirement. I want to tell as\nmany people as I can in person (albeit virtually). Today I shared the news with our\ngraduate students. They were extraordinarily kind, caring, and gracious. Several were\ncrying and others wrote me touching notes afterwards. I want to be able to be 'in the\nmoment' to the greatest extent possible, to be present for this outpouring of compassion\nand honesty. I'm trying, but to be honest it's emotionally overwhelming, as this entire\nprocess of decision-making and its aftermath has been.\nA few more random thoughts on my retirement (I'm sure there will be others going\nforward):\n>It's rather a shame that I'm 'going out at the top of my game,' so to speak. I hope this\ndoesn't sound vain, but in many ways, I feel like I'm at the apogee of my career in terms\nof expertise, skill and experience in the classroom, sharpness of critical thinking and\ncreativity etc. I really feel like I'm nailing it in the classroom this semester, partly out of a\ndesire, I suppose, to 'leave it all on the floor' before I go. I don't know if there's a causal\nlink, but the students seem highly engaged. Maybe I just got lucky with an excellent\nclass. And the Zoom format is really not bad. I learned how to use some new tools that\n                       651 / 1.901\nthe students seem to enjoy (including one that lets the entire class annotate a document\ntogether). Although nothing can substitute for F2F teaching, Zoom is not the horror I\nimagined it might be.\nPerhaps it's good, though, that I'm leaving 'at the top of my game.' As my friend Cheryl\nGlenn wisely pointed out, I'm leaving on my own terms. The wheels are in motion\nbecause of my decision. ('m being proactive (although I arguably could have made the\ndecision before Fall semester, for example, but clearly I wasn't ready yet). No 'epic fail'\nlike two springs ago, when everything fell to pieces when I was diagnosed in May 2019\nand literally had to run out of the office, leaving papers and files and books strewn\neverywhere, to start scrambling to get treatment set up.\n>A minor point, perhaps (and completely unrelated to my last one), my financial advisor\nand friend, Deb Guerrero (who has been immensely helpful during this entire period)\nreminded me that my investments will continue to generate income. Financially, this is\nnot a zero sum game. Further reassurance that financially things should be ok for me.\n>Having made my decision, I am actually starting to feel better physically (and\nmentally). Perhaps it's the Zejula working its magic, but I am also simply feeling\nprogressively 'lighter' as I begin this countdown period (26 class sessions to go). I will\nprobably be a mess on the last day of class. It's all so bittersweet.\nBe well, everyone and THANK YOU for the many supportive comments on my last entry\n(in addition to emails and texts). I will *try* to respond to your posts if I can.",

I say' basically status quo' because I was feeling somewhat under the\nweather today. I've had a headache for the past two days, which I just managed to rid\nmyself of by lying down for a while. The headache in turn made me quite nauseous; I set\nout for the supermarket this afternoon to pick up a few items but actually decided to turn\naround and return home as a wave of nausea overtook me. My right side (ie my 'bad'\nside, on which I was operated last March to resolve a fistula) is feeling slightly sore,\nwhich always makes me nervous. I have a big welt on my right thigh where I had been\ngiving myself injections of blood thinner until about two weeks ago. Is it normal that it\nhasn't gone down yet? Finally, I don't have much appetite so I'm just going to eat a\nbaked sweet potato for dinner.\nI wouldn't describe any of these symptoms as acute, and as I'd been feeling pretty well\nfor the past week or so I'll wait and see what happens. I did query Dr. Patel's nurse about\nthe welt. It's very easy for me to become anxious and dive into worst case scenario land\n(recurrence? another fistula?) so I need to try to stay grounded in the present. I think\ngetting over the retirement decision 'hump, which involved very honest, authentic yet\nemotionally-charged conversations with colleagues, staff, students, administrators etc.,\nhas been rather draining. I'm increasingly at peace with the decision but enacting it is\nhard work.\nIn better news, I did get my first COVID shot. Had to drive about 25 miles to the hospital\nin Lewistown, but the setup was excellent, very professional. I told the pharmacist who\ninoculated me to be quick to act if I had an allergic reaction, but everything went\nsmoothly. The staff keeps an eye on everyone who's just been vaccinated for half an\nhour afterwards, to make sure no one falls ill. I'll have my second shot on Feb. 26th.\nStrangely, I spent most of my weekend obsessively researching my family's genealogy.\nI've conducted this type of research for many years in the context of my own work, and\ndefinitely have the skill set to dig deep. It's odd that I've never used these skills to learn\nmore about my own ancestry (I'm addicted to Henry Louis Gates' show, Finding your\nRoots, and fantasize about being his 'ordinary person' guest one day!). I think part of my\nmotivation derives from wanting to come full circle somehow, to reconnect with my roots\nduring this 'existential' phase of my life (it's akin to my desire to return to my\nhometown). Anyway, I unearthed all sorts of documents (ships' manifests, divorce\nrecords). I learned that my great grandfather William Goldberg (a 'card-carrying\nCommunist' in Vilna, according to one genealogy site), after whom I'm named, was\nactually born....David Cohen (all the names were changed when the various strands of\nthe family arrived in the States from E. Europe). I also confirmed that at least one of my\ngreat-grandmother's sisters, as well as my great-grandfather's first wife, died in a\nconcentration camp. So many questions. Writing all this up as a kind of 'memory book'\n                       656 / 1.901\nseems an attractive retirement project.\nFinally, for the second year in a row I hope to participate in the Kelly Gynecologic\nOncology Service's (Johns Hopkins) \"Below the Belt\" Stride and Thrive fundraiser, a 5K\nrun or 1K walk that will take place on 6 June 2021. The event will again be virtual this\nyear (instead of taking place in Baltimore), so I hope State College friends will join me\nagain (we had much fun last year) and that others may consider running/walking\nwherever you may find yourself on that date (or come join us in Happy Valley, if the\nCOVID coast is clear[er]). You can make a donation at any point to my team,\n#willapower, via this link:https://runsignup.com/willapower\nAnd you can sign up to join my team here (I\nthink): https://runsignup.com/RaceGroups/70197\nI'm looking ahead to June with hope. This cause means a lot to me. For better or worse,\n'cancer survivor' is now a core part of my identity, and if I can pay it forward and help\nother women combat this awful disease, I'm all in.\nPic on right is my great-grandfather David Cohen aka Willy Goldberg!\nPhotos",

    "entry": "I haven't written in a while. I'm stable right now - not much to report. No news is good\nnews. I didn't feel terrific this week, though. Discomfort on my right side (my 'bad' side)\nand a kind of 'twinge' in my abdomen warranted a blood test, which revealed elevated\nliver marker numbers. Three nights of awful insomnia did not help. But my visit with the\nnurse practitioner yesterday was reassuring: the liver numbers are, apparently, not\nworrisomely high, and a follow-up bilirubin test Dr. Patel ordered yielded normal results.\nMoreover, the nurse practitioner felt nothing abnormal on palpating my entire abdominal\narea. This was a reassuring report. This morning I slept until 11 a.m. and feel *much*\nbetter. The next 'fingers crossed' moment will occur on W, when my all-important CA 125\nlevel will be assessed via bloodwork. Next Friday I'll receive my second dose of the\n                       658 / 1.901\nCOVID vaccine.\nWe've been in a deep freeze for several weeks -- lots of snow, sleet, subfreezing temps.\nEnormous icicles hang from the exterior of my house. The icicles have icicles! I'm longing\nfor warmer weather. Hoping to absorb some of that powerful energy I feel when the sun\nmoves into Pisces, which means that my birthday is around the bend!\nI had a strange dream last night, during my deep eleven hour slumber. A notable aspect\nof it was that it was 'framed:' I was recounting a story to someone, which then played\nout in the dream. I was in a house with other people, but some sort of dangerous \nsituation prompted me to flee. I then found myself outside the house, in a snow-covered\nlandscape at night, trying to escape along with a PSU colleague from Jewish Studies,\nDaniel F. [footnote 1]. We were running together through the dark cold snow, headed\ntowards a forest, when a large wild boar ran across our path and startled me. We made it\ninto the forest, when I turned and saw a huge black (or brown bear) a few yards from\nme. I stayed in place and screamed several times, hoping it would scare the bear away.\nThat didn't work. I'm not sure what happened next, but Daniel figured out a way to\nescape the scary situation by *flying* off on some sort of contraption (like an individual\nflying machine). I don't know what happened to me but presumably I escaped too.\nThe next part of the dream was different. I was also in a house but with a handsome man\nwhom I didn't recognize. Perhaps he was visiting me. I strongly wanted to be with him,\nbut my desire was thwarted by a phone call from Gail G., a friend from college [footnote\n2]. I hadn't spoken with her in a long time, and felt it would be rude to cut the call short.\nShe launched into a very detailed account of the union work she was doing (in real life\nshe is, indeed, a labor advocate and organizer), describing in minute detail the types of\nprojects she was currently working on for several unions. That's all I remember.\nfootnote 1: Daniel F., a colleague from Jewish Studies>> a) I am currently teaching my\ncross-listed FR/JST course on France and the Holocaust in Film and Literature. Mass\nkilling, death from disease and starvation, and other horrors are often on the agenda.\nThe material is very much present with me, obviously seeping into my subconscious life\nas well; b)Daniel F. did not attend our JST faculty meeting on Thursday, as he usually\ndoes, but here he was in my dream, fully present; c)Daniel F. recently lost his brother\nand parents (to COVID) in quick succession. That's a lot of death to deal with. \nfootnote 2: Gail G. >> College friend with whom I'm in touch from time to time and have\nseen several times since graduation (in PA and Cali), but still very much connected to my\ncollege years. My dream may well have pointed towards the zoom reunion in which I\nparticipated tonight with some classmates who lived in the same dorm as me in college\n(it's our reunion year, but sadly we can't be together in Cambridge so a bunch of virtual\nevents are planned). \n                       659 / 1.901\nIt's crazy how intertwined life and death, desire and death, Eros and Thanatos, the\ncoming spring w/its vitality and promise of rebirth and this long 'winter of my soul' are\nfor me these days. Both are my companions, in often shifting balance. I think my dream\nwas trying to tell me that but did not give me clues about how to balance these forces.\nAt least that's how it feels to me. [note to self: must stay off the Facebook page for\nwomen living with ovarian cancer; it's way too scary].\nOn a more prosaic note, I am greatly enjoying my teaching this semester! I have some\nwonderful students. And I'm very busy with department work and thinking about the\n(probably virtual) lecture I need to prepare for May, at the Virginia Museum of Fine Art.\nAnd looking forward to several events being planned around my retirement!",

    "entry": "The good news from this month's bloodwork is that my CA125 number -- the ovarian\ncancer marker that I await with extreme trepidation each month, steeling myself to open\nthe message containing it -- is steady at 13.4 U/ml, up from 13 last month. THANK GOD,\nas the number indicates that the parp inhibitor I take daily for maintenance is working.\nThe .4 is insignificant; the number would have needed to have increased by at least 50%\nto cause worry. And as a reminder, any number up to 38.1 is within normal range. So I\nhave a month's 'reprieve' before I need to start worrying again. YES. Every day a\nblessing.\nThe slightly less good news is that my hemoglobin level is low: 8.1 g/dL whereas it\nshould be a minimum of either 9 or 12 (I was presented with two slightly varying\nnumbers). This may explain why I have sometimes felt a bit winded recently on minimal\nphysical exertion: my red blood cells are not receiving ample enough oxygen.\nConsequently, I need to stop taking the Zejula (parp inhibitor) for now, and will have my\nblood tested again next week. Anemia is apparently quite a common side effect of taking\nZejula, as are higher than usual liver marker numbers (which I have too).\nMy immediate fear was that those nasty cancer cells would somehow detect that the\nZejula was no longer headed out to beat them up every day up and would say to each\nother: \"Come on guys, now's our chance!\" However, both Dr. Beavis and Dr. Patel's\nnurse assured me this is not the case. The medication stays in my blood stream for at\nleast a week. And many studies have shown that stoppage for even longer than that\ndoes not affect treatment. Many Zejula-takers start and stop and start. Ultimately, my\ndosage may need to be lowered. But I'm not there yet. So I'll try to up my iron rich foods\nthis coming week (I'm not a big red meat eater but a big juicy hamburger may be in my\nfuture); oddly enough, I was told to avoid liver, but I'll snag a few bags of fresh spinach\nnext time I'm at the store).\nDr. Beavis was quite reassuring and wrote: \"Please try not to worry - Dr. Patel is taking\ngreat care of you!\"  So I will indeed listen to my oncologist extraordinaire Anna Beavis\nand try not to worry. At least for now.\nI get my second COVID shot tomorrow!\nWe've had some lovely sunny days with temps in the 40s and 50s and a slant of light\nthat hints at spring. After class today I took a long drive in the country to clear my mind,\nthe farms and still snow-covered fields glistening in the sun and the creeks starting to\n                       661 / 1.901\nswell. So pretty. \nMy birthday is around the corner. Last year it fell right before my fistula-repair operation\n(on the 9th) and the onset of the pandemic. I was able to gather friends at a restaurant\nwe like for drinks and dinner. No such luck this year but I'll think about what might be\narranged.",

    "entry": "662 / 1.901\nI had a lovely birthday yesterday, and was literally deluged with social media greetings,\ncards, texts, phone calls, zoom calls, flower deliveries, other gifts, and a host of random\nacts of kindness. As I wrote on my Facebook page, an advantage (!?) of cancer is that my\nbar for happiness is set very low: any day I wake up alive and feeling reasonably well I\nam deliriously happy. Yesterday was no exception: every new message or text or card I\nread made me smile and I felt very loved! I also received several donations for my\nfundraiser for KGOS. Because I also publicly announced my retirement on social media, I\nreceived lovely messages from a number of former students, thanking me and wishing\nme well. \nIt was a busy day: I had some class prep and grading to take care of in the morning, then\nI ran out for about an hour to have my blood checked and to pick up a library book, then\nreturned for class (which went well). After that, I packed up a cooler and headed to\nSpring Creek Park, where I had invited about ten or so friends to gather for a little bday\ncelebration, w/champagne and cake. Since March was truly \"coming in like a lion\"\n                       663 / 1.901\nyesterday, it was windy and cold with an occasional ray of sun piercing the clouds, and\nwe did our best to hold down the napkins, paper plates and cups flying everywhere. We\nstayed no more than an hour but a convivial time was had by all and it was so nice to\nsee my friends 'in the flesh' instead of as simulacra on a computer screen. And the\ngurgling creek and picturesque covered bridge always cheer me.\nAlthough I received an automated message that the results of my bloodwork had come\nin yesterday - as well as, truth be told.... -- a phone message from Dr. Patel's office\nasking me to call to discuss the results -- I had decided that I would put off any unwanted\nnews until this morning. As expected (suspected?), yesterday's bloodwork showed very\nlow hemoglobin levels (even lower than last time), so I'll need to have a blood\ntransfusion on Monday. I stopped by Dr. Patel's office this afternoon to get further details\nfrom his head nurse, Kayla, who gave me a sheaf of orders to take to the lab at the\nhospital lab tomorrow so that they can run further tests on my blood (folic acid, B12,\niron, bilirubin etc.). Monday I need to be at the hospital at 7:00 (I am *not* an early riser)\nand the transfusion will take the better part of the day, but the good news is that I'll\nlikely feel much better (ie less winded and fatigued) afterwards. I'll bring my work with\nme and see what I can manage. I'm definitely bummed that in the meantime I can't take\nmy chemo med -- which is the likely culprit as far as the decrease in hemoglobin goes --\nfor one more week, two weeks, who knows. And when/if I resume it, it may be at a lower\ndose. And that means that much less Zejua in my system to combat my cancer. But the\nblood issue needs to be resolved now, before it impacts my bone marrow -- which would\nnot be good. So back to one day at a time. Ugh.\nDr. Patel was very busy, very harried, as he is sometimes, and was a bit brusque with\nme, which I can handle. He was fairly insistent on 'we have to do this first before we can\ndetermine next steps,' so he didn't have much patience for questions I had about 'what\nifs.' He assured me that I should be fine this weekend and that I will feel much more\nenergetic after the transfusion, which I don't doubt. He has so many patients. I really\nwish that Geisinger could hire another oncologist or two.\nI'll try to rest and relax as much as I can this weekend but I do have some work to take\ncare of, with two big reports due this month. Last time I had a blood transfusion I did feel\nmuch better from it, so I hope that will be the case again. I'm of course nervous about\nbeing in the hospital w/so many COVID patients there: I'm about a week out from my\nsecond COVID shot so the antibodies are still kicking in. And there are always risks\nw/transfusions, but I know the blood will be scrupulously screened beforehand -- and I'm\nthankful to whomever donated it.\nI did take a long drive today to clear my head. The sight of cows, horses, barns and fields\nin this last stretch of winter helped me relax.\nI hope to individually contact everyone who sent birthday greetings. I so appreciate the\n                       664 / 1.901\nwell wishes. It just must take me a little while. XO\nPhotos\n                       665 / 1.901\n                       666 / 1.901",

    "entry": "My transfusion appeared to go well today. It did not take as long as expected, as I was\ndone by about 12:40. My wonderful friend Maria was kind enough to drive me to the\ncancer pavilion at the hospital for 7 a.m. while my equally wonderful friend Helen picked\nme up afterwards and drove me to pick up a cappuccino. This gave us time, coming and\ngoing, to dish about the Harry-Meghan-Oprah interview and catch up on this and that.\nMaybe I've been spoiled by Hopkins (and even Geisinger here), but the care at the\nhospital seemed subpar to me. They had no records regarding my prior transfusion at\nthe hospital, my medications, previous surgeries etc. At one point, the nurse didn't seem\nto know whether I had received one bag of blood already or two. Worst, while adjusting\nmy chair, the nurse *twice* yanked on the syringe connected via a needle to my port,\nthrough which I was receiving the blood. The second time, she yanked so hard that the\nneedle came flying out of my port (which is inserted underneath the skin on my upper\nchest) along with the entire dressing covering it. It hurt like a mofo and I just had to\nscream *F***!* at the top of my lungs. The needle had to be reinserted, the syringe\ncleaned out etc. Nor terribly reassuring, when I was really looking forward to having the\nnurses take care of me. Oh well. The bottom line is that I was pumped up with two bags\nof fresh, healthy blood that will hopefully energize me and ensure that my body's getting\nsufficient oxygen. I think I feel a bit better now but I'm not entirely sure: I'm tired\nbecause I didn't sleep well, or much, last night. We'll see what tomorrow brings. The\nnurse said it might take a day or two for me to feel better. She noted that my color was\nimproved when I left the hospital; apparently, I looked somewhat ashen on arrival.\nI'll have my blood tested on Thursday and Dr. Patel will assess the hemoglobin levels. I\ndon't know when I'll be able to start taking the Zejula again. Dr. Beavis reassured me by\nletting me know that studies have shown that it can be just as effective if taken at a\nlower dose, which is what may be in store for me.\nI dozed on the couch for a while and did some work after that. The weather is turning\nmore spring-like and I want to be able to take walks and maybe some short hikes. The\nhealth issues are very frustrating but I need to take one day at a time. \n                       668 / 1.901\nMy longtime housecleaner, Liz, brought over (at my request) a tray of eggplant\nparmigiana made by her husband, Phil, a phenomenal Italian-American home cook. The\nperfect comfort food for tonight. Hope to get back on track tomorrow, and look forward\nto a 'wellness day' on Thursday (ie one of three days we are off from teaching this\nsemester in exchange for losing our spring break to COVID concerns).",
    "comments": "Transfusion Day sounded like something one will want to erase from memory. Not a\nhappy time! Oh, well, it's over and done with.

    "entry": "It's been a very chaotic week-ten days and I feel wiped out. I think I did not report here\nthat last week (or perhaps ten days ago), a few days after my transfusion, I walked into\nmy kitchen in the morning and noticed that a medium sized patch on the ceiling above\nthe fridge was wet and 'bulging;' it looked like a water-filled 'sac' of paint had dropped\ndown and was about to burst. I called the managing agent for my condo complex\nimmediately and two of their guys came over; they reported that my water heater was\nbusted and leaking into the kitchen ceiling (as I do not have a basement, my water\nheater is in a utility closet on the second floor). They recommended two plumbing\ncompanies, which I called immediately; as the first was tied up for several days, I made\narrangements for the second to come assess the damage and hopefully do the repairs.\nIn the meantime, I also called the construction company that I had used the previous\ntime this happened (leak from upstairs bathroom...) and my insurance company. I am\nthankful that the benefits of my transfusion were starting to kick in and I had the\nwherewithal, for the most part, to handle the aggravation.\nLong story short: I had to endure five days of of cohabiting with three ginormous\ndehumidifers that made it feel and sound like a blast furnace in my home; am out $3K to\npay for a new hot water heater (insurance won't cover it but it does enhance the value of\nmy home a bit); and had to deal with plumbers who were both incompetent and total\n*gonifs:* their work was so awful that they had to come back the next day and redo it\nentirely; the hot water in my kitchen sink is no more than a trickle, so I'll need to have\nthem return next week. And the owner of said plumbing company (Allied Mechanical and\nElectrical: State College friends, do *not* use them!) promised me pie in the sky (free\ninspections for several years; a stern talking to the plumbers who messed up; no extra\npayment; and all of this in writing -- which I've yet to receive). So I will definitely be on\nthe phone Monday morning w/stern words and demands.\nOy.\nMaybe this is the universe telling me to move to NY (or stay here) and become a renter.\nI have a lot of work as we get towards the end of the semester, not just for my class but\nfor the department (evaluations of colleagues, all sorts of reports, budget stuff,\nproposals to be submitted before I retire etc.). I'm running a bit late on some tasks partly\nb/c of the chaos of the past ten days. And taxes!\nOy.\n                       670 / 1.901\nA friend with whom I took a walk on Sunday with a group of other lovely women (we\nmeet once a month) tested positive for COVID, along with several family members. I feel\nterribly for her. This prompted me though to hastily schedule a COVID test for this\nmorning. Even though I'm fully vaccinated, even though we were walking outside and my\nfriend was fully masked (I took my mask off a few times to inhale some extra oxygen), I\nwant to be extra careful for *Ben's* sake, as he's coming home tomorrow to spend a\nweek here. I'll get the results in 2-7 days. Further, I queried both my PCP and my\noncologist here; both consider me 'low risk' to either contract or transmit COVID. The\nCDC guidelines confirm this: vaccinated people (vaccinatees?) apparently can be around\npeople with COVID if they follow precautions (masking etc.). The CDC would only advise\ntesting if I became symptomatic.\nBut it's all in the scheme of things. There is better news:\nDid I mention that Ben is coming home tomorrow for a week??! Which means, among\nother things, that we may be able to have a little seder together, like we did last year,\nfor Passover. He'll be very busy with schoolwork, as will I, but it will be terrific to have\nhim here!\nOf course as all this chaos is occurring I am also running weekly to the lab for bloodwork,\nsending messages to Dr. Patel's nurse via the Geisinger portal, debriefing about my\nbloodwork with the pharmacist who works with Dr. Patel and who calls me every time\nnew results come in (she's specializes in cancer meds such as Zejula), setting up\ndelivery times for my Zejula ETC. ETC. A job in itself.\nSo Annie (the pharmacist) called shortly before I both went to get my COVID test and\ngreeted the contractor assessing the kitchen ceiling damage. Thank God my numbers\nare still stable overall, despite being slightly low or high here or there. My hemoglobin\nlevel is inching back up to normal range (it had cratered as a result of my taking 200 mg\nof Zejula [which caused me to be very winded], now cut in half to 100 mg daily). My\nkidney function number was a bit off but we both feel certain that it was because I was\ndehydrated; I distinctly remember leaving my drink in the car by accident as I walked\ninto the lab and thinking to myself: \"I'm thirsty, and I know it's going to affect my\nnumbers.\" Next labs in two weeks.\nFinally, my all-important CA125 number is considered stable. It's risen from 13.4 last\nmonth to 17.1 this month; an increase of 3.7. Of course I worry about that slight upward\ntrend two months in a row, but Annie reminded me that anything up to 38 is normal, and\nI'm still more than 50% under that. The drs. start to worry with very notable increases\n(such as doubling), whereas a slight variation like this can be due to any number of\nfactors (stress, dehydration etc.). So I will simply decide not to worry about this for a\nmonth, until my next test. Thankfully, all my numbers have been generally stable for the\npast 5-6 months. I'll take it. Every day a blessing!\n                       671 / 1.901",

    "entry": "673 / 1.901\n                       674 / 1.901\nIt's been quite a while since I've written. Everything's accelerating as we hurtle towards\nthe end of the semester, with four weeks to go. That means it's the season for reports --\npre-tenure review reports, senior faculty review reports, annual faculty evaluation\nreports (following hour-long meetings w/most of my colleagues), graduate student\nevaluation reports, an external tenure and promotion review to complete, lots of grading,\nand a whole bunch of other work -- plus my paper to revise for a virtual lecture to the\nCouncil of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts next month. I'm trying to be fairly single-\nminded in my approach to checking items off my list -- for the last time. Eight more class\nsessions left and then it's over and out. This class has been a joy and I'll be sad to leave\nthe students. Work will likely extend through May -- preparing next year's budget,\nfinishing up some admin work -- and cleaning out my office!\nI'm feeling pretty well overall. My blood counts have been relatively stable (a little high\nhere, a little low there), my energy is pretty good (a mile walk is no problem, for\nexample), stamina good, appetite robust (I've gained about five pounds of the twenty\nI've lost over the past two years, but no worries), sleep better since the dose of my parp\ninhibitor was lowered. I will see Dr. Patel this week for a check in, then have my CA 125\nlevel tested in about two weeks. The sword of Damocles is always hanging over me,\nthough. Try as I might to 'be in the moment' (and I've gotten pretty good at that), there's\nalways that niggling fear: \"Is cancer trying to make quick work of me?\" \"I'm only as\nhealthy as my last blood test/scan\" \"Ok, I guess I know how I'll be spending my summer\nnow....\" Because of course my cancer could recur at any time, as advanced ovarian\ncancer does. The \"honeymoon periods\" might be considered feints, a tease, un leurre, a\nbait and switch. And that sucks. But each day at a time, yes, yes...\nEaster is of course the day I drove myself to the ER in a panic two years ago because I\nknew something was wrong; I had never had constipation that severe, compounded by\nthat slight yet persistent bloating.. Thankfully, the ER was my default option when I\nlearned there would be a several hour wait at MedExpress, where I'm convinced they\nwould have simply sent me home with some Mirolax. I knew something was up when the\nradiology technician looked at me quizzically and said \"How long have you been feeling\nthis way?\" followed by \"Good luck\" -- rather ominously, I thought -- when I left. The\nimaging was a mess, of course: lesions in my colon, likely presence of a malignancy,\nabnormalities in several spots (I've actually blocked out their names -- oh yes, the\nomentum --  but eventually Dr. Beavis either removed those areas or as many cancerous\nbits as she could from them). That was Easter 2019; so much for redemption.\nBut I've only given that a passing thought because Ben is 26 today and that is wonderful.\nSo glad that my body was able to help create, house, nourish and give birth to him well\nbefore it came under attack. He's doing so well, and I loved hearing about his foodie\nadventures in the city -- a day of sampling dumplings and noodles in Flushing yesterday;\n                       675 / 1.901\nIsraeli brunch in Park Slope this morning. He was also home for a week recently and we\nwere able to enjoy a simple seder together. I had the stamina to make chicken matzah\nball soup, sweet and sour brisket, matzah stuffing, tzimmes, and lemon macaroons.\nSomehow I also managed to pull off a Passover meal last year, right after I had my fistula\noperation. Don't quite know how I did it (this year I felt much more peppy), but I do know\nI have a strong life force. One of my retirement projects is to compile all the family\nholiday recipes (some barely legible through the food stains) and pass them on to Ben.\nI've taken to exploring backroads around here; it's so very pretty and peaceful in the\nspring. The trees are about to bloom (I counted three nests in them on my walk today)\nand it reminds me of when Ben was born: spring was coming into life and 'blooming,' and\nso was my baby boy (we were jolted into a harsher reality a few weeks later when I sat\ndown to nurse him one morning, turned on the t.v., and witnessed the horrifying\naftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing). In any event, there's a scenic road along\nPenn's Creek that delights me; yesterday, people were fly fishing in the creek (some of\nyou may know about my strange obsession w/fly fishing and my long-held desire to take\nit up) and the Amish buggies were rolling down the twisting and turning road (just ignore\nall the Trump signs.....; the flip side of 'quaint' and 'rural'). Stopped at an Amish farm to\npick up local eggs, honey, horseradish and a bunch of pussy willows; drove to another to\nbuy their maple syrup.\nI'm all vaccinated and yearning for a change of scene. Hope to get to the city next\nmonth. Longing to plunk down in a beach chair by the ocean or even a pool w/a good\nnovel. Anyone want to join me? I would even consider going myself - the Jersey,\nMaryland and Delaware beaches are within striking distance.\nP.S. Also participated in a virtual reunion w/my freshman dorm mates, which was\nfabulous! So very happy to reconnect with several people I used to like -- as 18-year-\nolds, anyway. :) \nPhotos\n                       676 / 1.901\n                       677 / 1.901\n                       678 / 1.901\n                       679 / 1.901",

    "entry": "I met w/Dr. Patel a few days ago for my three month check-in/check-up. He spent about\n30 mn w/me so I did not feel rushed. Bottom line: as of today, I am stable; \"you're doing\ngood,\" he told me in his lilting Indian accent. When I ask him for predictions or detailed\n                       681 / 1.901\nprognoses -- I should know better at this point not to do so -- he won't go there with me.\nIt's enough for me to hear his reply when I ask him if there's any reasonable chance that\nmy cancer *won't* recur: \"That's not the likely scenario.\" I know this too, of course; it's\nnot pleasant to hear, but it's a needed reality check. Dr. Patel's m.o. is all about keeping\nme grounded in the present: \"Don't worry about what you can't control;\" \"Enjoy the good\ndays\" [implication: there will most likely be bad ones to come]; \"Go spend time with your\nson\" (Dr. P will even give me a 'pass' if I want to skip blood work for a few weeks). So I\nrecalibrate and refocus on what I can control: take the Zejula (oral chemo med) daily, try\nto eat healthily (but have gained back nearly *ten* of the twenty pounds I had lost since\nmy first surgery; blame my now quite hearty appetite, I suppose...); try to sleep well\n(doing a bit better on that front recently); hydrate, hydrate, hydrate (it's crucial that my\nkidneys function well, just as it's essential that my bone marrow remain robust );  stay as\nemotionally and psychologically buoyant as possible. Recenter myself in the present;\ncultivate gratitude; carpe diem. I'm actually doing pretty well on all these fronts, but the\nannoying thing is not being able to make plans (eg for travel, now that us vaccinated folk\nare starting to circulate again), as I could have a recurrence *at any time.* The key may\nlie in spontaneity: look into last minute travel deals; hop in my car and head to a cute\nbeachfront bnb for the weekend; set my sights on New York as soon as the end of\nsemester frenzy eases.\nBlood work coming up on Friday, including testing CA125 level. Praying for another\nmonth-long reprieve if those results look good. Nervous about the slight upward trend\n(11>13>17) of the CA125 but hoping that creep is not significant (if it inches into the\n20s or certainly the 30s it's time to see what's going on, which likely will mean a scan).\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself again. Stay in the moment. Refocus. Breathe. Rinse and\nrepeat.\nI'm powering through the last weeks of the semester with a lot of juice; worked hard all\nday today except for a break to take a leisurely stroll w/two women friends. Time now for\ndinner and pre-bedtime decompression (=junk t.v.). Forgive my somewhat telegraphic\ndelivery here. More soon.\n \nPhotos\n                       682 / 1.901",

    "entry": "687 / 1.901\n                       688 / 1.901\nIt's been quite a while since I've written. I'll blame it on a frantically hectic end of\nsemester. Health update first: thankfully, I've been enjoying a good stretch (five\nmonths?) of feeling pretty darn well. The liver numbers seemed somewhat disquieting to\nme, but Dr. Patel and two of his nurses feel that, although higher than they should be,\nthe liver counts are not a major cause for concern at this point. I'll have my blood tested\non Thursday, including for my CA125 number. I feel well, but know that those aggressive\ncancer cells (not sure if that's the 'carcinoma' or 'sarcoma' part of my diagnosis) could\nrebel at any time. \"Is it possible that my cancer won't recur?\" I asked Dr. Patel, meekly.\n\"That's not the likely scenario [once you've already had one recurrence, as you have],\"\nsays he (which of course, I tell myself, entering the realm of magical thinking, doesn't\nmean that no further recurrences is *an impossibility...*)  . So I continue to lead two\nlives: my everyday life, in which I go about my business, grade the papers, grocery shop,\nmake plans to meet friends for coffee, and - at least recently, as I found myself saying\nout loud to myself one day -- feel \"almost normal\" (how exotic) and my \"shadow life,\" the\none in which I'm consumed by thoughts of my mortality (I'm now super intrigued by the\nidea of a \"living funeral,\" although apparently I'm nowhere near that point yet), fixated\non counts and numbers, hyper-focused on my body, shaken when a survivor/subscriber\nto an OC chat room I belong to \"gains her wings\" (in online parlance). Must stay in the\nmoment. Must.stay.in.the.moment. MUST STAY IN THE MOMENT.\nBut for now, it's (almost) summertime, and the livin' is eas (-ier). I am in the city for the\nfirst time since Dec. 2019 and it feels great! First, my apologies to any NY friends and\nfamily whom I won't get to see on this initial, relatively quick trip back, during which I am\nchoosing to spend time with immediate family (it\u2019s been well over a year) and a few\nclose friends. If my health remains stable, I definitely plan to make a return trip over the\nsummer and will arrange to see other dear ones who I couldn\u2019t meet this time.\nThe hugs are terrific. All over the city, people are hugging. Long, tight embraces after\nmonths, if not years of separation, hugs full of love, joy and relief, as if to say: \u201cIt\u2019s been\nan unreasonably long wait, getting through the pandemic was hell, but we made it, and\nthis time I\u2019m not letting you go!\u201d But there seems to be \u2018first hug\u2019 etiquette. I leaned in,\ninstinctively, towards my college pal Bryan, whom I hadn\u2019t seen in a year and a half,\nbefore he stopped me to make sure that my immune system could handle a hug,\noffering an elbow bump instead. When I assured him I was both fully vaxxed and feeling\nwell, we fell into the tightest, longest squeeze! Ditto with my grad school besties, whom I\nlast hung out with on a pre-pandemic yoga retreat in the Berkshires at the end of the\nyear before last. A beautiful reunion.\nThe gorgeous spring weather is bringing New Yorkers out. Diners pack \u2018huts\u2019 taking up\nseveral parking spaces outside restaurants, and spill into the street. The Union Square\nfarmers market bustles. The number of bikes seems to equal that of cars. Most everyone\n                       689 / 1.901\nis masked (certainly indoors) but some remove their masks outdoors. Lots of empty\nstore fronts, though. And homeless. I can\u2019t imagine how desolate midtown is. The city is\nrebounding but it will take time and effort. I\u2019m a city walker. The rhythms and vibes of\nmy city resonate with me. I may need to move back sooner rather than later.\nA wonderful cousin w/whom I\u2019ve recently reconnected has lent me the fabulous floor-\nthrough loft apartment she and her husband own in Flatiron. Staying in this stylish place,\nfull of interesting books, artwork, and objects presumably collected from my cousins\u2019\ntravels, is good for me.\nSo there\u2019s been a happy family reunion lunch at a Spanish tapas restaurant, followed by\na swing by Eataly and a family hang in Madison Square Park (abuzz with sunbathers!); an\nequally joyous reunion w/my grad school friends over brunch off Washington Square\nPark, amidst our NYU haunts; pizza w/my mother and Arnold; tomorrow, a picnic in\nCentral Park w/a few college friends and dinner w/my mother and Ben\u2019s girlfriend,\nSammi; Wednesday, lunch and gab fest w/my cousin Julie, who lives in FL but who\nfortuitously this week is helping my aunt move back into her CT home; and then\nThursday, back to SC w/Ben (who\u2019s actually been hiking w/buddies in CO this week, but\nw/whom I had a quick lunch at Breads Bakery before he left for the airport). We\u2019ll catch\nup in the car. There\u2019s also been some shopping (Kiehl\u2019s, Sephora, and I\u2019ll likely hit\nKalustyan tomorrow to pick up dried fruits and nuts, hummus, baba ganoush, and\nTurkish delight for a small gathering I\u2019m hosting on Friday; also need harissa paste).\nThere\u2019s also been some admin work that I need to finish up before my headship term\nends and I\u2019m officially retired on 30 June. There\u2019s also been hanging out at my mom\u2019s\napartment, going through her heirloom jewelry, clothes, and old photos, remembering\nthe stories attached to them, as we like to do. My considerable energy and stamina have\nsurprised me; the city and time w/friends and family appear to energize me. MUST STAY\nIN THESE MOMENTS. Every day a blessing.\nMy last class of the semester was perfect. It flowed. It was a celebration of how much the\nstudents had learned (in my course on France and the Holocaust in Film and Literature)\nand the good uses to which I sense they will put their knowledge. Perhaps their satisfied\nfaces in their Zoom boxes tell the story.\nMore good stuff coming. So good, in fact, that I will choose not to look at my bloodwork\nresults until this coming weekend, after the next round of good stuff is over. Need to\nresist, for just a little while longer at least, worried projections into the future.\nFinally, as I've mentioned I believe, on 6/6 I'll be participating for the second year in a\nrow in a 1k walk/5k run to raise funds for the Kelly Gynecologic Oncology at Hopkins,\nwhere I have received cutting-edge treatment and life-sustaining care from Dr. Anna\nBeavis and indeed every medical professional I've encountered there. Should you wish to\nmake a donation to help other women receive the stellar care I've benefitted from,\n                       690 / 1.901\nplease see below:\nTo make a donation to my #willapower team (all funds go directly to KEGOS), look here: \nhttps://runsignup.com/willapower.

    "entry": "My health continues to remain stable, which is by far the most important thing right now.\nMy counts are normal. My CA 125 number (OC marker)is at 18, still well within the\nnormal range (0-38), although it's a point higher than it was last month, and a few\nmonths ago it was at 11. So is this a normal fluctuation or a very subtle and slow uptick?\nThat uncertainty translated into a bunch of sleepless hours one night. In the words of the\nnurse who calls me after each blood test to debrief: \"Right now we do not consider this a\ncause for concern.\" So I'll hold onto that until otherwise advised. Overall, I'm still feeling\nwell, remain energetic, and continue to pray that this prolonged (for me) 'honeymoon\nphase' continues.\n                       693 / 1.901\nThe excellent health report fortunately put into perspective a tech disaster that occurred\nthe morning of my retirement party last Friday, when I realized that I had returned home\nto not one but two non-functioning computers: my laptop (which had worked fine in NY)\nwas dead (battery, according to my IT people here at Penn State, is 'swollen' and needs\nto be replaced, but my files are fine) and my desktop also seemed dead as a doornail\n(message reads: \"fan failure;\" I surmise it may have overheated when I was in the city. IT\nfolks will be working on that tomorrow too). Problem was that I had not saved my\nprepared remarks for the party on a thumb drive and Ben (who came back to SC with\nme) spent hours patiently waiting for my laptop to acquire enough 'juice' for him to be\nable to send that document to his own computer. All was resolved with about twenty\nminutes to spare before the party started at 2 p.m.; I didn't even have time to shower. In\nthe end, I used Ben's laptop to participate in the party and read my remarks off his iPad\n(he then switched to his phone to watch). I honestly don't know what I would have done\nhad Ben not been there to save the day. \nIt's hard for me to describe how wonderful the party was ; instead, I will include the link\nto it below. Well over 100 people attended, representing all phases and walks of my life:\nfamily, colleagues, current and former students (some from the late 1990s), friends from\ngrade school, college, grad school, friends and colleagues from the States and France.\nQuite amazing. There were dozens of touching tributes via video and written text, many\ntransmitted during a 35 mn video/slide presentation that my colleagues and one of my\ngraduate students had skillfully and artfully put together (part of it was paired with a\ncolleague in tux and bow tie singing an impressive rendition of \"My Way\").  Colleagues\nand grad students contributed to  a bounty of gifts for me that showed they know my\ntaste/s *perfectly:* a gorgeous scarf from the MET patterned with a Delacroix bouquet,\nan equally gorgeous, vaguely Deco-ish necklace featuring triangular pieces of pink opal,\na beautiful blown glass flower, perhaps an iris, which pairs beautifully with a green Deco\nvase on my mantle and from the students: a fabulous charcuterie board that has me\nplanning future parties; Yotam Ottolenghi's _Jerusalem_ cookbook (he's my current\ncooking god/guru)  and a gorgeous leather bound and monogrammed blank recipe book\nfor me to fill with our family recipes and give to Ben (I must have mentioned that I\nintended to make that a retirement project). Inserted in the book were several favorite\nrecipes from the *students.* I was so touched by the care and thoughtfulness these\npresents represent. I could share many other impressions but I think the recording tells\nthe story best. Feel free to watch or dip in (but be forewarned that it lasts two hours!):\nhttps://psu.zoom.us/rec/play/oAPJWl83uW6ZF-v7wAI_VuxOsQhb7aLUA54wj_D4_s1j8qHiU\nPh51It-TSqa2hMh_geBfR7-tO9u0OcO._N6LJMCHmIQznONi\nhttps://psu.zoom.us/rec/play/oAPJWl83uW6ZF-v7wAI_VuxOsQhb7aLUA54wj_D4_s1j8qHiU\nPh51It-TSqa2hMh_geBfR7-tO9u0OcO._N6LJMCHmIQznONi\nI had a modest afterparty for a few colleagues  at my home following the virtual event:\nchampagne, cake, and goodies I had brought back from Kalustyan in the city (humus and\n                       694 / 1.901\nbaba ganoush, cumin spiced cashews, tapenade, samosas, olives etc.). This was the first\n'unmasked' and in person many of us had experienced in a long time and we were all\ngiddy with excitement!\nI kept thinking about this gospel song that (for some reason) my father used to like:\n\"We're blessed,\" by the Mighty Clouds of Joy: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzkNtZmv-rl  YES!\nMy stay in the city was terrific. A college classmate organized a potluck picnic (goodies\nfrom Zabar's!) for about fifteen or so of us, in an idyllic spot in Central Park overlooking\nthe rowboat lake on a glorious day. I entered the park at Strawberry Fields and a guy\nwas playing one of my favorite Lennon songs: \"Jealous Guy.\" Happy to see some friends\namong this group and to meet others whom I didn't know well in college. One classmate\neven got us to do a silly line dance that he and another friend edited into a fun/ny video\nthat was shown at another 40th reunion event  in CA:\nhttps://vimeo.com/showcase/8501729\nPassword: 81SoMuchFun!\nMy last day in NY my cousin Julie came to the city from CT, where she was helping her\nmother (ie my aunt) move back into her home after spending the winter in FL. Julie lives\nin FL too so the timing was quite fortuitous.  It was wonderful to catch up over brunch, a\nstroll around the farmer's market and a chat in Union Square Park w/my same-age\ncousin, who as she put it in the college she made for me (included in the video portion of\nmy retirement fete), is my 'friend by choice' and sister by temperament, shared\nexperience, closeness etc. (my paraphrase). It was wonderful. I dropped Julie off at my\nmother's in the late afternoon so they could spend some quality aunt-niece time.\nSo Ben and I drove back from the city to SC, me feeling high on New York, as if I needed\nto return immediately. Of course, as soon as I returned home I started to feel high on\nState College again. Saturday I took off in my car into the country, as I like to do; the\nfarmland is starting to look lush, the streams and creeks are gurgling happily, birds are\nsinging. I stopped by my new favorite antiques store and bought an Art Nouveau mirror,\nthen headed to an Amish farm to pick up rhubarb and asparagus. It's so peaceful here,\nso quiet, my condo is so comfortable and I'm surrounded by all the pretty things I've\nassembled.\nNot much planned for this holiday weekend: Saturday will visit a friend's art exhibit in\nBellefonte (county seat, pretty Victorian architecture) w/a few other friends + have\nlunch. May go to an Amish market tomorrow where I had good luck buying nice planters\nnext year. But it will be quiet.  And that's when I start jonesing for the city again. In the\nend, despite the rich trove of friendships and love engulfing me at my retirement party, I\n                       695 / 1.901\nfeel that I don't have that many close friends here, at least friends that I can contact on a\nweekend and say: \"hey, wanna take a drive for a few hours and hit an antiques store, a\ngreenhouse and a farmstand or two?\" My NY 'life' (and my Paris life) seem more\namenable to that type of spontaneous outing.\nSo I'm back to a sort of existential state: I have a whole free day ahead of me (but rest\nassured, I do have a good amount of work still to tie up before my official retirement\ndate of 6/30); how do I want to spend it? I've also been spinning travel fantasies:\nwatched a great cooking/food show called \"High on the Hog\" last night (on the roots of\nAfrican-American cooking); the first episode was set in Benin, which suddenly  gave me a\nwild desire to go to Benin -- those gorgeous patterned fabrics! the food looks really good!\nThey speak French! Those fabulous floating markets! And the dolorous history that I\nneed to know more about. Then I was concocting a trip to the West Coast to visit\neveryone I know there -- rent a car and explore the coastline. Then I was planning an\nasap trip to Paris. And a return visit to NY. But June is so pretty here in central PA: why\nnot stay here, throw out all the files I no longer need, relax, read, cook, hike, enjoy...\nFirst-world problems, for sure (yet always compounded for me by that irksome sense of\n\"time's wing'd chariot hurrying near\").\nSo I feel like I'm in a bit of free fall right now. I knew it would happen as retirement\nnears. It brings to mind a passage from Georges Perec's _W, or the Memory of\nChildhood_ that my students and I read this semester in my course on France and the\nHolocaust: \"I was plunged into nothingness; all the threads were broken; I fell, on my\nown, without any support.\" I've also been loving John Mayer's acoustic cover of Tom\nPetty's \"Free Falling:\"\nI'm gonna free fall out into nothin'\nGonna leave this world for a while\nAnd I'm free \nFree fallin' \nThe song's not about my current state, but yet it resonates. I'll leave you with it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKzoEwQaF7Y\nEnjoy.\n \n                       696 / 1.901",

    "entry": "698 / 1.901\n                       699 / 1.901\nIt's been a wondrous weekend, marked by the convergence of Stride&Thrive, the\nfundraiser for Hopkins' KGOS (Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service), for which I've been\nrallying the troops the better part of the past year, and the two events (virtual this year)\nthat form the emotional core of each of our college reunions: \"Glimpses\" and the\nMemorial Service.\nStride&Thrive took place this morning, bookended by the reunion events. Bright\nsunshine and heat; I needed to make sure to take two full water bottles before driving to\nmeet my #willapower teammates at the Pump Station Cafe in Boalsburg, across the\nstreet from the Military Museum path along which we also walked last year. I've spent\nmuch of the past few days trying to raise my fundraising total: I had set a perhaps\nunrealistic goal of $10K but was thrilled, thanks to a flurry of last minute donations, to\nreport a total of $8.168.00 from *108 donors,* up from about $7K last year (my total was\nfourth highest out of about twenty-five participating teams). And each $ will help fund\nHopkins' remarkable survivorship services: mentorship programs (which paired me with\na wonderful mentor two years ago), services for caregivers, discussion groups,\nprogramming, gift bags for survivors (that crocheted afghan came in handy during\nchemo...), an excellent web page, virtual yoga classes, classes on journaling etc. It's\npossible that some of the funds go to basic research too -- also very important -- but in\nmy experience the 'aftercare' of survivors (ie those surviving with gyn. cancers) is crucial\nas well. I had to ask Ben at some point in the last day or two if I seemed like I was\n'groveling' for $, even pestering a few of my neighbors who have helped me over the\npast few years and outright asking a few college classmates to please contribute. As I've\nsaid elsewhere on this blog, however, I will beg, borrow and steal, and grovel if need be,\nto be a crusader against cancer. \nMy team totaled twenty-two altogether: proudly wearing our #willapower t-shirts, nine of\nus, all women, walked/ran in State College, with seven of us walking a mile at the\nMilitary Museum, one walking (her dog) separately, and a ninth running a 5k early this\nmorning. Others (all wonderful former grad students, now friends) ran in a)Philly;\nb)Winston-Salem, NC; c)the Sonoran Desert in AZ and d)E. Lansing, Michigan. A college\nfriend ran in Baltimore. Sammi, visiting her sister, ran/hiked in LA. The picture Ben texted\nme of him and his *grade school buddies* - Joe, Nikhil, and Kyle (+ Nikhil's gf), now all\nliving in NY -- before (or after?) their 5K in Prospect Park and all wearing their\n#willapower shirts, made me beam. I flashed back to the time when, 5-10 years ago (?), I\nexplained to Ben the importance of his playing in a golf tournament to raise funds for\n(ironically) another ovarian cancer charity, from which the mother of one of his friends\nwas suffering (she eventually succumbed). So Ben is all in now, and that makes me one\nproud momma. Thank you, Ben, for the mitzvah you and your friends performed today.\nYou're good men (and Irene is a good woman!). And thanks to my awesome State\nCollege teammates, fellow 'Amazons'/warrior goddesses Maria, Mary, Jackie, Jean, Tracy,\n                       700 / 1.901\nHelen, Bettina and Carol. And to the rest of my far-flung crew. I wish you could have\njoined our State College team for our post-walk coffee, a lovely moment of friendship,\ncaring, laughter, and sisterhood.\np.s. We did not win the 'spirit award' as we did last year (I personally thought we had\nTONS of spirit!), but no matter. \nAs mentioned, Stride&Thrive took place the morning after \"Glimpses,\" a reunion tradition\n(which may or may not be specific to my class) during which classmates who volunteer\nahead of time briefly (5 mn.) share something important about their lives -- a challenge,\naccomplishment, pleasurable activity, experience etc. It's all very 'unplugged' and raw\n(and in that sense, very 'un-Harvard;' my jaw dropped during the very first 'Glimpse' I\nheard, several reunions ago, which began: \"Hi, I'm [name of classmate], and I'm an\nalcoholic\"). At our last reunion I shared a \"glimpse,\" in the form of a letter to my hot\nmess of a college self from my older self, weaving in the trove of letters I wrote home\nduring that time, and which my parents saved. In any event, virtual 'glimpses' (with\nabout 160 attending) may not have the same visceral punch as they do when we're\nsitting side by side in the Science Center auditorium, but many of these vignettes were\nstill affecting. I could have done without the one about why this particular classmates\nloves loons (apparently the bird watchers loved it), but was moved by a classmate's\nheartfelt account of the challenges of navigating a gender transition with her child, which\nended \"I'm so proud to be his mom.\" Others spoke about the nature of home, the awful\nexperience of being a [Black] lawyer and poll watcher during the 2016 election, teaching\nprison writing, the passion for kimonos as related to culture and identity on the part of a\nAmerican classmate who's lived in Japan for many years. Fascinating, real, gripping. One\nclassmate, the attorney for the city of Ann Arbor, MI, wove together three stories, one\ninvolving going to the store to buy face cream for his wife, also a classmate, ill with\nmetastatic breast cancer. When I sent my well wishes to her in the chat and mentioned\nthat I was facing a cancer battle too, at least three classmates reached out to me via the\nchat (and two later emailed me), offering their support and empathy. I was so touched. I\nmust say, since graduation and especially over the past fifteen years or so, this\nclassmate network has not ceased to surprise me in the best ways. We've all been\ntested. We\u2019ve all grieved, lost parents or siblings, faced death and divorce, experienced\nserious illness or have given care to someone who has. Just about every classmate I\u2019ve\nmet or re-met in the past 15-20 years \u2013 and I\u2019ve actually made some new friends among\nclassmates I didn\u2019t know in college \u2013 is totally over any pretense cultivated during\ncollege, when we were young and trying to figure out who we were and what we wanted\nfrom life. But whho are we kidding now? It\u2019s time to get real. So the empathy extended\ntoward me (and which I tried to let flow towards others) was welcome indeed.\nThe \u201cGlimpse\u201d that moved me the most, I believe, was somewhat obscure, based on the\nimagery of broken pottery (the classmate has recently taken up ceramics) as a metaphor\nfor his painful estrangement from his daughter. Life and death were woven through his\n                       701 / 1.901\nstory too: \u201cDeath is present in the midst of life.\u201d Although told in the form of an allegory,\nhis story affected me greatly and I could sense his pain.\nAfter Stride&Thrive, I crashed on the couch for a while, then zoomed into the memorial\nservice for classmates who have died since graduation. The list, of course, gets longer\nevery reunion. Five years ago we were in Memorial Church on the Harvard campus for\nthe service and I remarked to a classmate: \u201cOne day, none of us will be here.\u201d Today I\nsat there watching on my computer screen, and wondered: \u201cIn five years, will I be here?\u201d\nStatistically, I know that the odds are about 50/50, maybe better than 50% b/c I receive\nstellar care at Hopkins. So I felt myself sinking down in my chair, dabbing at my eyes\nwhile weighed down by that thought and by certain memories of Harvard friends and\nlovers who have passed on. But other forces kept me in equipoise: the previous day\u2019s\nsense of bonding with other survivor classmates, the beautiful poetry, singing, and\ndirges played on a violin that several classmates contributed, the insights brought by\ntwo classmates who are spiritual leaders (one a rabbi, one an ecumenical minister\n[United Religions Initiative]). Their words were calming, healing, bringing a metaphysical\nperspective to my worries and really tying together all the strands of this great weekend.\n\u201cTime and space are not the measure of all things.\u201d \u201c\u2026life that knows no death.\u201d \u201c..love\neverlasting.\u201d \u201cthe wondrous quality of each breath we take.\u201d\nWhat will my legacy be? And yours?\nOr to quote Mary Oliver (as a classmate did):\n\u201cDoesn't everything die at last, and too soon?\nTell me, what is it you plan to do\nwith your one wild and precious life?\u201d\nPhotos\n                       702 / 1.901\n                       703 / 1.901",

    "entry": "An entire month has elapsed since my last blood test (and I wrote my last CB entry about\nthat time as well). Since then, I've officially retired from Penn State, hosted my mother\nfor a fun week-long visit, drove to NY w/her and spent a few days there, which included\ndinner w/Ben and Sammi at a yummy Israeli restaurant in Park Slope (Muriam) preceded\nby cocktails (a mocktail for me) with my grad school friend Shanny at a cool cocktail bar\ncalled Blueprint (also in Park Slope); lunch with another close grad school friend, Harriet;\nand some essential spice/condiment shopping at Kalustyan (several varieties of salt,\npeppercorns, za'atar, a few \"I can't resist\" pieces of halvah and Turkish delight).\nToday's blood counts aren't revealing much. The hemoglobin and liver count numbers\nare high, but that's par for the course, and they are not substantially higher than they've\nbeen (a few have even come down a bit). But obviously too much stress on my liver and\nred blood cells is not good. The CA125 number will be the big test (I'll see Dr. Patel\ntomorrow morning), and I've been feeling very anxious for the past few days for several\nreasons: a)I've had some discomfort on my right side for a few weeks. No sharp pain, but\ndiscomfort at bottom of rib cage (liver??), compounded with mild nausea (I do stress\nmild) and maybe (??) some lower back discomfort (something? nothing? result of two\nfive-hour drives to/from NY + two nights bad sleep? stress? cancer in my back and/or\nkidneys?). On the 'plus' side, I should mention that my appetite is normal, ditto for my\nenergy level, and I don't look visibly 'ill' but I've come to understand that serious illness\nis not always signaled visually; b) I intuit that I may be 'due' for a recurrence, as Dr.\nBeavis told me they usually occur at regular intervals (my first occurred after six months\nand it's been about another six months since I finished chemo to deal with that first\nrecurrence; on the other hand, there were 'complicating factors' during the period of the\nfirst recurrence due to my fistula surgery, drainage procedures etc.). Hopefully I'll know\nmore tomorrow. Admittedly, I'm having trouble staying calm, imagining the worst\n('defensive pessimism,' my therapist calls it).\nWhat lifted me up today was a *wonderful* zoom convo with Brenda, a college classmate\nwhom I did not know in college. Rather, I found out via another classmate (another\nBrenda!) that this Brenda, who lives in Chicago, is also combatting advanced OC, since\n2017 it turns out. She's been through several runs of chemo, radiation, debulking\nsurgery, and more, but seemed upbeat (is very much about the 'being in the now') and\nlooked quite glam to me (we share a passion for jewelry, which she likes to buy at\nauction). She gave me her rationale for making long(er) range plans, which I've been\nresisting b/c of all the uncertainty generated by my condition. Consequently, she's been\n                       705 / 1.901\ntraveling up a storm, w/trips to Paris, Hawaii, a cruise in the Mediterranean etc. She\nsimply plans for contingencies, buying trip insurance, renting a hotel room to rest in if\nshe doesn't feel well when touring etc. Her encouragement to celebrate my half-bday in\nSeptember or October by planning a trip to Paris (which I've been thinking about\nanyway) has had me scrolling through vbro and Airbnb listings since I got off zoom with\nher! I look forward to keeping in touch with her and wish her wellness and peace of mind\n(which she appears to have in abundance, in parallel w/a strong faith). Talking to her was\nso helpful. I look forward to lunch with two of the \"III Cs\" next week, another source of\nsupport.\nThe title of this entry was the last line of a dream I had a few weeks ago, related to my\nretirement. I will try to relay the dream in another entry, but it's time for dinner so more\nsoon.\nFor anyone who might not have seen this, Penn State News published a nice story about\nme on my retirement:\nhttps://news.psu.edu/story/661863/2021/06/18/academics/french-and-francophone-\nstudies-head-retires-after-33-years-penn\nA feel-good moment for sure. :)",

    "entry": "My CA 125 number is 31.1 this month, up from 18 last month, a significant jump after six\nmonths of stability on Zejula marked by just a gradual upward creep (the graphed results\nshow this starkly). While you will read online that 'normal' range for CA 125 is up to 35,\n38, even 46, *my* normal is in the 11-13 range (at the time of my first, debulking\nsurgery my CA 125 level was over 200). I wasn't entirely surprised by this morning's\nresult as I have been having concerning symptoms for several weeks, as I reported\nyesterday: discomfort on my right side; mild nausea; now a little bit of a 'tugging' feeling\nin my lower abdomen and achy lower back, some weight gain. So when I opened the\nGeisinger portal this morning and saw the result (after talking myself down to a rational\nstate), I simply said: \"Yep.\" Then my thoughts and emotions started spinning out of\ncontrol again: fear, panic, sadness. \"Hmm - cancer is trying to make quick work of me.\" I\ndrove to my three-month checkup with Dr. Patel in a bit of a daze, after sending Dr.\nBeavis the results.\nI felt much better after speaking with him. He and Dr. Beavis concur that I need to be\nscanned, and this will happen a week from tomorrow (I'm going to see if I can move it\nup, but I presume I may not be able to). Dr. Patel examined me and felt no lumps or\nmasses. My lungs sound clear. He determined that there is no blockage b/c although I\nhave some mild nausea I am not vomiting, am moving my bowels etc. (sorry to be so\ngraphic!). A blockage would not be good. He also feels my blood counts and liver marker\nnumbers are all fine, very important for what may lie ahead. Beyond that, Dr. Patel\ndoesn't linger on hypotheticals; he wants to scan first, then make a determination about\nnext steps if they are to materialize. As always, he's very focused on my 'living my best\nlife' in the present, encouraged me strongly to attend my friend Maria's wedding in NH\nlater this month, make other longer-range plans for the 1-3 months ahead etc. (he\ndoesn't want to discourage even *longer-range* plans, but prefers I not get too far ahead\nof myself right now!). He also told me he would never venture to pronounce definitively\non prognosis, as in \"you have two years\" etc., which is what the college friend I zoomed\n                       707 / 1.901\nwith yesterday was told. Each case is different. Dr. Patel was kind and matter of fact,\nasked about Ben and my mother, gave me a hug (which I initiated), held my hand when I\nstarted crying etc. (in a completely professional way).\nWhen I worried that I had again moved too belatedly on this after several weeks of\nsymptoms, Dr. Patel reminded me that deciding when to treat (cancer) is something of\nan art; if you intervene too early, you may quickly exhaust treatment options.\nIt also appears that a pattern *may* (and I stress 'may') be emerging, my pattern: six\nmonths of 'honeymoon' (as I've experienced this Jan-June), followed by a treatment\ncycle. If it turns out that cancer is the issue here -- and if I were a betting woman I'd put\nmy money on that -- this will be the second iteration of that pattern. Dr. Beavis told me\nOC can work that way, but it doesn't always.\nAlso wanted to add (sorry for the choppiness but I'm a bit scattered today), that\n'recurrence' may be something of a misnomer as my cancer never fully disappeared,\ndespite Dr. Beavis' valiant efforts to remove all the visible cancer during my debulking\nsurgery. Some always lingered, new cancer cells emerged that are not daunted by\nZejula, that may be what's happening now and if so, another line of treatment may be\nneeded. I *hate* the thought of having my body host these nasty uninvited guests. Wish\nI could kick 'em to the curb... or worse.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Beavis had emailed me very quickly, also saying \"we need to scan.\" \"This\nmay be nothing\" she wrote,\"but the symptoms are concerning.\" She offered to place the\norder for the scan but Dr. Patel had already done so. She's on it. I will send her the\nresults so she can consult with Dr. Patel.\nDr. Patel prescribed a low dose of oxycodone if I'm feeling uncomfortable. I haven't slept\nwell the past three nights and the discomfort on my right side actually does hinder my\ngetting into a comfortable position. I'm yearning for a restful, peaceful sleep.\nAfter seeing Dr. Patel, I had my chemo port flushed as I do every six weeks. The nurses\nare extremely kind, and I stopped to chat with one in particular whom I like a lot. I must\nsay that the staff in Dr. Patel's office is kindly. No harm in being called \"darling\" by the\nreceptionist or \"Miss Willa\" by the intake nurse! The chemo nurses themselves have a\nmuch more extensive skill set, of course, which is reassuring.\nI was glad my friend Helen and I had arranged to meet at my office to pack up boxes of\nmy books both because she's a wonderful, empathic, caring friend and I love to spend\ntime her and because focusing on a rather mundane activity helped take my mind off the\nother stuff. Although I need to refrain from heavy lifting at this point, we still made a lot\nof progress. \n                       708 / 1.901\nI feel pretty drained right now so will try to relax this evening. Then I suppose I have a\nmini-reprieve until my scan next Friday. I am glad to have two lunches planned for next\nweek, one, coincidentally, with at least two of my 'teal sisters' or \"III Cs,\" as we call\nourselves, local OC survivors, the other with my friend Kathryn. I'd be happy to 'fill up my\ndance card' a bit more next week to discourage me from fixating on worst case\nscenarios, so if any State College friends reading this would be free for lunch, coffee, a\nwalk, a drive etc. next week I would welcome that!\nWhat else do I need or not need right now? Not need: pity; questions in hushed voices\nabout my prognosis; conspicuous avoidance of my medical condition; conspicuous\navoidance of me. Need: contact and communication (quick notes, emails, texts, hugs\nwelcome - if you can); prayers; laughs; being treated normally; empathy combined with\na matter of fact attitude, veering not towards pollyanna-ish optimism nor towards\ndoomsday scenarios (however, if you must choose I prob. prefer option #1 over option\n#2). Feel free to ask questions. And please let me know what I can do for *you* in my\nnot entirely 100% but still semi-vibrant state: some homemade pesto? A ride\nsomewhere? A pep talk?",

    "entry": "Back home, thankfully. Was discharged at about 4 p.m. Ben was with me and Sammi was\nwaiting in the car. I just took a hot shower as I felt really grimy (no shower in my room\nand toilet in the corner...). Ben plugged in my laptop and brought me sparkling water\nwith ginger to drink as I lie on my bed, typing. The kids are watching the Euro soccer\nfinal in the sun room.\nI woke up Friday morning vomiting bile, which I don't think I've ever done. Bile tastes\nvile. I could not identify the cause. I wrote both my oncologists to ask if/when they\nthought I should go to the ER. Neither responded for quite a while, which is unusual.\nFinally, Dr. Patel wrote that if my symptoms worsened I should go to the ER. When I was\nalready in the ER, having decided I need to get myself checked out there, Dr. Beavis'\nnurse called me to say that Dr. B. wanted me to go to the ER ASAP (she had been in a\nmeeting all day but they were able to get a message to her, to which she responded). I\nalso called my brother because he gives very good advice and is very rational, and he\nalso counseled me to err on the side of caution. So I asked my kind neighbor Janis to\ndrive me, which she was happy to do, in addition to praying over me once we got to the\nhospital. I wasn't feeling great, nothing ultra-specific, just not great.\nOnce in an ER bay, it was quickly determined to do a CT scan. As is, I was/am already\nscheduled for a CT scan this Wednesday, as warranted by the significant rise in my CA\n125 number this past week. But as it turned out this was expedited. In the meanwhile, a\nnurse or two were doing various things, I don't remember what -- taking blood, certainly.\nWhen the ER dr. came (back) in, after I had the CT scan, he sighed and said \"there's a lot\ngoing on here\" (I had updated him that I was in treatment for OC, to which he said \"I'm\nsorry.\"). The immediate problem/lower hanging fruit was an impaction of stool causing\nconstipation, which actually came as a surprise to me. That also explains why I was\nvomiting bile (I think), as 'things' were forced to come up rather than go down and out.\nSo during my hospital stay that got worked out, thankfully. As a result of all the bile I\nvomited (and there was a lot), my electrolytes went out of whack, especially my\npotassium, which can have damaging effects on the heart etc. So that also got worked\nout with big infusions of potassium and potassium pills, which I'll continue to take.\nThe more concerning news of course involves apparently new mets (metastases) of my\nOC onto my lower lung (three nodules on one lung and then this fluid issue on the right),\nperitoneum, and a lymph node on my belly, plus some tumors. At least this is how the\ndoctor described it to me. The radiologist, I think, did not compare this CT to the\nprevious one but to an earlier one, so it's not exactly clear to me what has progressed.\nBut I surmise there's been progression, perhaps significant. N.b. that my OC has been\nmetastatic since the very beginning. The hospital dr. (once I was admitted) messaged\nDr. Patel to let him know what was going on. Dr. Patel messaged that he wasn't surprised\nat the finding given my elevated CA 125 number, and that he would consult w/Dr. Beavis\n                       716 / 1.901\ntomorrow. It wasn't really until then that I though to myself: \"Duh. Of course, we've been\nwaiting for a recurrence all along.\" OC is a recurrent cancer, and I've already had one.\nIt's rather the extent of the recurrence, as far as I can tell, that scares me. The hospital\ndr. reassured me somewhat by reminding me of all the tremendous advances made in\ncancer treatment in recent years.\nI was admitted for observation and that didn't go too smoothly. The first nurse\nimmediately asked me, \"Where's your husband?\" I felt my second nurse was treating me\nlike a sack of potatoes rather than a person, and had to beg her to show compassion\ngiven the news I had just received. She sort of barked at me: \"I understand, I had\nleukemia and survived it. Then I knew that God had a plan for me.\" (aside: I too believe I\nhave a purpose to fulfill in life, which I may or may not live to fill out -- just sayin'). That\nnurse eventually softened and we wound up on ok terms. My hunch is that the staff is\nreally burned out post-COVID. Many patients died. A new hospital administration\nreplaced a large portion of the staff. So the vibe at MNMC is not the best...unfortunately.\nMy mind was racing and all the stages of grief were crashing down on me simultaneously\n-- intense fear, intense sadness, anger, frustration, gratitude (no acceptance yet). My\nmental circuits were completely overcharged in this alien environment. Sobbing.\nCareening wildly between my past and my future. Big-time FOMO. Trying to imagine\nwhat the docs will say tomorrow (surgery? chemo? radiation? we can't do anything for\nyou?). A psych liaison and then a psychiatrist came down and simply listened to me and\nvalidated all my feelings. That helped. II took some Ativan. The cloud lifted a bit more\nwhen I made touch with family and a few key friends to let them know what was going\non. Yesterday morning my angels Ben and Sammi rushed to grab the 10:30 Megabus\nfrom the city and were here by 4:00. Being able to hug them significantly lifted my\nmood.\nWhile I didn't sleep great the first night (not easy when being wakened every few hours\nto have vitals taken and with staff yakking in the hallway), the second night I actually\nslept pretty well, from 8:30 to 6:30. The jovial male night nurse who complimented my\nhamsa bracelet and told me not to snore too loudly made me giggle.  Oddly enough, my\nmind made space for some pleasant images: large flat shifting planes of sea green and\nblue, almost like an abstract ocean seen from above. Calming. Also nice images of the\nmen I've loved (truly loved), with lots of long-ago details (like the dress I wore on our first\ndate) and some of the background theme music that I forever associate with each one\n(such as Joan Armatrading's \"Love and Affection\" for one who has passed on...). It was\nvery pleasant, romantic! Such a reprieve, such beauty in the midst of my despair.\nSpeaking of despair, I was also holding on to the title of this blog, \"On the Narrow\nBridge,\" which cautions, per Rabbi Nachman of Breslow, that although the entire world is\na narrow bridge, the most important thing is not to give in to despair. And speaking of\nNachman of Breslow, my rabbi called me in the hospital, which lifted me too; we'll be in\ntouch again soon. Michael also came to visit briefly. I am so thankful for our solid\n                       717 / 1.901\nfriendship which has made it so much easier for the whole family, and Ben especially, to\nweather this storm.\nI'm in a calmer place now, but feel rather drained. I feel badly that Ben and Sammi have\nto tend to me; I'd much rather be taking them out to dinner in Brooklyn, as I did about\ntwo weeks ago. They're a great team.\nTomorrow's a new day, hopefully with a new plan. I know that Dr. Beavis is a dragon-\nslayer, and hopefully I'll be ready too.\nI can't thank you enough, each of you, for your kind words, offers of help, genuine\nexpressions of your feelings, outpourings of love, even some welcome sauciness. I have\ncried copious tears of gratitude the past few days. I may not be able to answer individual\nmails immediately, but I'll try to keep everyone updated. Much love.",

    "entry": "No word from my oncologists today. Dr. Patel is out of the office. And so I wait.\nFrustrating.\nI feel rather slothful. I don't have much pep. My side is sore. I did manage to write a\nletter of recommendation. And I received in the mail two copies of the French history\nmagazine, _Historia,_ in which a short article of mine appears. So the day isn't a total\nwash. My compulsion to be productive.\nSammi and Ben are giving me the immense gift of a calming, normalizing environment.\nRight now they are cooking shakshuka and heating up my tomato soup. They take stock\nof what I need around the house and will order it for me (eg a new can opener, a wooden\ncutting board as I only have a glass one right now, perhaps a bagel guillotine). Sammi\npicked up a cappuccino for me. I had enough energy to cook beets and Ben and I\ncollaborated on a beet, mozza and basil salad, with basil I grew (I think it's my first ever\nsuccess w/beautiful robust basil, two varieties). My mind is on cooking, which is a good\nsign. I am itching to watch either \"Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles\" or \"Summer of\n                       721 / 1.901\nSoul\" tonight. It's been storming on and off today but now the sun is out. I feel so much\ncalmer than during my hospital stay.\nI did sleep well although I still feel tired today. I had an epic dream, or a dream that was\nan epic. I was out for a night of clubbing, solo, in some dark, lively underground club(s?).\nLooking good, wearing stiletto heels and a dress with a tight bodice, cinched at waist, full\nflouncy skirt [note: in the hospital I was texting pictures from our thirtieth reunion to a\nfriend/classmate; I was wearing a killer black dress for the Saturday night party, which\nwas fantastic fun]. Don't remember too much about what I was actually doing in the\nclub, but there was a subplot about two young women who looked up to me/wanted my\napproval. One was my niece, Maya (niece on Michael's side), who strangely in the dream\nwas named 'Clotilde,' the other was a young woman (both 20-somethings) who was\nstrolling with her boyfriend but was showing off her brown suede boots to me to garner\nmy approval.\nThe significant part of the dream is that I lost my black purse, which I had taken with me\nto the club. I had put it on a ledge so as not to be encumbered by it. The purse had\n*everything* in it: cell phone (communication, contact, mobility), cash (freedom,\npossibilities, survival?), id card (identity), more. If the purse was lost I risked losing all\nthose things, as I suppose I do during this latest health setback. Btw, I don't believe the\npurse was stolen, but maybe it was. There was just so much commotion in the club and\nso many black purses that mine simply went astray.\nInitially, I accepted that the purse was lost. Then the self-question became: \"How much\neffort are you willing to make to get all of this back?\" I decided that I couldn't give up so\neasily. So I walked through the club to a lost and found (?), where I saw several black\npurses similar to mine as well as several handbag straps that looked familiar. But none\nof the bags were mine. At a certain point, I simply gave up on trying to reclaim the purse\nand its contents. So I left the club empty-handed, also aware that it was 1 a.m. and that\nsomeone, I don't know who, needed to be alerted to that fact or was waiting for me as I\nwas out late.\nThe strange end to the dream: exiting this netherworld of clubland at 1 a.m., I was\nblinded by bright sunshine, as if it were a sunny summer morning. People were walking\nthe streets, the city was abuzz. I was stupified. Since I no longer had my purse, I debated\nwalking to my destination but was constrained by my stiletto heels and also by the\nthought that it might be dangerous if it were really 1 a.m. and I was somehow being\nlured into thinking it was daytime. Day for night in this topsy-turvy, Alice through the\nLooking-Glass World. Curiouser and curiouser...\nMy therapist pointed out today that in my real life an army of supporters would likely\nhave been helping me find my black purse and its contents, essential in some sense to\nmy survival. Please help me find my black purse!\n                       722 / 1.901",

    "entry": "724 / 1.901\n                       725 / 1.901\nAs of right now (6:35 Tuesday), I haven't spoken directly with either Dr. Beavis or Dr.\nPatel, but the emails were flying fast and furious with the nurses this morning. This is\nwhat I know so far: 1) Dr. Beavis is going to discuss my case with the 'tumor board' in\nher service, where she can receive the most expert advice about what may be the best\ntreatment plan for me (this is why I go to Hopkins...). 2) One possibility, all things being\nequal (eg if I'm eligible, location etc.), is for me to enter a clinical trial. My longtime\nimpression that a clinical trial is a wacky last-ditch effort has since been proved totally\nerroneous. Clinical trials are based on the most cutting edge research and always have\nto meet the standard of care of more standard treatments. They can be quite promising,\nbut there is less data about their success rate. 3)More chemo with a new (for me) drug\ncombo is also a possibility. \nThat's pretty much all I know. I don't know if there are other options other than clinical\ntrial/chemo. My hunch is that nothing will happen before next week, but after that it's a\nseries of question marks. Ben and Sammi are still here (bless them), but may be leaving\non Thursday. I have no idea what my needs may be going forward; it will depend on the\ntreatment plan.\nI'm feeling calmer, despite the potential seriousness of the setback (which was not\nunexpected with OC). The hospital stay was awful; aside from the trauma of learning of\nmy recurrence, I really think our local hospital has worsened a few notches since COVID,\na major change of staff, and the arrival of new hospital administrators. I went to the\nfarmers market today and may do some cooking, but carrying the heavy bag from the\nmarket tugged on my abdomen, so I must avoid that. I am so happy to be at home, at\nmy kitchen table brightened by a vase of sunflowers the kids placed there. Was able to\ndo some work today, including making good headway on providing (overdue...) feedback\non a dissertation chapter by one of our grad students -- a very interesting read.\nI am certain that the 'dragon-slayer' and her team will come up with the best possible\ntreatment plan for me.\nMore updates as I have them.

    "entry": "727 / 1.901\n                       728 / 1.901\nJust as I pushed the 'publish' button on yesterday's entry, Dr. Beavis called me. V. glad I\npublished right before a crazy storm hit, killing our electricity and internet for four hours\nand leaving the three of us to sit in the dark playing \"20 Questions\" by candlelight, while\nthe sky outside hissed and crackled with electric current and the sky turned shades of\napocalyptic red and dark gray. The power returned about 12:40 but today -- wait for it --\nthe air conditioning is out (until it can hopefully be repaired on Friday). Nothing like\nsweltering in an 80 degree house. Oy vey. When it rains... (and boy, did it ever).\nIn between pressing 'push' and the onset of the Apocalypse, I spoke with Dr. Beavis for\nabout 30-45 minutes. As ever, the Dragonslayer was upbeat, thorough, patient,\nsupremely knowledgeable. She thinks highly of Dr. Patel and the two of them apparently\nwork very well together. Here is what I know: a) Surgery is not a good option for me and\ncould actually hurt me as it works best if it's been at least a year since last recurrence\n(for me, it's been over seven months, which fortunately puts me over the fateful six-\nmonth mark under which treatment becomes significantly dicier). Hearing that my future\nportends no surgery was a relief; b)Radiation would not be helpful; c)she will consult\nw/the Hopkins (gyn) tumor board on Friday to see if her colleagues can suggest plans\nthat make more sense than her own; d)it's unlikely I'll be eligible for a clinical trial right\nnow (I think it might have to do with my BRCA negative status), but she was checking\none final piece of information to confirm; she gave me the link enabling me to read\nabout all the clinical trials currently being conducted around the country, in case a new\nstudy emerges for which I might be eligible (at Sloan, for example) down the road; e) it is\nlikely, although not definite, that I will receive a new course of chemo combining\ncarboplatin (which I've had before) and gemzar (which I haven't). f)A PET scan is not\nwarranted at this time; Dr. Beavis would only pursue if there was any suspicion of cancer\nhaving metastasized to my brain (if I had persistent headaches and nausea, which I do\nnot). However, today Dr. Patel ordered a CT of my lungs for Monday to see if there any\nfindings that need evaluation. So I suppose that my treatment plan will be finalized next\nweek sometime. In the meantime, I'm 'detoxing' from the parp inhibitor (daily chemo pill\nthat I did quite well on for seven + months), clearing my system for the next series of\ndrugs.\nIf more chemo is in my future, Dr. Beavis said I would experience hair thinning but I've\njust read that this combo makes you in fact  lose all your hair, which in the scheme of\nthings is not my ultimate concern, by any means. She explained two different timetables\nfor receiving this chemo, but I need to know more. The spread of my cancer around my\nabdomen and pelvis is not uncommon. The nodules on my lungs are tiny; the amount of\nfluid on my right side is tiny; she doesn't understand why I have discomfort there but\nprescribed megadoses of ibuprofen and Tylenol. She is performing another test on my\ntumor (a piece of which was saved during debulking!) to gather further information\nabout possible genetic mutations.\n                       729 / 1.901\nI was also very happy to hear Dr. Beavis mention two other chemo regimens that she is\nkeeping \"in her back pocket\" for future recurrences. She and Dr. Patel are being very\nmindful of the sequencing and types of treatments for  this chronic recurring condition.\nAfter speaking with Dr. Beavis and then enduring four hours of a power outage, I found it\nreally tough to sleep -- but not in a bad way. I felt so reassured after speaking with this\nwonderful doctor. I was simply feeling intensely carpe diem-ish, and even contemplated\ngetting out of bed and laying into my to-do list. Sometime around 2 a.m. \"time's winged\nchariot,\" per Marvell, was hurrying at my back, but the mantra speaking to me even\nmore loudly came from a book I used to enjoy reading Ben: Dr. Seuss' _Marvin K.\nMooney, will you please go now!:\" \"Please go, go, GO! Please do, do, DO!\" So I am back\nto going and doing. Around 3 a.m. I was mentally recording in the wonderful blank recipe\nbook I received as a retirement gift the chicken soup recipe I have perfected over the\nyears, w/dozens of little hints and tips that I want to pass on to Ben when I eventually\n'bequeath' him the book. Around 4 a.m. I was hoping I could get to my friend's wedding\nnext weekend and planning how to accessorize the dress I ordered to wear to it from my\nfavorite store in Paris (still sitting in the post office; hope it fits).\nDespite the insomnia I was actually in a very happy place mentally and emotionally,\nfeeling that my doctors had snatched me back from the depths and set me back on the\npractical path of treating my disease. So while ovarian cancer is undoubtedly an awful\ndisease, you should not imagine that I'm anywhere near 'the end' - at all. That was\ntotally the message from Dr. Beavis as well -- who knows that I don't want to hear about\n'timelines' or anything like that until we've reached the end of effective treatments, at\nwhich point she'll be candid with me. But I reiterate that this is nowhere in my near\nfuture, should you be imagining the contrary.\nCancer is so strange.\nThings that made me happy/grateful today:\n>Receiving a gorgeous bouquet from a very dear, special and beloved 'ame soeur'\n[=soul sister] (circumflex accent over the 'a' plus the Latin alphabet grapheme oe>don't\nhave the right keyboard with me!), whom I will thank personally v. soon. The gorgeous\nsunflowers, pink roses and lilies are glorious to behold and have been in my view most of\nthe day as I work at the kitchen table.\n>Lunch with two of my 'teal sisters' or \"III Cs,\" as we call our group of OC survivors who\nmeet up once in a while to trade news and updates. One of them, Deb, is a twelve-year\nsurvivor who has had *seven* recurrences, and who knows a thing or two about making\nplans (>ie you make them), living in the moment, resilience, and OC as a chronic,\ntreatable condition like diabetes or Chron's disease.\n>Ok, to be crassly materialistic: makeup shopping at ULTA. Clinique concealer, Urban\n                       730 / 1.901\nDecay shimmery gold eyeshadow (\"Dumb Luck\") and blue eye pencil (\"Chaos\"). I loved\nthe young salesperson, who looked to be about eighteen, sporting a glittery palette of\neye shadow that would have given Bowie a run for his money. In fact, I really hope this\nfellow has discovered Bowie. Instead of coordinating my dress with makeup in the same\npalette, he encouraged me to 'go bold or go home,' with contrasting and/or unexpected\ncolors. So the peach tones of the dress may keep company with blue eye pencil (a color I\nrarely wear). We'll see how this experiment pans out.\nabout to do some cooking now: pesto, peach cobbler. Ben and Sammi leaving tomorrow\nfor the weekend but several close friends are around.\nHappy Bastille Day!

    "entry": "Updates: 1) Had chest CT today to make sure all the critical areas are covered. Was told\nthe radiologists here would likely not read the scans for a week (!); I hope Dr. Beavis'\nteam can read them more quickly; 2)Will be starting a new course of chemo -- every\nother week -- next Wednesday with one drug I've had before (carboplatin) and one I\nhaven't (gemcitabine). Dr. Beavis consulted with her 'tumor board' and the consensus\nwas that this would be the best course for me and also the next logical step in the\nsequence of treatments usually given to OC patients who are not platinum resistant. I\nhave purposely avoided looking for info on this combo and possible side effects for fear\nI'll be upset by what I read (feel free to Google away, should you wish); I'll wait until next\nTuesday when I speak with Dr. Patel. He'll review the results of the chest CT with me\n                       734 / 1.901\n(hopefully there will be no significant findings, he is simply doing 'due diligence') and talk\nto me about the upcoming treatment. My support network here is solid -- one friend has\nalready tentatively offered to take me/pick me up/visit with me/bring me a milkshake\nduring chemo should I wish; another has let me know she can activate the Meal Train if\nneeded; a third, again so kindly, said she and her husband could finish packing up my\noffice on campus if needed so that the new head can settle in; a fourth sent me a\ngorgeous necklace that she was given when she started her own OC journey in 2015; it's\nsilver, and bears the cancer ribbon plus the Hebrew inscription \"Chazak ve'ematz\" [\"be\nstrong and of good courage\"]. I am so touched by this gesture, Rhonda, and will be\nthanking you very soon! I love this idea of 'teal sisters' providing \"strength from a\ncommunal place of caring,\" per the lovely card accompanying the necklace; a fifth\nfriend, in Boston, sent a kind note to let me know I was in her thoughts. I am so\nincredibly buoyed by all these gestures of love, caring and support.\nI have no idea how the new drugs will affect me, but I'll soon find out. I simply hope that\nthey are not too debilitating. I'll be ready.\n \nMeanwhile, lifted up by my new 'teal sister' (and college classmate) Brenda's mantra of\n\"first the scans, then the plans,\" I am heading this Thursday to N. Conway, NH, to the\nwedding of a close friend  here. Five of us will make the drive together, in a minivan\nrented for the occasion, including two PSU friends (a couple, one of whom is a\nphysician!), the bride's mother and one of the bride's sons, who coincidentally took two\nclasses with me. I'll have a free day to lounge by the pool, take a walk in town,  etc.\nbefore the wedding on Saturday. I have a killer dress, ordered from Paris (but a bit too\ntight; hope I can squeeze myself into it) and found some pretty hair clips in poppy and\ncoral organza that match some of the shades in the dress, described by  friend as\n\"Gauguinesque.\" Probably some fairly understated pearl earrings and bracelet plus gold\nsandals.\nAnd in \"first the scans, then the plans\" Part II, I booked a week at a beach front hotel in\nAmagansett in mid-August for myself, Ben, and hopefully Sammi for a long weekend.\nWe'll have a small kitchen in which to cook up produce and seafood from the farmers\nmarket. It is not lost on me that -- and not to gloat, but... -- while my colleagues are\npreparing syllabi I'll be on the beach w/a good novel, toes in the ocean after savoring a\nlobster roll for lunch. I look forward to a chill, fun week. I just hope the new chemo\ncocktail doesn't knock me out.\nOther happy moments of the past/next few days: a)Sunday morning coffee w/my friend\nHelen on the shady porch of Caf\u00e9 Lemont -- so relaxing and so much fun to hang out; b)a\nvisit from my friend and soon to be bride Maria; c)a lovely walk/talk this morning at the\nMilitary Museum with my friend Jackie (another \"IIIC\" who understands *exactly* what I\n                       735 / 1.901\nam going through and views it as I do as an anticipated setback, which will be\novercome); d)Ben's return from MA, which inspired some culinary creativity on my part\n(zucchini stuffed w/ground beef, rice, pine nuts, parsley, craisins, nutmeg and allspice;\nbaked peaches with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche); e)tomorrow's visit from my dear friend from grad\nschool, Isabelle, and her equally dear husband, Rob. Rob's family has a home in PA so Isa\nand Rob will drive down from there for dinner, stay over, and then depart on Wednesday.\nGiggling is guaranteed!; f)a number of other texts, emails, FB messages and not so\nrandom acts of kindness; g)four essays I am reading by Oliver Sacks, whose writing I\nlove, grouped together under the title _Gratitude._ He wrote them in the final months of\nhis life. Poignant and clear-sighted.\nI'm a lucky woman.\nP.S. A few people have mentioned to me that they no longer receive notifications from\nCB when I have posted. I apologize for this and unfortunately cannot proffer an\nexplanation. Perhaps check w/CB? Reregister on the site?\nP.P.S. A number of people have complimented me on my blog, its writing etc. (merci).\nW/out going into too much detail here, my creative energy right now is strongly tending\ntowards trying to create a performance piece from it (currently 200 entries and going\nstrong - \"an incredible archive,\" per Ben), which would incorporate music (I have a local\nmusician in mind to sing the title song -- \"The Narrow Bridge\" -- as well as a few other\npieces such as Debbie Friedman's \"Mi Shebeirach\"). I was a theatre person in college but\ndo not have directorial experience. I am wondering whether I could sustain interest if this\nwere a one-woman show (ie is my story that compelling?) or whether I should try to\ninclude other survivors (of whom I know many). But I also have to think about my\nwherewithal in terms of energy, which would argue for a more modest scope. I see this\nas a community-based project (to take place at Webster's bookstore? Elsewhere?) and as\na fundraiser for cancer causes and/or Caring Bridge. Its raison d'\u00eatre? Awareness,\nvisibility, connection around issues of mortality, pain, care, gratitude, friendship and\nother recurring themes in my blog. I welcome any and all ideas (seriously), including\ndismissal of my concept as balderdash, self-indulgent drivel. Seriously.\nP.P.P.S - Title of this entry.

    "entry": "744 / 1.901\n                       745 / 1.901\nMaria and Greg got married! Under a brilliant blue July sky framed by pine trees and the\nWhite Mountains of New Hampshire, and with Stonehurst, summer residence of the\nrobber baron-ish Bigelow family, serving as a backdrop. The sunlight, crisp air, bright\ncolor palette, and classical music drifting through the ceremony all seemed especially\nvivid to me. The couple's parents and adult children beamed, the bride's younger brother\nmade a heartfelt toast, a lovely luncheon was served, there was dancing. My convivial\ntable mates included a (formerly PSU) American historian and her documentary\nfilmmaker husband, a native NY-er like myself; a former bf of the bride; and two longtime\nbuddies of the groom, who hails from New Hampshire.\nI managed to decompress from a mind-bogglingly long (10+ hour) drive to New\nHampshire (spent in the good company of Maria's mother, son [a former student of mine,\ncoincidentally] and two State College friends, one the officiant at the wedding) with a\nrelaxing day discovering the cute town of N. Conway, NH, easing into a mani-pedi, book\nbuying (_All the Light We Cannot See_), treating myself to a nice dinner at a farm to\ntable place, and being massaged by the jets in the hotel jacuzzi. Slept well all three\nnights, although one sleep punctuated by a dream pitting the Nazis v. the Resistance. I\nknew of my quasi-inevitable fate (ie death) as a Jew being tracked by the Nazis, but still\nattempted to beat it by trying to glean clues from a cabbie named \"Leon\" (?) whose\nname, I surmised, contained some sort of useful clue or code that I might need to\nescape. The story's ending remained unclear.\nI wore the killer dress and the pretty organza flowers in my hair to the wedding and\nreceived the requisite (and appreciated) oohs and aahs on Facebook when I posted a few\npics. I *did* feel well that day and imbued with a certain feminine power and confidence.\nWere these affirmations from folks who know my 'real' condition and are cheering me\non? From folks who may be misled into thinking that I'm 'all better?' Was this my 'last\nhurrah' (hope not)? No matter, it was fun to dress up and attend a party and dance; I've\nalways enjoyed that.\nMy luncheon companion to my right (one of the groom's buddies), Bob, an interesting\nguy who has lived mainly in China and traveled widely in Asia, told me that his wife\npassed away just a few months ago: colorectal cancer that metastasized to the liver and\neventually the brain: \"It was simply awful to see this brilliant, vibrant woman completely\ndisintegrate.\" Gulp. I tapped on my port and shared that I too was surviving with\nadvanced metastatic cancer and perhaps had some inkling of the shock and grief he was\nexperiencing. That was a 'narrow bridge' moment for me. It made me think of those\ngame shows I used to watch when I would be home sick from grade school, \"Let's Make a\nDeal,\" for example. Behind door 1 there's a new car, door 2 opens to reveal a new dining\nroom set, and the curtain rises on door 3 to reveal ... bupkis. Behind which door does my\nfate lie? Will it play out as it did for Bob and his wife (certainly plausible)? As it currently\n                       746 / 1.901\nis for my college classmate/'teal sister' Brenda, who's been contending with terrible\nheadaches and nausea that have led her dr. to order an MRI of her brain (plausible too)?\nAs it is for my \"III C\" pal Deb, seven recurrences and counting after twelve years?\n(plausible, I suppose)? Or as it has for my \"III C\" ladies Jackie and Helen (breast cancer\nbut no further OC recurrences)? So....much....uncertainty.\nSo tomorrow begins a new course of chemo. Cisplatin + gemzar, every two weeks, six\nhours each time (the actual drugs will only drip into me for 1.5 hours, the other 4.5 hours\nI'll be infused with other fluids). It's unclear for how long I'll receive this treatment; it will\ndepend on how it affects me. The list of possible side effects -- tinnitis/hearing loss, rash,\nnausea/vomiting, neuropathy in fingers, decrease in red and white blood cells and\nplatelets - made my eyes glaze over. I hope my body will be strong. More than anything,\nthough, I hope that the drugs will beat back the cancer. Good that Dr. Patel did 'due\ndiligence' by ordering a CT scan of my chest, because there are indeed some small\nnodules there now, along with an enlarged lymph node near my trachea (I forgot to ask\nwhether this means that tracheal cancer might be in my future).\nI woke up one day recently scared. Is cancer trying to make quick work of me? So I go\nback to the mantras: one day at a time; the important thing is not to give in to fear; be\nstrong and of good courage. Dr. Patel assured me that he'd be right there with me each\nstep of the way, and will tweak the amount of drugs I receive if need be. Obviously the\nspreading isn't good news but hopefully it can be arrested. I feel grateful to be able to be\ntreated here in Sate College where I am comfortable, and very well supported by friends\nand by my medical team (Dr. Beavis is consulting with Dr. Patel throughout). I'll have my\nblood tested and my pelvis/abdomen/chest scanned regularly. Thank you  in advance --\nall of you -- for directing healing energy my way. A doctor friend who was part of our\n'caravan' on the ride to NH confirmed for me that a 'positive attitude' can really make a\ndifference physiologically. And most of the time I can count on that (my blood pressure\nwas a bit high today but that's probably b/c I am anxious).\nA  visit from my dear friends Isabelle and Rob was a huge blessing last week!\nReminiscing about all the fun and silliness of our grad school days, catching up on\nwhatever is important in our lives (we each have one 25-30 yo son), and massive\ngiggling over both dinner on my little patio  and then breakfast the next morning at a\ncute local breakfast place felt like balm to my spirit! Grateful for these solid,\nlongstanding, rich friendships.\nWill try to report on tomorrow's chemo provided I have the fortitude to do so.\n \n \n                       747 / 1.901\nPhotos\n                       748 / 1.901\n                       749 / 1.901\n                       750 / 1.901\n                       751 / 1.901",

    "entry": "757 / 1.901\nI got through my first chemo ok yesterday. Six hours: 1.5 for the two chemo drugs (1 +\n.5); 4.5 for fluids, including electrolytes, a diuretic to make sure the meds were working\nthemselves through my kidneys (and which had me going to the bathroom every ten\nminutes, tethered to my infusion pole); a bit of time for 'miscellany' (eg flushing out my\nport, accessing/deaccessing). I am in a new chemo room that opened in January, so\nmuch more comfortable and pleasant than the dingy one I started off in. This one is\nlarger, outfitted with windows (!!), ample bays for each patient, etc. The nurses are\nwonderful, and I was lucky to have assigned to me yesterday my favorite, Tracey, a\ndivorced mom of two sons a bit younger than me who is skillful, and compassionate. I\nenjoy chatting with her. No raging Trumpers in the chemo room (an unpleasant memory\nfrom my pre-election course of chemo) but an equally obtrusive man whose phone\nconversation reverberated throughout the room, as did his equally loud snoring\nafterwards! My iPad had no charge, unfortunately, so I dozed a bit, sent messages to\nfriends, and had a few snacks (protein bars, Goldfish and water bottles \u00e0 volont\u00e9 in the\nchemo room, plus my yogurt, peach, banana bread and Lacroix sparkling water brought\nfrom home).\nMy reliable neighbor, Janis, drove me to Geisinger (about 10 mn from my home), while\nmy sister \"III C\" Jackie picked me up. We made the now ritual stop afterwards at Meyer's\nDairy for milkshakes (my treat to her this time). I came home to find a large freezer bag\nby my front door; Michael had kindly brought me, as I requested, a large container of\n                       758 / 1.901\nPanera tomato soup, a comforting post-chemo meal. I crashed on the couch and woke up\na few hours later, feeling somewhat refreshed. Didn't move much all evening; the\nOlympics made for good company.\nDidn't sleep great. Awoke every hour or two, to make sure I was ok I suppose and in\nanticipation of side effects. Felt a bit itchy at one point and was focused on keeping well-\nhydrated. So I feel tired today but overall not too roughed up. We'll see what the next\ndays, weeks, months bring. As long as those cancer cells get zapped and my body can\nhandle the treatment without significant diminishing of quality of life (quite ok on that\nscore for now; SO grateful I can receive my treatment here rather than at Hopkins, but I\nam apprehensive about any return trip to the hospital here, which in many ways I find\nsub-par).\nAs always, I'm *immensely grateful* for all the expressions of caring and concern from\nfamily and friends directed towards me over the last few days: texts and calls, responses\non my CB page, gifts (thank you, Paula!), chicken soup (merci, Monique!), offers to\ngrocery shop and run other errands for me, a promise of homemade borscht (Michael\nand Sue) and carrot cake (a local friend, Scott) later today. Full disclosure: being a 'taker'\nis not an unfamiliar role for me, and can actually feel quite good to me, yet at the same\ntime I often feel like I'm 'extorting' the kindness sent my way. Likely more to say about\nthat at some point, but I also hope I can repay (or pay forward) the love and care that\ncontinue to envelope me like a warm blanket.\nA few days ago my therapist and I were discussing items that I plan to carry with me in\nmy metaphorical 'knapsack' as I journey forward. I am *definitely and without any doubt*\ntaking all of you, perhaps first and foremost. I will likely *not* be taking the chorus of\nFuries dominating some of the OC survivors Facebook pages I subscribe to; there is too\nmuch conflicting information/misinformation there, too much catastrophizing (or perhaps\nI'm just in denial about the inevitability of this?), with the terms \"hospice,\" \"angel gained\nher wings,\" \"teal angel,\" etc. jumping out at me each time I sign on. But I *will* be taking\n(for sure) the more measured, smart, well-considered, empathic support of my \"III Cs\"\nJackie, Deb, Helen, Jan and now Brenda. There are several other items I may also be in\nthe midst of 'triaging;' perhaps I'll get to writing about them another time.\nThank you again, everyone. Your support is integral to my staying the course.\n \nPS: Wonder Woman is crushin' those sneaky, aggressive cancer cells!\nP.P.S. My writing today is probably a bit lazy and tired -- like me.  Can't seem to muster\nthe energy to find 'le mot juste,' but will likely revise at some point!\n                       759 / 1.901",

To wit: two vivid dreams on two\nconsecutive nights: 1) I've completely lost control of my class; students are walking in\nand out of the classroom cavalierly and I can't stop them. The scene is spinning out of\ncontrol in other ways too (a persistent sound of sand or gravel crunching in the\nbackground?). A former college classmate, Paul Tavrow, is calling me out for the disarray\nbut the chaos persists; 2) I'm at a conference and haven't written my paper. Somehow\nI've become isolated from the conference regulars, the ones I usually hang out with, and\nam with stuck with two older men who look like scholars from a previous generation (one\nhas a goatee). One of them uses the word \"Soviet\" in relation to his research (indicating\nhow antiquated it is, as in \"Soviet-era\"). The three of us are traversing an uneven\nlandscape dotted with brown turds (!) [my thought here is that this may relate to the arid\nsoil in the community garden plot that I saw my former student/friend Yvonne\noverturning in a video online yesterday].\nI've long had these types of anxiety dreams as the spectre of the academic year's\nbeginning looms, but these had a nightmarish quality. Feeling 'adrift' and 'in transition'\nfor sure these days, the shakiness (walking on an uneven surface?) augmented by all the\nother 'uncertainties' in my life right now. 'Getting a grip' seems fraught; perhaps\ngentleness and self-compassion are the key.\nOn this chemo day +4, I'm at a strong \"B+\" -- feeling slightly tired and even more\nslightly nauseous (did not even take an anti-nausea med today). Trying hard to be a\ngood patient>ample rest, ample hydration, healthy eating (need to start tossing some\nexercise into the mix). Took a restorative multi-hour backroads drive yesterday: the corn\n*is* (nearly) as high as an elephant's eye; the slant of light and mellow warmth hint ever\nso slightly at back to school; Elk, Penn's and Spring Creeks glint and gurgle in the sun;\nbales of hay dot the wide expanses of farmland. My country jaunt purchases included a\ngold metal plate for change (looks vaguely Arabic in design) from my trusty antiques\nstore on Rte 45; a few ears of corn from a roadside stand; new potatoes from \"Mamy's\nDonut Shop\" in Smulton; a luscious tomato from Yoder's farmstand near Aaronsburg, and\na dozen brown eggs from an Amish farm in Madisonburg ($1.75!).\nThank you, Jackie and Clare, for stopping by and to others of you for checking in.

    "entry": "...and some dreams seem to convey the depth of my terror. Taking a short pre-lunch\nbreak to write this one down so I don't forget it (although I'd like to):\nIn a movie theatre or some sort of auditorium to watch a film, performance etc. I believe\nmy mother is near (next to?) me. Suddenly conscious of a man entering the back of the\nauditorium and sense that something ominous will happen. Most everyone seems to\nhave the good sense to crouch down between/below the seats; I do the same and push\nmy mother down too. An eerie stillness; we are obviously sitting ducks with no visible\nmeans of escape. The guy has a gun. He ambles around the auditorium, not saying\nanything, takes aim, then puts the gun down and walks away from it. We/I have literally\n'dodged a bullet.' Huge relief yet still immense apprehension. I am frozen in terror. He\nrepeats this a second time: walks back to the gun, picks it up, takes aim, then puts it\ndown. I've dodged a bullet a second time. I am walking \"through the valley of the\nshadow of death.\" And yes, this happens a third time [= third course of chemo?], but I\nsense he's getting closer. I can simply *feel it in my bones.* This time --in real time (not\nin the dream) -- I literally bolt out of my bed to avoid getting shot and killed. Then I\nrealize it's a dream and go back to bed (about 4 a.m?).\nThese are the terrors that I try hard to keep at bay during the day as I go about my\nbusiness and that flood my dream sleep.

I gotta have faith, as both Dr. Beavis' and Dr. Patel's\nnurses or PAs told me, that it often takes several rounds of chemo to see a drop in the\nCA125 number; moreover, it's likely that the jump up occurred during the several week\ninterval between my recurrence being diagnosed and the beginning of treatment, ie a\nperiod when I was completely off chemo.\n \nAs for the blood work, I had been told that this chemo combo can be harsh on red blood\ncells, white blood cells, platelets, kidneys, and liver (is anything else left?..... the heart, I\nsuppose). So I wasn't completely surprised by the results, ditto for the CA number, but of\ncourse instinctively I wanted to see the numbers trend in the opposite direction. And I\nsurmised that my cells were not being sufficiently oxygenated when I felt myself\nsomewhat winded on exertion several times last week. My kidneys are apparently fine\n(yay kidneys!), which means I've been diligently hydrating. One of my liver function\nmarkers is high (or is that low?). The red blood cell counts are out of whack, ditto the\nwhite blood cell and platelet counts. Counterintuitively, though, Dr. Patel's PA says I am\n                       771 / 1.901\ndoing well (\"I've seen worse\">HA!) and I'm certainly not in the 'critical' range at which\npoint treatment might need to be reassessed or a transfusion ordered. My blood will be\nchecked again before my second round next W, to see if anything has changed. In\ntheory, within two weeks the cells are supposed to rebound. Because of the low counts,\nI'm now prone to bacterial infections, so must avoid gardening (I told the PA that the\nmost 'gardening' I do is to stick a plant into a pot and water it), pumping gas (rarely do it\nmyself), poor 'hand hygiene' (highly unlikely; I'm a compulsive hand washer), large\ncrowds, and other scenarios in which I might be exposed to bacteria.\n \nAt what point might the blood cell counts drop into truly troublesome range? What\nhappens then?  After how many rounds might I expect to see the CA125 number trend in\nthe opposite direction? After how many rounds is it determined that the treatment might\nnot, in fact, be working? And the cancer continues to grow and spread in the meantime?\nSo...much..uncertainty. \n \nBut I gotta have faith...\n \nI am feeling ok. I have energy to work at my desk, write emails, enjoy at least one social\nouting a day, run errands, cook etc. Lifting heavy grocery bags is difficult for me, and not\nadvisable. Driving is no problem, enjoyable. At some point during the day I find myself\nlying on the couch for a bit, but not necessarily napping. I try to sleep as much as I need\nbut struggle with insomnia some nights (even w/an over the counter sleep aid). Everyone\nis telling I look great (WHO KNEW? Cancer is really hilarious sometimes). All kidding\naside, at times I do feel that I look as \"radiant\" as a friend recently claimed I do. I am\nviewing life in technicolor with no filter, communicating soul to soul.  Is this a privilege\nafforded those staring down their own mortality?\n \n                       772 / 1.901\nWe don't have to see eye to eye (Face to face)\nI'm not asking for miracles (No saving grace)\nAnd I don't need another heart (To have and hold)\nAll I want is a friend that I can talk to (Soul to soul)\nSoul to Soul, Soul to soul\n \nI much prefer the Neville Brothers on this, but I'll take the Temptations' version (perhaps\nthe original):\nThe Temptations - Soul To Soul - YouTube\n \nLoading up my social calendar has been a good antidote to getting up close and personal\nwith my mortality 24/7 (so has work; I've returned to an article that I'm very much\nenjoying working on and know exactly where I want to send it). Have had lovely recent\nvisits with Clare (whom I hadn't seen for most of the summer); Jackie (thank you for\npicking up groceries for me!); Scott (thank you for the massive piece of homemade\ncarrot cake); Helen (great catch-up lunch at Caf\u00e9 Lemont); Sandy, Kathryn, and Cheryl\n(what a treat to enjoy an excellent osso buco with three smart, sophisticated, interesting,\nglam and martini-drinking women!); and Ted (lunch/coffee on  a bench at the Military\nMuseum Park, where we talked about everything and noticed the leaves turning yellow\non a peri-autumnal day).  This week hoping to see Monique, Katerina, and my former\ndean (and now, fellow cancer survivor Susan). And tomorrow morning, Mary (and maybe\nothers) for a walk. I am grateful for the opportunity to share what's going on in our\nrespective lives. Soul to soul.\n \nDrove out into the countryside today. The corn really is as high as an elephant's eye\nnow. Bought a few ears of corn at Yoder's farmhouse stand, while a Mennonite woman\nconversed on her cell phone about whether she should buy the huge watermelon\nweighing down the table. Bought a half bushel of plum tomatoes at the Amish farmers\nmarket down the street. I'm feeling tomato sauce: all those fresh tomatoes, plus tomato\n                       773 / 1.901\npaste, onions, red wine, ground carrots, basil, bay leaves, garlic, eggplant and maybe a\nzucchini.

It wasn't so fun(ny) last night when my nose started\nbleeding, because (I surmise) my platelet production is depressed. It was *not* bleeding\nheavily at all, but my nasal membranes felt quite irritated and my nasal mucous was\nbloody. This capped a day that effectively ended about 3 p.m. because I felt so wiped out\nafter walking four laps of the Military Museum track with my friends and then grocery\nshopping at Wegmans. I was mad at myself for my sluggishness -- I had all sorts of plans\n-- but had no choice but to succumb. I went to bed feeling sad and cancerous and bloody\nand alone -- but managed to sleep pretty well (now that Nazi Germany and the French\nRevolutionary Terror have been the backdrops for two of my dreams, I think only the\ngulag is left...).\nBetter today!

    "entry": "777 / 1.901\n                       778 / 1.901\nA shortish update: Round #2 of chemo went smoothly yesterday. While my red and\nwhite blood cell and platelet counts are still wonky (to be expected with the harsh drugs\npumped into my bloodstream), they've avoided falling into critical range, thereby\nforestalling any need to hold off on treatment or consider a transfusion. On the better\nnews front, my liver numbers looked significantly healthier yesterday (they are\n'normalizing') and my kidney function is good (one of the few realms I have control over\nvia hydration, so bring on those fluids!).\nWhat I've been terming 'uncertainty' might better be labeled 'navigating.' This emerged\nas the mot du jour yesterday. Dr. Patel needs to *navigate* between safe and effective\ntreatment. Because of the concerns re my red and white blood cells (and platelets), I\nmust have a low(er) dose of the treatment, but not so low as to be ineffective. It's a\nnumbers game. If the blood cell counts improve, perhaps he can consider a higher dose.\nA higher dose at this point might entail the risk of severe damage to my white blood\ncells>bone marrow, which in the worst case scenario could necessitate a bone marrow\ntransplant. And we don't want that. So for now we are navigating the high seas of the\nchemo ocean, in the hopes that we'll start to see some improvement in the cancer\nmarker later this month (unlike the disappointing twenty point rise we saw this time, also\nnot unusual).\nI don't feel too badly today. I slept pretty well but am tired. Only mild nausea. It is\nsweltering today (I can feel the heat seeping through my study window as I type), so for\nthe most part I'll stay inside and rest, but I've already succeeded in writing a few emails.\nI wrote to both Drs. Patel and Beavis to see when I can get in line for the booster shot to\nbe offered (so I read in the _NYTimes?_) to immunosuppressed and other categories of\nvulnerable people.\nMy chemo day was long, 9:30-5:00, including labwork, a meeting with Dr. Patel's PA to\ngo over the results, and a brief meeting w/Dr. Patel, who explained why he can't raise\nmy dose right now. The hours somehow passed quickly enough, though. Had great plans\nto read, but mainly texted with friends and even dozed for a while. The nurses, as\nalways, were kind, friendly and attentive. The final two hours I receive a diuretic that has\nme going to the bathroom every twenty minutes - not fun. My bighearted neighbor Janis\ndrove me to Scenery Park in the morning and my wonderful friend (and OC survivor)\nJackie picked me up and took me to Meyers Dairy for the ritual milkshake (I opted for a\nrootbeer float w/Chocolate Almond ice cream - so refreshing). My appetite is ridiculously\nhealthy and I fear that soon I will have regained all the weight I've lost in the past two\nyears -- almost 30 pounds. I was definitely too scrawny post-first surgery and can't say I\nlook overweight now (by any means), but I was hoping to come in at at least ten pounds\nunder my pre-chemo weight. Oh well. It's 'insurance,' I guess, for what may lie ahead,\nand the docs seem to think I'm at the right weight (apologies for this utterly vain\n                       779 / 1.901\ndigression).\nA piece of good news: I have the 'all clear' to head to the beach next week for vacay! I'll\nspend the week at an oceanfront hotel in Amagansett, LI (Ben will be w/me and then\nSammi for the weekend). Weather looks perfect. Anticipating reading a novel (or more)\nin a beach chair w/my toes dangling in the ocean, poolside relaxation, food\nshopping/cooking (lobster? ceviche? scallops/shrimp and pasta? Roadside clam shacks?),\ntime w/a dear high school friend, a bit of local tourism. Aim to keep it very chill. I'll drive\nto NJ this coming Monday and meet Ben at the NJ Transit station, from where he'll take\nover the driving. Return scheduled for the 24th in time for my labs, with chemo the next\nday. I can't wait for a week to clear my mind, body and spirit with loved ones.\nThank you, Katerina, for the wonderful catchup at Duffy's once we were booted from the\nPump Station, and to Susan W for a great chat at Panera. Wonderful to see you,\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, as well, even though we had to focus on work! Thank you to everyone for the\ntexts, emails, cards (Melissa, Heather - thank you!), comments on CB, and innumerable\nacts of caring. Please forgive me if I've left anyone out. Chemo brain.\nApologies if this post is not completely '\u00e0 la hauteur.' I may have a bit of brain fog from\nchemo. Time for a shower, two quick errands, and then to the chemo den/sun room with\na book!",

I don't want to look yet (too anxious), but I'll do\nso (I think) before chemo. I'm worried about the possibility that my CA 125 may have\nrisen again. I'm concerned that there is a lymph node with cancer on it lying against my\nstomach. Perhaps it might be removed? Must ask. Am feeling generally well overall. I get\nwinded on exertion (that's the chemo targeting my red and white blood cells). Cancer is\nwith me 24/7 though, for sure, and dread is never too far from the surface. But I keep on\nkeepin' on.\nVacation in Amagansett helped.\nThis Pisces loves water and the elements were healing. Sun, wind, surf, sand, clouds. I\ndid need to cover b/c of chemo-related sun sensitivity. The first day on the beach, I\ndozed somewhat troubledly, as if my mind needed to rid itself of some bile (there was\nalso a strange dream that first night, which I'll relay later). The following days, though, I\nfelt much more in harmony with my surroundings, shed some of my anxiety, and was\nable to enjoy one of my favorite activities: getting lost in a good novel at the beach (in\nthis case, the wonderful _All the Light We Cannot See,_ by Th. Doerr). Other activities\n(beyond the luxury of quality time with Ben and Sammi): a morning yoga class on the\nbeach, which I dedicated (per the teacher's suggestion) to my pursuit of wellness. Was\nunable to do bridge and a few other poses because my surgeries wreaked havoc on my\nabdominal muscles, and I did get a bit winded (made sure to be gentle w/myself and not\ngive myself a hard time about my underwhelming yoga 'performance') but did feel sore\nthe next day, which I was glad for; a few nice meals out w/Ben (super fresh, delicious\nsashimi at the Westlake Fish House in Montauk; excellent Mexican [roast LI duck in\npomegranate/apricot sauce] at Coche + killer Mezcal drinks -- Ben offered me a taste) +\nan equally yummy meal  we cooked once Sammi arrived (linguine in pesto w/fresh\nscallops bought at Stuart's, a longstanding fish+++ store in E. Hampton); E. Hampton\nfarmers market (hideously overpriced and no better than our local ones); a quick coffee\nand catch up with a dear grade school friend of 50-ish (??) years, Eva, who lives in Sag\nHarbor year-round. We only had time to scratch the surface but it was so heartwarming\nto reconnect. Her stepson is a first-year student at Penn State, so hopefully we'll be able\nto visit again in State College when she's next there. We have such a long history and so\nmany shared memories -- plus an 'older and wiser' perspective on some of the path\nwe've travelled too.\nWe abbreviated our stay by 1.5 days to avoid the approaching hurricane, but\nnevertheless had a hellacious drive back to NY Saturday night -- pounding rain, godawful\ntraffic. Foodies that the three of us are, though, we nevertheless made a 20 minute+\ndetour to enjoy pizza at a 'real deal' LI pizza parlor, Umberto's in Sayville, which Ben and\nSammi had discovered on a previous trip to the Island. Amazingly good.\n                       783 / 1.901\n\u05dd\u05dc\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05e8\u05de\u05d2\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e9 ,\u05d9\u05dc\u05d0 ,\u05d9\u05dc\u05d0\n\u05dd\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4\n\u05dd\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e9 \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05e8\n\u05dd\u05d9\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1\n\u05dd\u05d3\u05d0\u05d4 \u05ea\u05dc\u05d9\u05e4\u05ea\nMy God, My God, I pray that these things never end,\nThe sand and the sea,\nThe rustle of the waters,\nLightning of the Heavens,\nThe prayer of Man.\n \nHannah Senesh, 1942\n \nI spent two nights in the city at my mother's once we got off the Island. Ben was kind\nenough to drive me out of the city so I could avoid the city traffic, Holland tunnel, and\nconfusing web of highways around Newark, then I drove the remaining 3++ hours back\nhome. I found it tiring.\nThe dream: I'm going to a new therapist, perhaps one that my current therapist has\nrecommended. It will be a therapy group. A youngish guy (blond hair, wire rimmed\nglasses, kind of 'crunchy granola' looking) tells me about it -- he may even be a member,\nbut he quickly drops out of the dream. The therapist (and group leader) is a  fairly stylish\nyoungish woman with dark hair; she seems a bit harried getting ready for the group but\nwarmly shakes my hand. Once in the room with the other members, she puts her cheek\nagainst mine as a kind of welcome. When I either tell her or indicate otherwise that I\ndon't find that gesture appropriate in a group therapy setting, she kind of snorts and\nsays: \"Well, you want to have your cake and eat it too!\" The group members are\nnumerous and all women. On first glance I realize that I know many of them. One is a\nlocal acquaintance/friend, Jean N., who greets me very warmly in front of everyone\n(thereby revealing that she knows me). Another women, Lynn S., is a former staff\nassistant in the Dean's office who (in reality) passed away two years ago at age 60 - I\ndon't know how. Another woman [in the dream, not in reality] is someone I know from\nHolocaust teaching/research circles. Because there are so many women in the group,\nthis last woman is sitting at a desk in a secondary ring of chairs/desks around the first\none. This clues me into the fact that the set up bears some resemblance to a\nclassroom/seminar room.  What I can fathom from this dream is that a group of close\nwomen friends may represent *one* (but not the only...) prominent form of sociability for\n                       784 / 1.901\nme now that I've retired, replacing - or overlapping - my school/teaching networks. The\npresence of a staff colleague who died at around my age (as well as a Holocaust\nresearcher?) seems obvious in its significance. I'm really not sure what to make of the\nrest. But I'm sure my therapist will have some ideas on Friday!\nThe fall semester started yesterday. It feels strange not to be teaching. I miss the energy\nof the first day of classes, the adrenaline rush. I miss interacting with students (ie\nundergraduates as I am still working with several graduate students). I don't miss the\nadmin stuff though, to be honest, especially in this challenging environment. A fear:\nbecoming irrelevant, marginal, de trop, lacking opportunities to be helpful.\nThe holidays are almost here.  I'll celebrate my *third* new year since my diagnosis.

    "entry": "A brief update as I'm wiped out from yesterday's chemo session. Everything went\nsmoothly but it's a long day -- 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m.! -- requiring much physical/mental\nwherewithal. I always bring lots of reading, projects etc. but usually just wind up dozing,\nwriting to friends etc. It seems to be hard for me to concentrate on much else, and of\ncourse I'm conscious of the presence of other patients too, although curtains provide\nsome privacy. A favorite nurse, Brianne, kept me covered in warm blankets, well-stocked\nwith water and snacks, and generally very well cared for. My kind neighbor, Janis, woke\nup earlier than she usually does to drive me to Scenery Park and my steadfast friend,\nJackie, picked me up and treated me to -- wait for it! -- a milkshake at Meyer's Dairy (a\nchocolate marshmallow malted milkshake, to be precise).\nThe chemo continues to batter my red and white blood cells; my hemoglobin production\nis even lower than two weeks ago. And that makes me tired. On the (much) better news\nfront, though, my CA125 level dropped from the higher than considered normal 51\nearlier this month to 29 U/ml two days ago! This is a significant drop, which suggests the\ntreatment is working (I say 'suggests' because this marker is not a hard and faster\nindicator -- another uncertainty -- although for me it's been a pretty reliable one). So I'm\n                       789 / 1.901\nback into a range considered normal (<38 U/ml), although my normal is more like 11-13.\nHopefully next month I will see the indicator drop even further. I've mentioned before the\nstress of feeling like I'm living/dying by a number, the feeling of 'retraumatization' every\ntime I see an increase and, conversely, the tears of relief and gratitude I cry (my body\nliterally shakes) every time I see a decrease.\nCurrent plan: one more round of chemo (under current regimen) in two weeks. Then\nscan (abdomen/pelvis/lungs). Then (re)assessment, with my oncs, of where things stand\nand what future treatment may entail. At that point, I also want to get a 'bigger picture'\nsense of what my long(er) term treatment may be going forward. Dr. Beavis spoke of\nseveral 'back pocket' options. I will keep my eyes on emerging clinical trials. Perhaps\nanother parp inhibitor is in store, perhaps further rounds of the current regimen if it\ncontinues to be effective. \nBlood pressure good, platelet production seems to have increased since last time - also\ngood. V. tired today, as mentioned, but hope to begin rebounding a bit tomorrow. I made\nit to the farmers market and to my favorite drive through caf\u00e9 for an iced latte, but\nenvision an afternoon at least partly on the couch in my 'chemo den'/sunroom, beating\nthe heat, tucking into _The Handmaid's Tale_ (which somehow I have never read).\nAs expected, I feel 'unmoored' not being on campus, in the classroom, in my office, with\nmy faculty and staff colleagues, and students -- some of my 'happy places.' I knew that\nlow-grade depression was going to hit me as I experienced this loss (props to Lexapro).\nI'm still working through it as I continue to transition to a schedule (even if it's a non-\nschedule) that makes sense for me and motivates me. On the other hand, I am\ncategorically certain that I'd be unable to handle the rigors of my\nteaching/administering/researching schedule right now, and am grateful to be able to\navail myself of the resources necessary for me to focus primarily on wellness.\n\"God grant me the serenity To accept the things I cannot change; Courage to change the\nthings I can; And wisdom to know the difference. Living one day at a time; Enjoying one\nmoment at a time.\" Reinhold Niebuhr\nMuch gratitude to the friends/family who checked in with me yesterday,\nbefore/during/after chemo, via text, email, grocery shopping, rides etc. The uplift is very\nbeneficial to me on a day when I need all the strength and courage I can muster. Thank\nyou: Ben, Mom, Ethan, Eve, Maria, Jackie, Janis, Monique, Scott, Helen, Clare, Michael\n[*please* forgive me if I haven't listed you here; admittedly, I was experiencing some\n'brain fog' yesterday.

    "entry": ">This is a *reprint* from my entries for Rosh Hashanah 5070 and 5071. Interesting for\nme to look back on them now. I will post again soon about my *third* opportunity to\ncelebrate the new year since my diagnosis. Grateful:\n \nSeptember 18, 2020 - Happy birthday to the world\nJournal Entry by Willa Silverman \u2014 September 18, 2020\nThis is the second New Year I've been able to welcome in since my \"alive day\" last May. \nSo -- and because I'm a bit rushed right now getting ready for the holiday -- I will, for the\nfirst time, post a 'reprint' from last 29 September. So much has changed since then.\nCOVID has upended our lives - irrevocably? My mother and I have enjoyed many a Rosh\nHashanah here together: she comes up to State College, we cook up a storm, go to\nservices followed by a nice lunch, then tashlich, marked by a pleasant stroll in Walnut\nCreek Park with other congregants. This year I'm solo -- I'm sad to be without my family,\nbut I'm ok. And traditions must continue! Last year, as I recall, I felt very worn out (I was\n                       792 / 1.901\nundergoing my first course of chemo) but still managed to whip up a brisket with\npomegranate sauce. This year I'm feeling stronger -- undergoing \"second line\" treatment\nfor a recurrence, but I seem to be responding quite well. No hair loss, better energy,\nworking full time. I had chemo yesterday but still had ample energy to make chicken\nsoup, honey cakes and a plum compote w/vanilla and cardamon. For the rest of the meal\nI splurged and ordered a big boxload of goodies from Zabar's -- matzah balls, chopped\nliver, herring in cream sauce, noodle pudding, gefilte fish and a round challah (a lovely\nfellow congregant also brought me a round challah today - so kind of her).  I think I'll\ndress cute, putting on a new skirt I ordered from Anne-Elisabeth in Paris, my favorite\nshop for clothes.  At 8 I'll Zoom into services w/my congregation; ditto for tomorrow\nmorning. And if I have the energy (I often go into a post-chemo crash after two days), I'll\nperform tashlich beside one of our pretty local streams.  I hope I can make it.\nI am fine. And I received the good news this morning that my CA125 level has dropped\ntwo more points, to 17 from 19 - still trending in a good direction. I think I'll have a glass\nof wine to celebrate the birthday of the world. Let's hope for a better 5781 than the year\nbefore. We need it.\nBlessings to all.\nLast year's post:\nToday is the birthday of the world, Jewish tradition teaches, a time of renewal and hope\nfor the year ahead. We've fully entered the month of elul, which coincides with early\nautumn, and the \"Days of Awe:\" Rosh Hashanah, on which our fate for the new year is\nwritten, and Yom Kippur, on which it is is sealed. Our lives are depicted as being in the\nbalance during these days before the 'gates close:' \"who shall live to a ripe old age and\nwho shall lie dying on a bed of pain?\" It's an existential state; we're truly 'on the narrow\nbridge.' We beat our chests as we catalog the sins that we've been guilty of the past\nyear. Yet we are told that teshuvah (repentence or return), tefillah (prayer) and tzedakah\n(charity) can temper the harshness of God's decree.\nHaving had to confront my own mortality over the past few months, the spiritual side of\nmy journey has come into fuller relief, including during the holidays. I'll welcome the\nopportunity at dinner tonight, while blessing a round challah, symbol of the cycle of life,\nand later at services, to tap into feelings of hopefulness, renewal, and immanence. To\nEmily Dickinson, hope is \"the thing with feathers-/That perches in the soul-\" that can be\nheard in \"the chillest land-/And on the strangest Sea-\" I've indeed felt glimmers of hope\nin the 'chillest land' and 'strangest Sea' where I've found myself struggling over the past\nfew months. As for my fate, it surely lies somewhere at the intersection of the designs of\nsome nasty, aggressive, microscopic cancer cells, the skills of my medical team, and my\nown fighting spirit. \n                       793 / 1.901\nI am spiritual, yet agnostic. I apologize if this offends any believers who may be reading\nthis. But I do firmly believe in the manifestation of 'godly' qualities in people, animals,\nand nature, whether it be loving kindness, graciousness, mercifulness, or compassion. I\nhave seen these attributes displayed time and time again since my diagnosis, whether\nthrough friends coming to spend time with me, text or call me, send me thoughtful gifts,\nvolunteer to do errands for me, cook for me, drive me to Baltimore, or just 'hold space'\nfor me. It is quite wondrous. \nIt is a wonderful holiday this year because my mother and Ben are here. My mother and I\nhave been cooking up a storm; I'm not quite sure how I managed to pull it off as at the\nbeginning of the week I was completely wiped out from chemo, but I was searing brisket\nand frying onions in pomegranate molasses early this morning. I was hoping that Ben\nmight take some interest in the holiday cooking (he certainly does in the eating), as I'm\nnot sure who will continue the culinary traditions after my mother and me.",

    "entry": "794 / 1.901\n                       795 / 1.901\nI wasn't able to receive chemo yesterday. Both my hemoglobin and platelets had again\ndecreased in volume/number, not uncommon with this treatment. The  last round of\nchemo, two weeks ago, really wiped me out and it took me a full week to recover (I spent\nan *entire day* curled up on the couch in my nightgown, devoid of energy and in a\nstrange mental state as Hurricane Ida wreaked collateral damage outside in the form of\na monsoon-like rain all day). The second week I felt better but still winded on exertion,\neven fairly minimal exertion. My heart has to pump faster/harder to ensure adequate\nblood flow, and hence sufficient oxygen flow throughout my body. Thankfully, I have a\nhealthy heart as excess pressure on it can lead to no good, just as a steep decline in\nplatelets, in the event of a cut or infection, can lead to no good. As I had mentally\nprepared myself for chemo, arriving at Dr. Patel's office bright and early w/all my 'gear'\n(lunch, novel, masks, cozy PSU hoodie), steeled for an eight-hour day in the infusion\nroom, I felt frustrated when Dr. Patel's PA told me that the doctor advised waiting\nanother week to play it safe. I was likely somewhat pissy with Mary Beth (despite my\nRosh Hashanah resolution to be more patient), attempting to extort 'guarantees' from\nher that waiting another week would not give those sneaky cancer cells license to swarm\nback in. I seemed unable to channel the frustration in a less childish way... :( So next\nweek it is, likely on Yom Kippur..... which I don't feel great about, although the dramatic\npotential of offering prayers of supplication to be sealed in the Book of Life for another\nyear at the same time as life-preserving/destroying poison is being shot through my\nveins has not been lost on me...\n \nThe holiday, though, was lovely. After spending last year's holiday on my own and\nattending services virtually, this year, per tradition, my mother was able to make the trip\nfrom NY on the Megabus, bearing a beautiful round challah (=plenitude, the 'circle' of\nthe year that is ending) from Breads Bakery. So grateful she was able to spend the\nholiday here! We had a lovely time together. Per tradition as well, I spent about four\ndays cooking , the last two assisted by my mother. My meal featured traditional dishes\nwith a twist: chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (shallots, Port, butter, heavy cream), semi-sour pickles,\nchicken soup w/matzah balls (the latter containing ginger, nutmeg, paprika, fresh\nparsley, onions and schmaltz), brisket in pomegranate sauce, noodle kugel w/apples and\nraisins, tzimmes, green beans, honey cake w/stone fruit compote (peaches and plums,\nlemon peel) for dessert, an excellent red (Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape). I love table d\u00e9cor and\nenjoy setting an eye-catching table.  I invited my neighbors (and fellow congregants),\nRon and Carol Hodes. While we had never socialized in this way, we had a convivial\ndinner, the homey food and good wine loosening our tongues and spirits. I am still eating\nleftovers.\nIt is all partly a hommage to my E. European born grandmother Bessie and great-\ngrandmother (bubbie) Bella, who also spent days in the kitchen so that we could be\nushered into the overheated kitchen on holidays with indescribably delicious scents (I'm\n                       796 / 1.901\nremembering 'sweet' and 'schmaltz' -- chicken fat, which was their stealth ingredient).\nEvery dish had been cooking, it seemed, for hours if not days -- the chicken soup was a\ndeep yellow (and yes, redolent with schmaltz) while the tin foil that had covered \nroasting pans was now coated with a layer of dark caramelized something. My\ngrandmother lived in a five floor brownstone on E. 94th st. (between Fifth and Madison)\nthat featured a *dumbwaiter* for hoisting food from the kitchen to the large dining room\nabove, whose sideboard groaned with delicious desserts (my favorites were chocolate\ncovered orange peels and a g\u00e2teau St. Honor\u00e9 with cream puffs) from William Greenberg\nbakery or Madison Avenue - oh, and a homemade teiglach, small hard dough balls bound\ntogether with honey in a pyramid, and studded with dried fruits and nuts. Aside from the\ntraditional Ashkenazi holiday dishes, my grandmother's table also boasted a roast beef\nand ...spaghetti and meat balls.\nThis year Ben and a few friends ordered RH dinner from a Montreal-style place in\nBrooklyn, Mile End (Ben and I actually went on a Jewish foods walking tour of this\nneighborhood), making me optimistic that he will carry on the traditions in some way.\nI've begun writing down all the recipes for him in a lovely blank leather-bound book\ngifted me by my grad students. My recipe for \"Mom's Chicken Soup\" is five pages,\nincluding all my tips!\nIt was heartening, on Monday evening and Tuesday, to return to the synagogue\nsanctuary for the first time in at least two (?) years and to greet friends/congregants.\nWhile - to be candid - most of the prayers do not resonate with me, the meaning of the\nholiday -- hope to be 'renewed' for another year and  forgiven for 'sins' against God and\nother people (I was focusing on impatience, lack of compassion at times, and lack of\nsufficient care towards my body) -- is not inconsequential for me.\nThe following always stick with me, though, and have become mantras:\n{Something like}: \"May you walk with good companions.\" As I've stated before, I am\nvery blessed to \"walk with good companions\" and I wish the same for everyone I know\nand care about.\nAlso: [something like] \"With hope in our hearts and eternity in our souls.\" \nI have read a lot about this verse (from Ecclesiastes but must also exist in the Torah in\nsome form too) and about various translations of the word 'olam' (as darkness but also\neternity), but I can only offer what it means to me at this point in time: not a hope for\neternal life (which, if it means a hope for an afterlife, I do not believe in) but simply some\nsense of transcendence -- that there is some dimension to life that is not immediately\nvisible or perceptible to us, but that is *there.* This is the part that I am hopeful endures,\nincluding in memory. I'm probably not explaining this well, but out of the entire service it\nis the verse that makes me feel calm and at peace.\n                       797 / 1.901\nI also read a poem that resonated with me before dinner on erev RH. While I'm a bit\nembarrassed to admit that it's by a seeming self-help guru (with a Jewish slant), Dawna\nMarkova, it seems nevertheless to describe my current path:\nI will not die an unlived life,\nI will not live in fear\nOf falling or catching fire.\n \nI choose to inhabit my days\nTo allow my living to open me,\nTo make me less afraid,\nmore accessible,\nTo loosen my heart\nUntil it becomes a wing,\nA torch, a promise.\n \nI choose to risk my significance: to live\nSo that which came to me as seed\nGoes to the next as blossom\nAnd that which came to me as blossom\nGoes on as fruit.\n***\nRhonda stopped treatment three months ago and her cancer has progressed, making\nher day to day activities more difficult. Rhonda is a 'teal sister' whom I've never met\nexcept virtually, but who is also treated for ovarian cancer at Hopkins. Rhonda is the\n                       798 / 1.901\nfellow survivor who gifted me the beautiful pendant I am wearing right now, with the\ncancer ribbon and the Hebrew for \"be strong and of good courage\" inscribed on it; I told\nher I will 'pay it forward' when/if the time comes by gifting the pendant to another\nsurvivor. Rhonda is moving forward without fear of the unknown; palliative and hospice\ncare can be instrumental shorter- or longer-term methods for facilitating a beautiful end\nof life and a 'good death.' Rhonda inspires me to keep eternity in my soul [and heart and\nmind].\n***\nI have been binging documentaries (my favorite film genre) about highly creative,\ncomplex, and often dark people (who happen to all be men, in this section of my binge). I\nam enthralled by what motivates them, their creative process, their lives, their struggles.\nHence: _Roadrunner_ (excellent doc about Anthony Bourdain); Scorsese's two-part doc,\n_George Harrison: Living in the Material World_ (the 'quiet Beatle' has always been my\nfavorite - a brilliant, deeply spiritual musician); _Bitchin:' The Sound and Fury of Rick\nJames_ (I danced my ass off to his music in college, but didn't realize how rich his legacy\nwas -- from the ghetto in Buffalo to the Toronto music scene in the 1960s with Neil\nYoung, to anti-war protestor and 'draft dodger' during the Vietnam War, to Motown to a\nsad demise; _Street Songs_ is a brilliant album); _The Bee Gees: How Can you Mend a\nBroken Heart_ (HBO) - say what you will, the Gibb brothers were/are (Barry) major\ntalents (and I'll readily admit that _Saturday Night Fever_ is a prime 'soundtrack of your\nlife' album for me).\nAlso trying to catch up on classics that I never got around to reading, currently _The\nHandmaid's Tale.\" Very OMG in the current context but Margaret Atwood not my favorite\ncontemporary author. looking forward to the new Colson Whitehead, coming out soon.\n \n.\u05d4\u05b6\u05bc\u05d6\u05b7\u05d4 \u05df\u05b7\u05de\u05b0\u05bc\u05d6\u05b7\u05dc \u05bc\u05d5\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d2\u05b4\u05d4\u05b0\u05d5 \u05bc\u05d5\u05e0\u05b8\u05de\u05b0\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05e7\u05b0\u05d5 \u05bc\u05d5\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9\u05b1\u05d7\u05b6\u05d4\u05b6\u05c1\u05e9 ,\u05dd\u05b8\u05dc\u05b9\u05d5\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 \u05b0\u05da\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05de ,\u05bc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d4\u05b9\u05dc\u05b1\u05d0 \u05b8\u05d9\u05b0\u05d9 ,\u05d4\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b7\u05d0 \u05b0\u05da\u05bc\u05d5\u05e8\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\nTRANSLITERATION\n                       799 / 1.901\nBaruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, shehecheyanu, v'kiy'manu,\nv'higiyanu laz'man hazeh.\nTRANSLATION\nBlessed are You, Adonai our God, Sovereign of all, who has kept us alive, sustained\nus, and brought us to this season.\nWHO HAS KEPT US ALIVE, SUSTAINED US, AND BROUGHT US TO THIS SEASON.\n \np.s.

    "entry": "A health update first: as you may know from recent posts, I was unable to receive my\ntreatment last week because my hemoglobin and white blood cell/platelet counts were\ntoo low. I was disappointed and probably did not handle that feeling as well as I could\nhave but I got with the program relatively quickly. After all, delays in chemo are not\nuncommon given the havoc the toxins can wreak on one's system. \nFortunately, the week's wait was helpful. Although I had to get up early to have my blood\ntested before heading off to Yom Kippur morning services -- no fasting for me this year --\nthe results were, on the whole, encouraging. Both my hemoglobin and platelet counts\nhad improved, and my magnesium count - another source of some concern - had also\nshown improvement. I was too nervous to look at my CA125 number until the following\nday, after a wretched, anxious sleep and right before leaving earlier than I'm used to for\nchemo (thank you to my stalwart, kind neighbor Janis for driving me there), but that too\nis trending in a better direction, decreasing from about 29 last time to about 22 this\ntime, after a 51 to 29 decrease between the previous two treatments! All of this made\nme feel encouraged, to say the least, and Dr. Patel's PA (to whom I apologized for being\nsnippy the previous week -- this was the Day of Atonement after all) ok'd me for\ntreatment. \nSomehow treatment day -- 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. -- passes. I slept a bit. Texted friends. Ate\nlunch (delicious yogurt my friend David made for me, which I mixed with local honey,\nslivered almonds and golden raisins). My very kind, highly efficient nurse, Brianne, talked\nabout her growing up in a heavily Jewish area in New Jersey, so she knows from chicken\nmatzah ball soup, bagels and lox, and the high holidays -- a refreshing change in a\ncommunity where the HHs usually go completely under the radar. I promised to give her\na copy of my soup/matzah ball recipe, the one I wrote out for Ben with all my tips. My\ndear friend Maria picked me up, bearing the turkey chili I had asked her to pick up for me\nfrom Wegman's, and knew to whisk me right to Meyer's dairy for the now customary post-\nchemo ice cream treat (Otto's root beer float w/coconut chip ice cream for me, a quart of\nice cream for her to take home). We sat at a picnic table in the sun, catching up and\ngabbing, before Maria's ice cream showed some signs of melting. When I got home I was\nso tired I crashed on the cozy couch in my sun room/'chemo den,' then spent a relaxing\nevening resting and watching t.v.\nToday I didn't get out of bed until close to 11, rallied for breakfast, then had to lie down\nagain. Somehow by 2 p.m. I rallied again, showered, then took a long drive (as I'm wont\nto do...) along country backroads, discovering some new ones that will keep me sourced\nwith delicious brown eggs and freshly made apple cider (unpasteurized, hope that's ok\n                       815 / 1.901\nfor my fragile immune system but it looked so tasty... maybe if I boil it and drink it hot\nspiced). Stopped at 'my' antiques store, The Beaten Path; if anything can rouse me, it's\nantiquing! Bought a cute blingy baroque-ish trinket holder for $3; a set of five Art Deco\nap\u00e9ritif glasses (great design); and - wait for it - ten brass (?) napkin holders in the shape\nof turkeys! These will complement my burgeoning collection of 'Thanksgiviana' - all\nbought at antiques stores: vintage Thanksgiving postcards, a cool 1950s set of nesting\n(like Russian dolls) turkeys, etc. Now just need to figure out the Thanksgiving plans for\nthis year...\nI hope to feel well enough to have dinner at friends' house tomorrow night to celebrate a\nbook publication but will see how I feel tomorrow when I wake up. Don't want to overdo\nit.\nIn two weeks I will have a scan (pelvis/abdomen/chest) -- by which point I will be in full-\nthrottle 'scanxiety' over what it might reveal (or not???) - followed by an appointment\nwith Dr. Patel the following week to consult about the treatment plan (presumably,\nhopefully in consultation w/Dr. Beavis; I will, in fact, insist on it). At this point, I will want\nto ask questions about the longer term: how much treatment can my body safely\nabsorb? At what point will we exhaust treatment options? It is possible -- as a next\nappointment was already scheduled for three weeks from now-- that since my current\ntreatment is working effectively, I will continue with it for a while, or until it is not longer\nworking.  I need to discuss options, plans. So.much.uncertainty.\nHappy, though, to have a three-week break from chemo.\nYom Kippur came and went this past week (Wednesday evening and Thursday). My kind\nneighbors and fellow congregants, Carol and Ron, reciprocated my erev Rosh Hasahanah\ninvite by having me over for erev Yom Kippur dinner - more chicken soup and brisket\nwas consumed! During services, again, I let my mind wander, making a mental checklist\nof 'sins' or infractions I may have committed (more than a few, according to the lists we\nrecited) and thinking about how I could do better. I could not help but feel a big \"UGH\"\naround one of the holiday's central questions: who will be sealed for another year of life,\nwho shall not, and by what means might literal or figurative 'death' occur (not just \"who\nby fire\" but also \"who will wander...who will suffer\"). This brought to mind the Leonard\nCohen song, \"Who by Fire:\"\nAnd who by fire, who by water,\nwho in the sunshine, who in the night time,\nwho by high ordeal, who by common trial,\nwho in your merry merry month of may,\nwho by very slow decay,\nand who shall I say is calling?\nAnd who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate,\n                       816 / 1.901\nwho in these realms of love, who by something blunt,\nand who by avalanche, who by powder,\nwho for his greed, who for his hunger,\nand who shall I say is calling?\nAnd who by brave assent, who by accident,\nwho in solitude, who in this mirror,\nwho by his lady's command, who by his own hand,\nwho in mortal chains, who in power,\nand who shall I say is calling?\nAs I think I've written before -- and I sincerely hope not to offend the religious convictions\nof those more strictly observant than I am -- I don't believe that my fate is \"in God's\nhands\" but will depend, rather, on the wiles of sneaky cancer cells and the ability of my\nmedical team to beat them back for as long as possible. My \"positive attitude\" will not\nchange anything physiologically, as far as I know, but will help me navigate this difficult\njourney in terms of my emotions, mental state etc. (w/a shout out to Lexapro and my\ntherapist). In this regard, the loving support of my family and friends -- especially those\nof you dear ones who have been \"ride or die\" since the very beginning -- wingpeople\nextraordinaires -- has been a constant uplifting balm. I am so grateful.\nSo I found myself sitting in the sanctuary, drawn to certain passages, sound bites and\nprayers (Psalm 27 is one that calms me), thinking about the essence of the holiday being\nabout love on some level, and simply hoping (wishing? praying?) to be here again next\nyear. I so very much want to be.\nI livestreamed the Neilah service on Thursday at 7 p.m. - the climax of the holiday when\n\"the doors of the ark are closing\" and we are sending up the final supplications for the\nyear ahead, only to be awoken to the urgent matter at hand, ie living, by the blasts of\nthe shofar. I was really connecting with the service when.... it suddenly cut off (I don't\nbelieve it was a connectivity issue), which was frustrating but oh well. I treated myself to\na Trader Joe's bagel with smoked salmon, an adequate reminder of the delectable spread\nwe used to have at our synagogue's post-Yom Kippur 'break the fast' (cancelled this year\nout of COVID precautions).\nThank you to everyone who texted, sent cards, emailed etc. before/during/after\nyesterday's chemo. It makes me feel surrounded by love and caring!\n \n \n \n                       817 / 1.901",

    "entry": "818 / 1.901\n                       819 / 1.901\nI will appreciate any and all good thoughts, healing energy etc. you care to send my way\ntomorrow when my abdomen, pelvis and chest are scanned beginning at 9 a.m. I\nimagine that the scan will be with contrast, which means no breakfast and drinking a lot\nof yucky stuff before the scan. It takes a few days for the radiologists here to produce a\nreport on the scan, and I'll have a disc made so I can send it to Dr. Beavis as well for the\nHopkins' radiologists to read. My inclination is not to look at the report myself before I\ncan discuss it with the doctors. I can't always parse the technical language, which results\nin confusion and anxiety for me, and don't need any excuse to *avoid* knowing the\nresults for as long as possible. Ignorance = bliss?\nThe scanning experience tends to be retraumatizing for me. I can picture the alarmed\nexpressions on the doctors' faces when my (plentiful) cancer first showed up on a scan in\nthe ER in March or April 2019, and then again a few months ago, also in the ER. I am\nanxious about the discrepancy between my still well-put together exterior (everyone\nseems to think I look good and I do take some comfort from that fact) and the cellular\nhavoc that may be occurring underneath/inside it. I hope the cancer hasn't metastasized\nfurther, endangering other organs; well, I'll find out soon enough. I feel a little bit\nbloated, but perhaps that's from the butter pecan ice cream cone I indulged in today!\nA very wise, compassionate and kind friend helped me get out of a funk last week. I had\nsort of worried myself into a corner, trying to figure out if I should devote my energies to\npreparing to die (eg downsizing, fine-tuning my will, general putting my affairs in order\netc.) or continuing to live (eg working on the article that's currently engrossing me;\nsticking to my current routines etc.); the latter option is of course what my oncologists\nhave been promoting all along. My friend pointed out that, in some sense, this is the\nexistential dilemma we all face (ie how to confront the fact that we are mortal and how\nto live meaningfully with this fact in mind) but that this dilemma may well seem more\nsalient in my case because of a potentially (likely?) shorter lifespan. I noted (and she did\ntoo) that I often set up false dichotomies for myself, falling prey to 'either/or' thinking\nrather than what she called 'and/and' thinking: giving away about six large boxes of\nBen's baby clothes and toys the other day, for example, does serve the 'downsizing' goal\nbut also helps create a less cluttered, less encumbered environment for myself that is a\nhealthier space in which for me to thrive/focus on living. I'm not sure this makes sense. It\nmay seem very obvious. In any event, I am grateful to my friend for helping me get\n'unstuck' (during an always fun jaunt to an antiques store) and also helping me figure\nout how I want to focus my energies: quality time with loved ones and some research\nprojects are two pleasurable/meaningful activities that come to mind immediately.\nAlthough I definitely hope to get to Paris sooner rather than later, I am not particularly\ninvested in changing my routines dramatically at this point or in completing any sort of\n'bucket list.' A day that is wonderfully 'normal' in its routines can seem like a gift these\ndays. We'll see if that changes over the next stretch, post-scan and discussions with my\n                       820 / 1.901\noncologists.\nMeanwhile, life continues. The weather has been glorious. Today a dear friend and I\nenjoyed lunch outdoors at the arboretum (a bit comically, our peaceful moment was\ninterrupted by earsplitting construction noise, perhaps in view of a new parking\ngarage?). There has also been a pleasant visit (also outdoors in the sun) from another\nwise friend, an outing to see Los Lobos in concert at the State Theatre (yay to evening\nentertainment resuming!), another lunch outdoors at Caf\u00e9 Lemont, a friend's birthday\nparty, and a dinner party with friends (likely a prelude to another antiquing trip this\nSaturday), a long drive in the country, and much work on an article. I am so grateful to\nknow that I will get to see the fall foliage this year; this \"season of mists and mellow\nfruitfulness\" is my favorite.\nA p.s. for State College peeps: if anyone reading this works with a housecleaner they\nmight 'lend' me for occasional or regular visits please let me know. I let go my longtime\nhousecleaner (whom I was close to) because she wouldn't get vaccinated, and I'm afraid\nthat ship has sailed now. I started to work with someone else who was very good, but\nshe found a permanent job of a different type. I am last on a very long waiting list with a\ncleaning service. Unfortunately, I don't have the physical wherewithal to do deep\ncleaning right now and I really need some help.

    "entry": "826 / 1.901\n                       827 / 1.901\nI greatly appreciate all the shows of concern while I await the results of my scan.\nUnfortunately but not unexpectedly really, my scan revealed progression of my cancer. I\nreceived that news from Dr. Beavis via email as I was driving (fortunately, to my\ntherapist's) and my heart started racing, although the phrase \"many options\" reversed\nthat thumping a bit. Tumors in my pelvic/abdominal area have increased in size (by mm)\nand several lymph nodes in the abdomen and chest area (and maybe shoulder?) have\nenlarged. In better news, there is no visible cancer in my lungs nor in my liver. Dr.\nBeavis, with whom I videoconferenced for about an hour yesterday, explained, very\nclearly, how and why my CA125 number could have decreased while my cancer\nprogressed (it has to do with the inability of a protein on the surface of cells to 'express'\nitself as the cells undergo mutations -- at least that's what I understood given  my limited\namount of scientific literacy). It is also possible to look well (as I believe I do) while\ncancer cells wreak havoc below the surface.  I've got to imagine, though, that a 'put\ntogether' appearance is helpful on some level, as it tends to make me feel more\n'collected.'\nIn her words, my cancer is \"not going away\" -- something I also understood intuitively\nbut understand in a more visceral way now. At the same time, I think she said something\nabout my having \"many years.\" However, I also 'did the math,' with the knowledge that\nsuccessive treatments are successful for progressively shorter and shorter amounts of\ntime -- and the number of treatment options is limited (although many trials are ongoing,\nincluding one involving immunotherapy that may be starting soon). On the other hand,\nDr. Beavis mentioned a current patient who is doing very well on Taxol after a *year.*\nFurther, she added, ovarian cancer is notoriously \"unpredictable.\"\nSo...much...uncertainty.\nDr. Beavis (who had conferred with Dr. Patel) presented me with three treatment\noptions: 1)weekly Taxol (this is one of the drugs with which  I was treated initially),\nadministered here. Average effectiveness rate in maintaining cancer at current level or\nshrinking it: 30-35%. I am now 'platinum resistant' so drugs like cisplatin will no longer\nwork for me.\n2)Taxol (infusion) + Fostamatinib (a type of inhibitor in pill form), administered as part of\na clinical trial conducted by Hopkins. What I gathered is that this would involve weekly\ntrips to Hopkins for the first month or so; after that, Dr. Patel could administer the Taxol\nhere while I would be supplied with the pills to take. As this is a clinical trial, there is no\ndata on effectiveness; it would be a leap of faith. The treatment would not make me any\n*worse* off than treatment 1, and might yield a better result. The complicating issue\nrelates to logistics, travel to/from Baltimore, especially when fatigued etc.\n3)Taxol + Avastin (potential success rate in containing or reducing cancer = 50%). There\n                       828 / 1.901\nis a low (4-5%) risk of a very bad side effect with Avastin: an unfixable bowel perforation.\nIf that happens, per Dr. Beavis, it can be \"life threatening.\" She has seen such a case\nbefore and it was basically \"game over.\" I think we've all decided that this option should\nbe 'back pocketed' until the number of acceptable treatment options becomes slimmer.\nI had a productive meeting with Dr. Patel this morning as well. He went over the scan\nresults, examined me, and discussed the options. By the time I saw him, I had already\ndetermined that I was leaning towards the trial. I can make the logistics work (one option\nwould be to base myself in NY during the period of weekly commutes to Baltimore).\nGiven this, I want to go for the potentially more hopeful option. Tomorrow I will speak by\nphone with a Hopkins nurse associated with the trial who will answer all my questions.\nMy main concern is that the trial might end before I have to a chance to (potentially)\nbenefit from it (although no one has said for sure that this might be the case); it's been\nrunning for two years already and once a certain number of patients (subjects?) are\nenrolled, the trial may end. However, I was sent the consent form today and Dr. Beavis\npresented this trial as a viable option, so I'm crossing my fingers that it will be. She left\nthe choice between options 1) and 2) up to me. Dr. Patel recommends the trial.\nOn Taxol, I will lose my hair again (time for a new wig and more cute hats/caps), my\nneuropathy will probably worsen (perhaps my fingers will be affected, which would be a\ndrag), and I'll be fatigued (the fatigue the first time around was acute, but maybe it\nwon't be as bad this time).\nPlease disabuse yourselves of the idea that my cancer may go into permanent remission\nor even 'be cured.' It won't (how long does Willa have left -- a new parlor game?).\nOvarian cancer in Dr. Beavis' words is \"insidious.\" Did you know that cancer cells can\ngenerate new blood vessels to feed off?? I didn't. If that isn't insidious I don't know what\nis.\nPlease don't feel sorry for me, as I don't feel sorry for myself. Well, maybe on occasion I\nhave moments of nearly unbearable FOMO. But they are matched by swells of immense\ngratitude, and a weird yet fleeting *liberating* feeling after speaking with Dr. Beavis and\nrealizing that I'll have time to organize and orchestrate this next chapter, in all respects.\nAnd I look forward to more fun, creativity, time with loved ones, giggles. At least that's\nhow I'm feeling today. \nI do feel a need to create a safe, calm, protective bubble around myself. This is why I\nmay undertake some 'triaging' of thoughts, sights, acquaintances etc. that are inimical in\nrelation to this goal.\nI am incredibly grateful for my medical team. And for my State College support team,\nand wonderful friends and family near and far. I told Dr. Beavis that I always feel better\nafter speaking with her. She, in turn, told me that she always feels better after speaking\n                       829 / 1.901\nwith *me.* Amazing!\nThis post may be rather disjointed, reflecting my state right now. My mind has been\nracing and it's hard to turn it off. I have a lot to figure out. Was hoping to spend the\nweekend at my brother and family's country home in the Catskills but will now take a\nrain check (perhaps literally as a rainy weekend is in store, which may thwart my fall\nfoliage oohing and aahing ambitions) for a hopefully not far removed weekend. \nSo I'm on the 'narrow bridge' again. And the most important thing, per Rabbi Nachman of\nBreslau, is *not to give in to one's despair.*",

Rabbi Breslav.\nSpeaking as someone who risks falling a great deal owing to a spinal problem, as long as\nI see I have such bannisters to cling to, I don't fall as much - if at all. Unlike those who\nsnickered at Trump tilting forward as he descended the ramp from the plane, I thought it\nwas courageous to even try considering there were NO handrails.\nOption II? Yes! You have strong bannisters for both hands. You'll surely cross this bridge\nsafely as long as you dare! Hold tight, girl, and resist the temptation to look down. Step\nby step, holding tight, you WILL make this new journey - saving yourself for whatever\nbreakthroughs await she who refuses to hold back. The longer you hang on, the more\ntime there is for discovery.\n                       830 / 1.901\n(I remember my mother being given Avastin decades ago, when it. was only approved\nfor breast cancer - she had wet macular degeneration. Experimentally, accepting those\ninjections in the orbs of her eyes, she remained able to paint until fairly recently - many\nyears after her WMD peers had long become completely blind. And FWIW that was\nbecause Avastin, famous already as the great blood vessel blocker, stopped the growth\nof the capillaries determined to blind her.)\nWho knows what may unexpectedly lie around the corner for you too, granting you\nreprieves as yet unimagined?\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, October 7, 2021  \nSending love, Willa!\n  \u2014Nancy Locke, October 7, 2021  \nSo many challenges! thoughts are with you as you re-balance on that bridge.\n  \u2014Christopher Walker, October 7, 2021  \nYour insights are grounded and your heart is full.

    "entry": "Here's as much of an update as I can muster (or muddle through) at present:\n1)I've decided to opt for the clinical trial at Hopkins, which is the most *potentially*\npromising option, although it's also entirely possible that I'll see no benefits from the\ntreatment. I'm banking on 30-35% odds, from what I've been told.\n2)*If* Aetna authorizes my claim, next Thursday I will be at Hopkins for a)blood work (I\nthink?); b)a physical with Dr. Beavis; c)and an EKG (?). This physical screening is a\nprelude to treatment starting the following week. While the nurse working with patients\nenrolled in the trial conveyed to me that my claim was 'pending,' when I called Aetna\n(think phone trees, recordings, long stretches of Muzak etc.), I was told that they had no\nrecord of a claim being filed on my behalf. It turns out that Dr. Beavis needs/needed to\nsubmit her signed notes on my case to Aetna. I very much hope she did so today. That\nwill leave a mere few days for Aetna to review my claim. If I don't receive authorization\nby Wednesday, everything will have to be pushed back a week, meaning I will have gone\nwithout treatment for seven weeks, a stressful prospect (and I have a feeling those\nsneaky cancer cells draw some hidden power from my stress). I have no reason at this\npoint to think Aetna will not authorize my claim (the part not covered by Hopkins in the\ncontext of a clinical trial). I just hope it happens soon.\n3)*If* Aetna authorizes my claim, I will start treatment the following week, the 27th/28th.\nOn the 27th I will have a needle biopsy of one of my tumors, as I agreed to participate in\n                       832 / 1.901\na second study in which tumors are being studied to assess which treatments are most\nor least effective for specific tumors. Someone must be with me to accompany me after\nthe biopsy. On the 28th I will have treatment. I have no idea what I'll feel like afterwards,\nwhat side effects may hit me etc. One uncertainty among many.\n4)I spent about an hour on the phone with a lovely sounding nurse, Justin, who will be my\n'nurse coordinator' for the duration of the trial. He (re)convinced me that the nurses at\nHopkins are gems. I spent another hour on the phone with another nurse who set up my\nbiopsy, did some intake, and answered my questions. And I spent more time on the\nphone with the housing coordinator at Hopkins, who provided info about longer-term\nhousing options. Joanne's affect was nurturing and caring (but also no-nonsense) and we\n'hit it off' as well as one can with a stranger during a short phone call. We had both\nreceived the COVID booster the day before and were suffering through flu-like symptoms\n(awful in my case, but that's another story). She made me *promise* her that I would\nhave a caregiver with me during each of my trips to Hopkins. She also said I sounded\nstressed (on point there) and made me promise her that I'd lie on the couch and relax\nwith a cup of tea once i got off the phone with her.\n5)PA, MD or NY? Logistics, logistics. I'm still muddling through where to base myself\nduring the month when I'll be making weekly trips to Hopkins (after that it will be\nmonthly trips). Per one of my personal mantras: \"Everything in life is a tradeoff,\" in this\ncase  between comfort and convenience. I've more or less ruled out State College,\nexcept for the next two weeks, because it's a four-hour drive from Baltimore, the\nweather may start to turn rough next month (especially through those last miles of\nmountain passes), and I can't predict how I'll feel/if I'll feel up to driving after treatment.\nWhile Baltimore makes a lot of sense in terms of convenience (and a few people whose\nopinions I trust are lobbying for that option), I'm leaning towards NY and my network of\nbeloved family and friends there. I have an image of myself alone in a hotel room in\nBaltimore, should I spend the month there, sort of withering emotionally because cut off\nfrom 'my people.' I really don't do well in that type of situation (although a few kindly\nsouls might decide to come visit me). In any event, every week I will need most likely\nneed to spend one night in Baltimore because of the way the appointments will be set\nup. If it happens in any given week that I simply feel too tired to return to NY, I can\nalways stay overnight at my trusted Residence Inn John Hopkins Medical Center, where I\nhave stayed many times. Hopkins has some longer-term housing options for people\nreceiving ongoing care at Hopkins, but there are some restrictions that I may not meet.\nAlso, I had wanted to be in NY in Nov. for a few compelling reasons: my friend Mitchel's\nvisit from France; my friend Laurent's photography show opening; two exhibits at the\nJewish Museum, seeing other friends and family members. I have no idea how energetic\n-- or not -- I'll feel, but ideally I'd like to try to be available for these occasions. On the\nother hand, I am hoping to attend a family bar-mitzvah in Baltimore on Nov. 18th..\n                       833 / 1.901\nIsn't this simply thrilling?!? I'd much rather be sitting poolside on an an island drinking a\ncocktail, enjoying a caf\u00e9 cr\u00eame in Paris (or doing just about anything else) but here we\nare... and I will feel *very* grateful for the insurance hurdle to be cleared and for\ntreatment at Hopkins to start.\nSo here's my pitch: *if* I am indeed based in NY and in weekly treatment at Hopkins in\nNovember, would any of my NY pals or fam be up to making a trip (likely involving an\novernight, *maybe* even two but more likely one -- a Th/Fr, a W/Th, or a W/Th/Fr) with\nme? Given that I'll be receiving Taxol (aka the Red Devil) and also given the lovely side\neffects I might expect (diarrhea, neuropathy, etc.), I am somewhat wary of making the\ntrip alone. I am happy to cover all expenses and hopefully there'd be some giggles along\nthe way. I was very touched today when my ex-brother-in-law (w/whom I had lunch\nduring his visit with Michael) offered to accompany me to B'more if it meshes with his\nschedule (Thursday is apparently a good day for him). I know that many of you might like\nto, but have other commitments and of course I understand that (so no need to respond\nin that case). I'd be most interested in hearing, instead, from those of you for whom this\nmight actually be feasible. I know I can count on my mother one week (thank you,\nMom!).\nMeanwhile, I am doing ok moodwise, keeping busy, enjoying time with friends, taking\ndrives, working on an article I feel good about (plus a book review + a book manuscript\nevaluation). That's the best medicine for me. Bought a blingy green ring at an antiques\nstore. Enjoyed a Latin Festival downtown with my friend Clare, Went to an outstanding\nconcert with my friend Jackie by a choral group I adore, Voces8. Please listen to\n\"Timshel\" below and understand why I appreciate this song of comfort. Thank you, John,\nfor the very last rhubarb of the season (in October!!), Michael for the carrots, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte\nfor the sweets and the magnificent vintage Whitman's chocolate tin adorned with\nMucha's Sarah Bernhardt, Heather B. for your handwritten notes, Jeff for the catch-up\ncall,  Julie for the long overdue catch-up Zoom, Scott for the yummy chili, and many\nothers for texts, emails and calls of concern. \"In spite of everything, I still believe that\npeople are really good at heart.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbMFhW-y1Ew",

    "entry": "Greetings from Baltimore.\nMy 'teal sister' Rhonda Gold, whom I never met but knew only through social media as\nan OC survivor treated at Hopkins, died a day or two ago, in her late sixties, after a six or\nseven year bout with OC. I've been wearing the pendant Rhonda sent me bearing the\ncancer bow, two teal colored stones, and the words \"Chazak ve'ematz\" (\"Be strong and\nof good courage\"), from the Book of Joshua. Someone had given it to her one Rosh\nHashanah and she entrusted it to me, as I hope to entrust it, eventually, to another OC\nsurvivor. I wish I had met her. She seemed like an extraordinary, vibrant woman, like me\nmost 'afilliative' (to use a word my therapist sometimes uses to describe me). On her\n                       836 / 1.901\nFacebook page today, a quote from the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi: \"Goodbyes are\nonly for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul\nthere is no such thing as separation.\"\nI'm in Baltimore for a few physical screening appointments prior to my first treatment\nnext week (I hope) as part of a clinical trial at Hopkins. This being said, Hopkins appears\nto have been very late submitting the precertification request to my insurance company\nso it hasn't been approved yet (frankly, I don't even know if it's even been submitted).\nAetna needs to clear everything by next Wednesday, when I have a biopsy (I agreed to\nenroll in a second study that involves studying tumor samples). Aggravation.\nLet me apologize off the bat to those whom I might have 'left hanging' as I try to work\nout complicated logistics for the next month, when I'll be travelling to Baltimore once a\nweek for treatment, most likely from New York. My focus has been on getting the first\none or two weeks set up (a complicated endeavor in itself) but I promise to be in touch\nasap with those most generous family members and friends who have offered rides,\naccompaniment to Baltimore, housing, and meals/errands/miscellaneous. Much as I\ntreasure my independence, I unfortunately can't make the next month (or more) work\nwithout help, so I am extremely grateful for the generous responses. Thank you.\nI also owe some emails and will try to get back to everyone asap!\nPlans, plans, plans. Plans will keep me busy this next month. And busy-ness is a bulwark\nagainst anxiety, depression, and worry. Dr. Beavis said: \"I can't give you a cure, but I can\ngive you a plan.\" So I grasp at plans and their myriad components, hopefully. \"These\nfragments I have shored against my ruins.\"\nI am feeling ok, with some slight discomfort in my abdomen/pelvic area and back. I am\nvery eager to begin treatment before my cancer has any more time to grow/spread, and\nequally eager to assess whether treatment is working as soon after that as possible. If\nit's not, we're on to the next plan. That *might* be a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan-\nKettering, if they can offer me a potentially (more) effective treatment or trial. Since I\nwill spend most of November in NY, Dr. Beavis suggested I schedule a consult there,\nwhich I find a great idea. She has already sent a gyn onc surgeon she deems 'terrific' my\ninformation and I hope to contact her asap. I'll see Dr. Beavis tomorrow and she can\nadvise.\nI had such a pleasant drive down here. It's really not arduous at all: perhaps 3.5 hours\ndriving time. A gorgeous fall day with the foliage colors becoming deeper, more vibrant\nand varied the further south I drove. I stopped for lunch at Alvaro's (alvarobread.com), a\n'real deal' Italian bakery that has long been my midway point/pit stop between State\nCollege and Baltimore/DC. It's a small place on a corner in the historical downtown area\nof Harrisburg (which I think they call 'Uptown?'), casual, full of state government\n                       837 / 1.901\nemployees and locals who appear to be regular customers. A few tables with umbrellas\noutside. The 'nonna' holds down the fort in the kitchen, producing the mouth-watering\ndaily specials; I dug into delicious soft meatballs in sauce with a side of homemade bread\nthat I dipped in the sauce, then bought stuffed shells and sausage to take with me for\ndinner tonight, along with a hefty portion of pastries (a cannoli, an eclair, a mini\nsfogliatelle and a few cookies). It is always shocking to see the housing inequities in\nHarrisburg (and of course Baltimore, much of it right near the JH Medical Center), block\nupon block of dilapidated houses along with lovely renovated Victorians and a glistening\nSusquehanna waterfront.\nI'm back at my 'home away from home' here in Baltimore: the Marriott Residence Inn\nJohns Hopkins Medical Center, where I've stayed many times. Many JHMC patients stay\nhere and the staff is kindly, the rooms ultra-clean and quiet, the free breakfast copious.\nThe top floor restaurant with the great view (my friend Sandy, mom, Ethan and Ben will\nremember it) apparently did not survive the pandemic, but I ordered a small salad from\nthe bar downstairs. While I'd prefer not to remember some of my previous post-surgery\nor post-procedure visits here, tonight I am feeling strong physically and mentally, ready\nto move forward. I continue to be blessed to \"walk with good companions.\"\nIf all goes as planned, I'll drive back to State College tomorrow and can't wait to hug Ben\nand Sammi, who will be arriving for the weekend on Friday. I'll return here next Tuesday\nfor my biopsy Wednesday morning and treatment and other appointments on Thursday.\nAs promised, I will be in touch asap (certainly once I return to SC) with the kind\nfriends/family members who have offered me rides to/from Baltimore as well as help 'on\nthe ground' (I must have a 'caregiver' with me for the biopsy and likely for treatment as\nwell). Then back to SC for  a few days before driving to New York with my friend Deb, to\nstay until.... Thanksgiving? That's the tentative plan, although it's always possible I may\nonly go so far with the trial if it doesn't prove effective. If I have adverse side effects,\nmoreover, it is also possible, that we might stop the trial for a week or two and then\nrestart. So...much...uncertainty. But in the meantime....plans!\nGo figure that just as my cancer progresses my social/friend life in SC starts to get\ninteresting, maybe more interesting than it's been in years as I always felt that my 'real'\nfriends were elsewhere -- in NY, or Paris, or Boston etc. But the past months and, I\nsuppose, 2.5 years have brought some wonderful people into my PA life and have helped\nsolidify existing friendships. Wonder if that's coincidence -- or not (I think not). A jaunt to\nDuncansville PA along gorgeous backroads with my 'antiquing posse' was lots of fun last\nweekend, as was a visit from and great convo w/Mark, a State College friend who moved\nto Cali, as was Thai take-out lunch in a cute park in Lemont w/my friend Maria, as was\ndinner with three smart, stylish, kind women friends, Kathryn, Cheryl and Sandy (a Paris\ntrip was discussed....), as was a long catch-up visit with my friend/colleague Benedicte\n(don't have my 'accent-friendly' keyboard with me), who brought me a vintage Witman's\ncandy box adorned with a Mucha image of Sarah Bernhardt -- which B. had loaded up\n                       838 / 1.901\nwith all sorts of sweet treats (VIchy pastilles and such) from France. Looking forward to\n(her) bday lunch w/my friend Helen on Monday. And did I mention lunch outdoors at the\nAle House, in the mellow sunshine, w/ex-bro in law Bruce?\nI'm a lucky girl. :)\nPhotos\n                       839 / 1.901\n                       840 / 1.901\n                       841 / 1.901\n                       842 / 1.901",

    "entry": "846 / 1.901\n                       847 / 1.901\nJust a quick update: I am back in Baltimore to begin treatment this week, if all goes as\nplanned. My main hopes for the coming weeks are that a)the treatment is effective in\nstabilizing or reversing my cancer growth (this will likely only be ascertained in eight\nweeks, when I have a scan, provided I do well in the trial>see b] and c]); b)the side\neffects of the treatment are not too harsh, debilitating, and potentially irreversible (I'll be\nmonitored very closely here); and c)related to b]: I can withstand the side effects without\nundue delays in my treatment.\nI think I'm 'just' anxious. I've never participated in a clinical trial, never had chemo\nadministered at Hopkins, never done this weekly commuting thing, never had my\ntreatment become *such* a full-time job, never met any of the staff associated with the\ntrial etc. The presence, physical or virtual, of 'good companions' (angels?) helps\nimmensely.\nMy friend Sandy and I gabbed for 3.5 hours in the car to Baltimore, so the trip went very\nquickly. We reminisced about two previous times she drove me to Baltimore, including\nour getting lost trying to find a lunch spot in/near Harrisburg and winding up at a very\nstrange sandwich shop (\"Sandwich Man\") on the outskirts of the capital that was pretty\nmuch a dump but that had very attractive, Maxfield Parrish-type prints on the wall in\nbeautiful frames -- a weird contrast!\nI loaded up a Zabar's freezer bag with food this morning to tide me over for my three\nnights here. As I mentioned in a previous blog, the hotel restaurant closed as did my\nother go-to place around the corner, Atwater's. The neighborhood's sketchy and I don't\nfeel like going farther afield, although I've discovered a few good restaurants during my\nprevious trips.  I can't eat anything past 5:45 tomorrow morning in preparation for my\nbiopsy, to which my college friend David will escort me, picking me up after the\nprocedure (he's also 'on duty' on Thursday). Despite (because of?) the circumstances, I\nam looking forward to seeing him! He nicely came to visit me in the hospital after my big\ndebulking surgery in May 2019. \nNurse Justin left me a voicemail this afternoon to let me know that Aetna has approved\ncoverage of my treatment at Hopkins - phew.\nI'm comfortable in my 'home away from home,' the Marriott Residence Inn Johns Hopkins\nMedical Center. The staff is especially kindly as many of their guests are Hopkins\npatients. Although there always seem to be a few things awry (today: no tv remote, no\nmakeup remover wipes, no antiseptic wipes), the rooms are clean and quiet, and I'm\ncomfortable here.\nIt was wonderful to see Ben and Sammi this past weekend, albeit somewhat briefly (I'll\n                       848 / 1.901\nsee them soon in NY). Michael grilled hamburgers and hot dogs for us on Saturday night,\nan annual tradition. The kids came for brunch on Sunday and helped me with a few\nthings. They went to the football game on Saturday; there were multiple overtimes and\napparently PSU played miserably. I listened to a few mn of the game on the radio, while\ndriving around the countryside looking for fresh apple cider and maple syrup (both of\nwhich I found).\nThanks to the 'angels' who sent me texts this a.m. w/well wishes. I appreciated the\nsendoff. \nI'll end with a video of Dr. Beavis, whom I write so much about. She lived in England until\nshe was twelve, and has retained a slight British accent. I won't see her this trip but will\nbe examined by the oncologist running the clinical trial, Dr. Stephanie Gaillard (I believe\nshe is French, or of French heritage! We'll soon find out).\nDr. Anna Beavis | Gynecologic Oncologist - YouTube",

    "entry": "851 / 1.901\n                       852 / 1.901\nToday felt a bit 'unproductive' as the biopsy I was scheduled to have as part of a second\nclinical trial did not go forward as planned. The nodule that was to be biopsied,\npinpointed on both a sonogram and then another type of scan to get a better view, was\ntoo small to be useful (of course, I was not unhappy to learn about its small size!). There\nare other nodules/tumors in my abdominal/pelvic area, but their location was too\nproblematic to be of use: one is right near my bowel (which makes me anxious), another\nnear 'surgical clips' placed during one of my surgeries. While I appreciated the prospect\nof helping other women, even myself, by contributing cancerous tissue to this clinical\ntrial (to be injected into mice along with different types of anti-cancer medications), I\nwas also extremely relieved that the interventional radiologists were not about to take\nany chances trying to perform a needle or core biopsy on me. As the no-nonsense, fifty-\nsomething woman radiologist reminded me, in an appealing accent of some sort\n(Iranian?): \"First do no harm. That is our guiding principle.\" She explained that\nproceeding would not be \"productive,\" as the team would not be able to obtain the\nneeded sample; this does happen sometimes. Thank you, Hopkins radiologists, for not\nrisking my health by jabbing at a cm or so large nodule or risking a biopsy near a\nsensitive organ. And this type of wise, skilled care is why I make seven hour round trips\nto be treated by the world-class physicians at JHMC!\nIn the context of my visit, it's more important to me, though, that my actual treatment,\nscheduled for tomorrow, go well: four appointments beginning at 7:45 (!). I feel\nsomewhat anxious. Fingers crossed.\nThe day was salvaged by spending time with my college friend David, who nicely came\nand met me at the Residence Inn, waited (briefly, it turned out) while I was prepped for\nthe biopsy, and then walked me back to the hotel after we had coffee (and, for me, the\nfirst meal of the day as I was off food and drink as of 5:45 this morning). We had such a\nnice conversation that ranged over his interesting family history (a great-grandfather\nwho was an artist of note in Spain, whose fortunes were buffeted by both the Spanish-\nAmerican War and the Spanish Civil War, which led him to time in Paris), Harvard\nreminiscences, retirement plans, work, family, COVID, Baltimore and more. We have\nknown each other since we were eighteen! I found his presence comforting; a clinical\npsychologist by training, he's a kind, empathic, and steady person. He may meet me\nagain tomorrow if I feel I need a shoulder to lean on returning to my hotel after a day of\ntreatment -- I may, though, be able to get an Uber or even walk if I feel up to it. I have no\nidea how I'll feel, but fatigued is a safe bet.\nI rested for a while when I returned to the hotel around 2 p.m. and then Ubered to a\ngreat Italian bakery (you may have picked up that I have a strange obsession with old\nschool Italian pastry shops), Vaccaro's, in Baltimore's Little Italy. I enjoyed a delicious\ncappuccino and bought a few cookies.

I'm tired from not\nsleeping well (nor much) the past two nights and, I suppose, from treatment today.\nThings went smoothly. I roused myself (with difficulty!) at 6:30, dressed, ate a banana\nand some cottage cheese, and walked to the Viragh Building (for outpatient procedures).\nIt was a lovely, mild, sunny autumn day and with all my comings and goings today I\nwalked well over a mile, maybe two. A super friendly, dapper man in a sharp gray suit,\nJesse, whom I might call the 'concierge' or 'maitre d'' or 'mayor' (as I heard others call\nhim - writing /w/out accents here) of Viragh greeted me, helped me check in at a kiosk,\nand pointed me towards my first appointment, telling me to 'keep up my smile' and to\n'have a great day.' Slightly hokey, but this cancer patient for one welcomed his affability.\nHe only confirms my belief that Hopkins staff members are almost universally awesome!\nI first went to the lab for blood work. This being my first day of treatment, I actually had\nmy blood drawn *four* times (and vital signs assessed several times as well), at 8, 10,\nnoon, and 3! I began to wonder if I'd have any blood left.... The tech, Kia, did not know\nwhether she should take the blood from my port or a vein in my arm so I called Justin\n(my chemo nurse) to ask him and he was able to instruct Kia. I was trying to put my\nfinger on my feeling/s being around so many very sick people, from skin and bones older\nfolks supporting themselves on walkers to patients w/oxygen tanks, to a floppy little girl\nbeing moved from a van into a wheelchair. So many feelings: empathy, camaraderie (ie\nthese are my people), smugness ('they look much sicker than I do'), awareness of\npossible denial (\"they look much sicker than I do, but my disease is advanced and\nmetastasizing, so who am I kidding?'), to fear ('this is what's coming??'). Approach.\nAvoidance.\nAfter the 8 a.m blood draw I walked back to my hotel to hang out until the next one at\n10, stopping at Starbuck's (the only gig in the area for decent coffee) for a cappuccino. I\nswitched out a few items in my dragonfly-covered tote bag, sent a few texts, rested for\nabout twenty minutes. I then returned to Viragh to have more blood drawn at 10. After\nthat, I headed upstairs to the 10th floor, where I met Justin to go over scheduling,\nprocedures and more. As I suspected from talking with him, he's extremely nice,\nanswered all my questions patiently, seemed knowledgeable, helpful and\naccommodating (eg he helped me switch a few appointment times that conflict with\nevents I have plans to attend in NY and Baltimore in November). He gave me my first\ndose of Fostaniparib (I'll take two pills twice a day, every day), along with a 'diary' in\nwhich to record each dose I take and any comments about side effects. He confirmed\nthat the two most prevalent possible side effects of this medication are diarrhea (could it\npossibly be worse than what I experience now?! Oh my...) and high blood pressure.\nImodium and blood pressure meds can help w/those symptoms.\n                       859 / 1.901\nDr. Gaillard came into the examination room while I was speaking with Justin. She's the\nmedical oncologist running the clinical trial and she was to examine me today as Dr.\nBeavis was too overloaded with patients. Another impressive physician: forties (?), full of\nenergy, friendly, smart (trained at Hopkins, then taught at Duke before returning to\nHopkins as an asst. prof) -- and French! She spells her first name 'the French way'\n(Stephanie w/the accent aigu over the first e); like Dr. Beavis, she spent part of her\nchildhood abroad, in France, as her dad is from Burgundy. Unlike Dr. Beavis, she did not\nretain a French accent. We exchanged some words in French for fun; she speaks fluently\nw/slightly (American-) accented French, which she also uses when she can with her son,\nLuc.\nShe told me a bit more about the trial. She explained the science behind it quite clearly,\nbut I'm so scientifically illiterate that it's still a bit challenging for me to understand. Even\nthough I've taken Taxol before and it lost its effectiveness eventually, taking it with the\nFostaniparib somehow 'resensitizes' the Taxol (Taxol produces a protein that Fosta acts\non directly - I think?), so that the Taxol should become newly effective for me (my\noncologist friend Steve Sherman could undoubtedly explain this better in layperson's\nterms). She stressed that the combo of the two drugs *may* be more effective than\ntaking Taxol alone (which has a 30% effectiveness rate) -- or it may not. Some women,\nshe told me, have done well on this trial (meaning that their cancer remained stable or\nshrunk), others did not. Not knowing in which camp I will fall really sucks (sorry, but\nthat's the word that seems most appropriate here), esp given the very significant time,\nenergy and monetary investment involved. A scan after eight weeks should offer some\nevidence of whether the treatment is working, provided I continue to tolerate the\ntreatment well. So.much.uncertainty. Must remain hopeful, or at least sanguine.\nI went down to the lobby after my appointments with Justin and Dr. Gaillard, sank into a\ncomfy chair, ate some curried chicken salad I had brought with me, sent a few texts and\nbegan reading a one-act, Pulitzer Prize winning play (1995) by Margaret Edson called\n_Wit,_ about a 50 yo English literature professor with advanced metastatic ovarian\ncancer (!). Am only about a third into it, but I like the way the playwright interweaves the\npoetry she has spent her life studying (such as Donne's sonnet \"Death be not Proud\")\nw/her treatment and the many issues it raises for her (one of her physicians happens to\nbe one of her former students, for example). It's thought-provoking, and I hope to gather\nsome ideas for the piece I've been contemplating creating.\nA chemo nurse called me to let me know that I could start my infusion early if I wished.\nSo I headed upstairs to the 6h floor around 1 p.m. or so. A newish nurse plus a more\nexperienced one took good care of me in a private chemo bay (a nice change from being\nin full view of at least ten other patients in the chemo room at Dr. Patel's, although I\ndon't really mind that). They administered, through my port, pre-meds (Benadryl, pepcid,\nTylenol?, and something else), followed by the Taxol, which ran for about an hour. There\nare many possible side effects so it's wait and see (right now I simply feel tired, but\n                       860 / 1.901\nthat's likely from the Benadryl; I fell asleep and when I awoke was disoriented, thinking it\nwas tomorrow morning already). The side effects usually accumulate the further one\nadvances into the treatment.\nBefore leaving Viragh, I wandered into the Meditation Room and flipped through some\nbooks about spirituality from various faiths and 'humanistic' perspectives. Then I just sat\nfor a while and tried to clear my mind. It's a small, spare room with chairs lining the\nwalls, which glow with a soft blue-green light. Peaceful. I want to contact Rhonda, the\nwonderful chaplain of the Kimmel Cancer Center at JH, whose visits brought me much\ncomfort after my operations. She's Methodist (I believe) but her perspective is\necumenical and her prayers always succeeded in articulating my own fears and hopes.\nIt is not lost on me that today I was supposed to be attending the nineteenth-century\nFrench studies conference about an hour away from here, in D.C., but instead I'm at\nHopkins receiving cancer treatment. I can think of many ways to rationalize this fact to\nalleviate my disappointment and maybe even depression over not seeing colleagues\nwho are friends, presenting my research and learning about theirs, organizing a \"Penn\nState dinner\" at an excellent restaurant as several of us often do, etc. but what seems\nmost helpful for me right now is simply to tell myself that 'this is what I'm doing right\nnow' and it's necessary. This mantra keeps me focused on the present at least and helps\nme direct my energy towards trying to stabilize my health, my priority right now. I'm\ncertainly bummed, though, but c'est la vie (lol).\nThe only dreams I remember from my stay here have been college-related (Harvard and\nPSU; me as a student, me as a professor): a)a dream involving a guy named Jonathan\nCahn, who I believe was in the class ahead of us, lived in Currier House, and was quite\ngood-looking and b)anxiety dream: I have to write an exam for my French culture/history\nclass on very short notice. I feel confident that I can cut corners, for example by cutting\nand pasting from some previous documents, but when I realize that this really won't be\npossible, and when I further realize that 1)I've focused nearly exclusively in the course\non World Wars I and II to the detriment of nearly everything else I was supposed to cover\nand 2)I may not even have shown up to many of the class sessions I was supposed to\nteach, I start to panic. During all of this, I'm also supposed to go to the office of a (real-\nlife) colleague in the English department, Carla M., but I can't find her office.\nBack to SC tomorrow with my friend Martina who is nicely driving down to pick me up (i\nlook forward to some giggles), then I'll have one day to pack for NY, leaving Sunday\nmorning. And this is what I'm doing right now...\nPhotos\n                       861 / 1.901\n                       862 / 1.901\n                       863 / 1.901",

    "entry": "865 / 1.901\n                       866 / 1.901\nThe last week has been a blur for me but \u2013 now that I\u2019ve procured a \u2018hotspot\u2019 from AT&T\nenabling me to access the internet from my cousin Claudia\u2019s place \u2013 I will try to recap as\nbest as possible.\nMy State College friend Deb kindly drove me to the city last Sunday \u2013 her husband Tony\nhad packed up some delicious smoked salmon sandwiches for us to enjoy along the way.\nWe chatted the whole time and the four++ hour drive zipped by; fortunately, traffic\nwasn\u2019t bad getting into the city. She dropped me at my mother\u2019s place and continued to\nher place in Chelsea.\nI actually don\u2019t remember much about what I did Monday-Wednesday (a blur, as\nmentioned, compounded by pretty awful insomnia, my mind working overtime like a\nmachine I can\u2019t turn off\u2026). I wrote a few letters of recommendation and caught up on\nemails. I met Ben briefly twice, once in Union Square, the second time when he helped\nme transport most of my stuff to Claudia and Jorn\u2019s loft on Wednesday. My mother and I\nwent out for thin-crust pizza at a great place in her neighborhood, Posto. We also took a\nwalk up to Kalustyan\u2019s, an iconic New York international store, where I bought some salt\n(they sell dozens of varieties of salt from all over the world) and my mother bought some\nhalvah (Israeli marble halvah, one of dozens of varieties they sell). We also went, in\n\u201cCurry Hill,\u201d to a wonderful store crammed full of clothing, home d\u00e9cor and much more\nfrom India. Somehow I had gotten hooked on the idea that a fitted quilted sleeveless\nreversible Indian vest w an attractive pattern would make a nice addition to my\nwardrobe, and I indeed found what I was looking for (I was enthralled by the beautiful\nshimmering wraps, skirts and jewelry that Indian women wear for their weddings in the\nmost gorgeous \u201cMonsoon Wedding\u201d colors but felt that it was best to simply admire\nthose items from a culturally appropriate distance!).\nEverything went smoothly at Hopkins on Thursday. I woke up at an ungodly early hour\n(for me) to catch an Uber to meet my brother, who kindly agreed to accompany me,\noutside the new Moynihan Station that is replacing (or enlarging?) Penn Station. After a\nfew sips of cappuccino, I perked up enough to notice how spectacular this station is,\nharking back to the grand 19th century stations of steel and glass but with a sleek,\nmodern, open, airy feel. Much less dreary-creepy than timeworn Penn Station. The train\nwas very comfortable, and I believe I dozed through a good part of the nearly three-hour\ntrip; when I awoke sunlight was glinting onto Chesapeake Bay. Ethan had packed up\nsome goodies from New York that supplemented my much more modest few items, and I\nwas grateful for the bagels w/cream cheese and smoked salmon and some yummy tuna\nsalad from Absolute Bagels on the UWS.\nWe Ubured to Hopkins where I first met with Dr. Beavis and Justin, the nurse \u2018assigned\u2019\nto me for the duration of the trial. He\u2019s an excellent nurse, totally focused on making\n                       867 / 1.901\nthings go as smoothly for me as possible. He always answers my emails within a few\nminutes, and is thorough, caring, and knowledgeable. Vitals checked, everything fine,\nfortunately no high blood pressure as anticipated with the Fostamatinib. Dr. Beavis\nbriefly examined me (lungs, mouth, abdomen/pelvis) to make sure I was \u2018good to go\u2019 for\ntreatment (apparently, I was). She issued new prescriptions for a few of my meds that\nwere running low; we talked about how to best deal with my insomnia and dehydration\ndue to diarrhea. We also discussed logistics for trying to get me in to see a gyn onc\nsurgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering for a consult. Dr. Beavis suggested this initially both\nas a \u2018foot in the door\u2019 measure if I were ever to need urgent care while in NY and as a\nway of assessing whether MSK might be running any promising trials for me down the\nroad. This is one of many points that have proved complicated in recent weeks (my\ninitial call to MSK, last week, was met with the news that I can\u2019t schedule a consult there\nuntil I complete my current trial at JHMC \u2013 this turns out not to be the case\u2026I think\u2026).\nThere have been more \u2018hiccups\u2019 than I can even count and I need to remain very\nproactive to stay on top of the myriad details involved in my care. I\u2019ll allude to some of\nthese hiccups here, but can\u2019t get into all of them in detail, including a dilemma about\nattending, in my immunocompromised state, an upcoming family bar-mitzvah in\nBaltimore at which numerous folks with whom I\u2019d love to visit will not have been\nvaccinated. I used to have a pillowcase depicting a cat from the Boynton comic trying to\njump over the moon \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 and the slogan: \u201cNothing in life is simple\u201d \u2013 an apt\nmotto for me these days\u2026\nI next went to the lab in another building to have bloodwork to determine whether I\ncould proceed with treatment. I had actually messed up semi-big time with this as I\nforgot that I was supposed to have the bloodwork done the day before, in New York (for\nsome reason this had totally slipped my mind). It turned out to be ok, simply delaying\ntreatment quite a bit until all the results of the bloodwork could be processed and my\nchemo meds ordered and mixed. I was mad at myself for this slip up. Fortunately, my\nblood counts were all sufficiently robust enough to not raise any red flags and I was able\nto proceed to treatment.\nTreatment lasted about 2.5-3 hours. A big blast of Benadryl made me quite groggy but\ndidn\u2019t put me to sleep and the Taxol (chemo) took an hour to administer. Ethan sat in the\nchemo room with me while I was attended to by two nurses, Sarah and Nicole. I think we\nfinished up about 5:30.\nOf course, I have no idea of whether the treatment is effective and will not know until I\nhave a scan \u2013 my hunch is that won\u2019t be until towards the end of the year. It is possible\nthat all this poison is being pumped into my body for no effect. As mentioned, Taxol has\nabout a 30-32% effectiveness rate, which may or may not be improved by the additional\nmed (Fostamatinib, a drug used for autoimmune conditions) that I am taking per my\nparticipation in the clinical trial. My last CA 125 number was 33, technically considered\n\u2018normal\u2019 (up to 35) but slightly high for me; it appears, though, that we are basically\n                       868 / 1.901\nditching this number as a barometer of my cancer, and instead going with the scans,\nwhich have proved more revealing. So it\u2019s wait and see. I can decide to leave the trial at\nany point but\u2026for what alternative? My current plan is to stick with the trial until a)my\ndoctors determine the treatment is not effective for me (ie cancer has progressed)\nand/or b)the side effects become unmanageable (so far they are manageable).\nAfter treatment I felt well enough to walk back to the hotel (1/3 mile), especially after\nhaving been cooped up all day. Somehow I was ravenously hungry, so I suggested to\nEthan that we Uber to an old school Italian restaurant I like a lot, La Scala. I was so\nhungry (or perhaps it was pent up energy making itself known) that I ate a hearty bowl\nof homemade spinach fettuccini with Bolognese sauce (delicious) preceded by half a\ngrilled Caesar salad and followed by a huge piece of tiramisu, my favorite dessert (I had\nsaid to the waiter, when he brought it over, \u201cI fear you may need to bring me a box for\nme to take half of this home.\u201d When he brought the box over: Guess what?). I apologize\nfor seeming gluttonous; I don\u2019t entirely understand the nature of the deep hunger I felt\nafter my day of treatment. Something is going on with that. All the uncertainty is\nperturbing and it is sometimes difficult for me to remain calm.\nIt was so nice to have time to catch up with Ethan over dinner and throughout the day,\nto trade news of our kids, our lives, to check in with each other. If the reason for my trip\nto Hopkins was sobering, I declared the opportunity to spend quality brother-sister time\ntogether \u201ceven fun!\u201d\nAs I mentioned in last week\u2019s blog, the quality of the service at our go-to hotel has\ndefinitely descended several notches. This time there were stains on the towels and\nbedding, sofa bed was not made up etc. They were likely hard hit during the pandemic.\nThe staff remains lovely. However, I am contemplating trying to make next week\u2019s trip in\none day, if possible.\nDid not sleep very well but Ethan had nicely gone to Starbuck\u2019s before I got up and had\nmy coffee waiting for me. Ubured to Penn Station, a pretty Beaux-Arts station from 1911\nthat would be a suitable movie set for a film set in that era. Return train very crowded\nw/weekenders and some likely NY marathoners.\nSomehow things decomposed once we arrived back in NY \u2013 nothing horrible but enough\nannoyances to precipitate a mini-meltdown on my part. The glorious November weather\ninvited walking, so I walked from 32nd and 7th to Claudia and Jorn\u2019s place on W. 15th.\nSomewhere along the way my right shoe began to chafe against my toe, sending searing\npain through my foot as I walked. I plunked my stuff down in the loft, then set out again\nto pick up the prescriptions Dr. Beavis had ordered from a CVS near my mother\u2019s\napartment (about ten blocks from the loft). I was also hurrying so that I could get to my\nmother\u2019s in time to have her help me bring the rest of my stuff, which I had left at her\nhouse, back to the loft with me. The CVS episode was an epic fail: apparently my\n                       869 / 1.901\ninsurance for medications was rejected and they couldn\u2019t fill my prescriptions (several of\nwhich have run out and I need them\u2026); I was able to buy potassium at full price (I will\nnot be able to do this w/the blood thinner Eliquis, which costs $500 without insurance). I\ncalled my CVS in State College to try to find out what was going on and could not get the\ninfo I needed; I\u2019ll need to make some more phone calls. Meanwhile, the pharmacy in NY\nwas very crowded and the pharmacists were both truly unpleasant, yelling at me in front\nof all the other customers! By that point I was in nearly full-blown meltdown and so I left\nthe store, forgetting to pick up the Benadryl I need to sleep (I stopped at another place a\nfew blocks away to pick that up, along with some toe guards to alleviate the searing pain\nin my foot). It was too late for my mother to help me so I packed up my remaining stuff\nin her apartment and took an Uber back to the loft, even though it\u2019s walking distance \u2013\nbetween my throbbing foot, my very heavy bag, and my fatigue I was spent! I ordered\nsome too-salty Udon soup via Door Dash, which did not help w/my dehydration.\nClaudia and Jorn\u2019s beautiful loft provides wonderful respite for me. Still, it took me\nforever to fall asleep last night but once I was out I slept soundly and late. Still felt some\n\u2018decrepitude\u2019 this morning \u2013 is my hair starting to fall out again? another inner mouth\nsore? \u2013 but tried to \u2018right\u2019 myself. My mother met me at Breads Bakery for coffee and\nrolls/pastries and then nicely accompanied me to AT&T to get my hotspot set up; to\nDSW, to buy myself some unattractive but comfortable and functional Sketchers to\nreplace the offending pair of shoes that wreaked havoc on my feet; and to the farmers\nmarket to buy a few healthy items to eat/cook the next few days (eggs, cheese, veggies,\nfruit). Union Square was bustling; I had rarely seen the farmers market and surrounding\nstores, restaurants, cafes etc. so lively and packed. New York is back? The grand\nweather and Marathon weekend fever certainly helped.\nThe next few days will be a mix of rest and seeing a few friends and relatives \u2013 an\nadvantage of being in the city. Looking forward to brunching w/my friend Shanny\ntomorrow. Will write more about plans for next Thursday\u2019s Hopkins jaunt soon. Despite\nthe preceding account (I feel sheepish for whining but needed to vent), the bottom line is\nthat I\u2019m feeling pretty much ok, well enough to plow through everything I\u2019ve just\ndescribed.\nThanks very much to everyone who has sent emails and texts of support from near and\nfar. Your words lift me up! Missing all my friends in State College. It is nice to spend\nsome time with dear ones in the city, though.

    "entry": "Recent dreams both take me back in time: 1) people (students) are sitting against the\nwall in the long hallway running through the apartment I grew up in, in Gramercy Park.\nThey are taking a math test or exam. I am supposed to take the test too, but don't have\nit in hand, and can't see anywhere to sit. I finally obtain the test and proceed into the\nlarge living room in our old apartment to find a seat; I'm the only one in the room.\nTrepidation about taking a test in math, a subject I'm notoriously bad at.\n2)Standing on a sidewalk watching a car go by, and realize that the driver is a very\nyoung (age 4-7) Ben! I am amazed/anxious to see him at the wheel of a car. I feel that I\nmust tell him that the age for procuring a driver's license is eighteen!\nThe past few days have had their stresses and frustrations -- [update: but things\nimproved as the week continued]. Thankfully, I am feeling pretty ok physically. I don't\nknow if it's even worth describing the insurance nightmare that engulfed me for three\ndays, sparked by my being banished from a CVS on 22nd st. twice because the mean\npharmacists said my insurance claim had been rejected, preventing me from buying two\nmedications I badly needed and that I had to forego taking for about five days. While I\npaid out of pocket for potassium and vitamin B12, Eliquis (blood thinner) costs $500 sans\ninsurance and Lexapro (anti-depressant) costs close to $60. Suffice to say I held off on\npurchasing both these meds. This problem, which of course I had to resolve one way or\nanother, set in motion about 20 (?) phone calls on my part to a)the medical insurance\ncompany (Aetna); b) the insurance company covering my prescriptions (Caremark/CVS);\nc)Lifetime Benefits Solutions (billing company for Aetna and Caremark) and d) Penn\nState Human Resources. A) would send me to b) would send me to c) would send me to\nd), like a ping pong ball, and being off my anti-depressant did not help during those mind-\nnumbing waits, navigation of phone trees etc., when I could practically hear the veins in\nmy temple and neck pulsing loudly. I believe the reps I spoke to truly wanted to help me,\nand were all pleasant, but it took a long time to untangle the different strands of the\nproblem (my insurance policy was listed as 'expired,' leaving me with no medical or\nprescription coverage).\nAgain without going into equally mind-numbing detail, it turned out that I had been\ndelinquent on payments to my insurance company (news to me; something about the\nmode of payment apparently changed when I retired and I didn't get the memo). So I\ncertainly accept responsibility for this and have now set up my post-retirement insurance\npolicy payments to be withdrawn directly from my bank. I am not positive, however,\nwhether it was my lack of payment that precipitated all my coverage being cancelled,\nbut it appears that this may have been the culprit. Once I paid up over the phone, to the\n                       877 / 1.901\nbilling company (which I did immediately, of course), I was able to get Penn State to\nreactivate both my medical insurance and prescription coverage, in concert with both\nAetna and Caremark. I *think* the medical part has been reinstated now as I once again\n'exist' as an entity on Aetna's website (ie my id card has reappeared there), and am\nwaiting for the prescription coverage to kick in again as well. [update: as of yesterday,\nthe entirety of my coverage has been reinstated! Cost for my Eliquis and Lexapro at\nHopkins pharmacy yesterday: $.0. Insurance doesn't cover the pricey mouthwash I will\ntake to deal with chemo induced mouth and tongue sores, but I'll cough up - no pun\nintended - $40 for the stuff].\nUpdate: I realize that as an American, I complain about insurance coverage from a\nposition of privilege. A dear friend who just lost her brother to cancer in Beirut, a city in a\ncountry in dire shape, reported that her family had to pay for his cancer care out of\npocket because of the country's financial/economic crisis. And even in this country so\nmany go without adequate insurance. I am extremely lucky to benefit from such\nexcellent care and more than adequate insurance coverage.\nThe second major 'pain' of the first part of the week revolved around my needing to have\nlabs drawn in the city, with the results to be faxed to Hopkins. I located a Quest\nDiagnostics lab near the loft; their claim to take appointments both by phone and on line\nbeing apparently false, I walked over there a few days ago to make sure that I could\nindeed have my blood drawn there. In reality, they only take walk ins. I returned there\nthe following day and waited for a very long time. The place looked dirty to me and did\nnot inspire confidence. When I inquired about whether they had a record of my having\nsigned in, the technician barked at me: \"Silverman? We called your name several times\nalready.\" The fact was that the technicians do not even enter the waiting room to call the\nnext client but simply announce the name barely audibly from a room around the corner\nfrom the waiting room. Oh well. Unfortunately, the technician either did not pinpoint my\nvein accurately and/or did not apply enough pressure after removing the needle. As soon\nas I left the lab and crossed the street, I felt something cold and wet leaking into my\njacket arm. I removed my jacket and saw blood covering the entire inside of the sleeve\nand seeping into my shirtsleeve as well. Somewhat panicked, I sat down on the ledge of\na shop, found a tissue in my bag and began applying pressure as blood continued to turn\nthe tissue red. This was my 'breaking point' and I began sobbing loudly as I tried to stop\nthe bleeding. Granted, I was five days off Lexapro, lacking sleep, and more 'unregulated'\nthan I suspected. Despite my sobs, the midday crowd on 22nd street surged blithely past\nme, engrossed in their cell phones; the only person who continued to stare at me with\nconcern as she walked by was a little girl. I flagged a uniformed man who looked like a\npolice offer (\"Are you an officer? Could you help me?\"). He turned out to be a traffic\nofficer but said he would get a police officer to come over. No one came. By this time, I\nhad calmed down a bit, stopped the bleeding, and headed into the store whose ledge I\nwas crumpled onto, which happened to be the large newish Harry Potter store where my\nniece works; I had intended to stop by to visit her after my blood draw. It was strange --\n                       878 / 1.901\nand probably helpful in some way -- to go from this awful experience into the alternate\nuniverse of Slytherin and Griffyndor, where you can buy a magician's wand for $38. The\ndesign of the shop is actually quite cool and it was packed. It took me quite a while to\nfind Eve -- it's a large, two-floor shop -- but eventually I located her in an attractive room\nwith Harry Potter wallpaper that sells graphic art inspired by the series. Fortunately she\nhad a bandaid on her and we were able to chat and have a co-worker of hers take\npictures of us in front of a faux fireplace. Despite my mood, it was lovely to see my dear\nniece and give her a hug.\nNothing in life is simple: the Boynton pillowcase I alluded to in a recent post features, of\ncourse, a *cow* trying unsuccessfully to jump over the moon, not a cat. Duh.\nThe second half of the week improved. I will post some pictures illustrating that\nstatement in a next post. \nMy Hopkins trip yesterday went smoothly. I decided to experiment with going and\ncoming in one day, and foregoing having someone accompany me on the trip, although\nmy former bro in law Bruce had kindly offered. A one-day trip is tiring, I found, but\nentirely feasible. I felt slightly 'befuddled' at times when I was there simply because it\nwas such a relatively rushed day but the entire staff is so unfailingly pleasant and\nprofessional that it put me in good spirits. Despite my early wake up time, I made it to\nMoynihan Station slightly after 7:30, had time to grab a Starbucks and make the 8:10\ntrain. It was a pretty day, the late autumn foliage glinted shades of bright orange and\nred, and the sight of houses with docks leading right onto Chesapeake Bay was lovely. In\nperhaps a last gasp from this 'week from hell,' I had an unnerving cabbie drive me to\nHopkins. He kept defending himself energetically and loudly from (my??? no!)\ninsinuations that he might be cheating me somehow, a strange stew of references to\nHoly Books, the fact that his parents raised him right, and a mind-numbing repetition of\nthe random phrase \"Experience is the best teacher.\" After telling me it was fine to pay\nby credit card, he somehow messed up my payment, and began chiding me for not going\nto a cash machine before getting into his cab (there is no cash machine in the station in\nBaltimore). Next time, I'll take an Uber; at this point, I think their drivers definitely have\nthe edge on the cabbie. Oh well.\nI arrived in ample time to have more blood drawn. As mentioned in a previous post, a\ndapper, emphatically friendly man named Jesse (photo next time?) greets patients in the\nlobby of Viragh Building and helps register them, printing off their itinerary if they need.\nHe remembered me from previous visits and told me to keep smiling (under my mask!).\nWe also compared the purples in our clothing. I told him I was a \"purple person\" and he\nthen showed me his amazing purple striped socks and classy, pointy, crisply polished\ndress shoes. My technician for the blood draw, Natasha, was also kind and friendly. We\ntalked about her twin daughters and how bored they are working and living in suburban\nPA (Lebanon). She expertly drew the blood from my port and set everything up for my\n                       879 / 1.901\nreceiving chemo through my port in the afternoon.\nWhen I finished in the phlebotomy lab, Justin (the nurse assigned to me for the duration\nof the trial) was waiting for me, as promised. As mentioned, Justin is an exceptionally\ngood nurse, completely on top of my care, efficient, kind, empathic. He shared the\nresults of the blood draw from Quest Diagnostic (thankfully, the lab did fax him the\nresults!), showing me which counts were slightly high or low. Fortunately, though, the\noverall picture remains good enough for me to continue treatment at this point. Justin\nthen directed me to the cafeteria (even telling me about an app allowing patients to find\ntheir way in the huge, and to me confusing labyrinth that is JHMC). He went off to attend\nto a few details of my care (I think?) and then met me at the cafeteria, where I was able\nto ask him some questions on the way to Dr. Beavis' office. He joined Dr. Beavis and me\nat her office, both of them collaborating on different aspects of my care (eg possibly\nlowering my dose of Fostamatinib if my bad diarrhea continues; coordinating the\nhandover of treatment beginning in December with Dr. Patel, with whom Justin had\nspoken by phone). I told Dr. Beavis that sometimes I can feel the tumors in my pelvic\narea ache when I wake up; she said this is normal but does not necessarily indicate\ngrowth, shrinkage etc.; the aching could be coming from the tumors or scar tissue, but I\ndefinitely feel them. I've been walking a lot in the city, and she encourages that. She\nexamined me briefly (chest/breathing, vitals, mouth, pelvis/abdomen) and nothing\nwarranted withholding treatment. I also told her (and Justin) -- thinking it superfluous but\nit actually is not, at all, as central to the question of quality of life -- that, providing I'm\nstill feeling up to it, I'd like to travel to my 'happy place' for a week or two, likely in\nJanuary, with a few fabulous women friends from State College. Dr. Beavis and Justin\nboth seemed supportive of that idea and can apparently work with me to tweak the\nschedule slightly if necessary. Dr. Beavis thought it was high time to think about booking\nplane tickets to Paris. So I need to get on this asap.\nIn the midst of my appointment i got a call from Caremark to say that any restrictions on\nmy prescription coverage had been lifted. Relief.\nJustin had also printed out a schedule for me going forward. Next Thursday I'll be at\nHopkins for blood work (collection of samples for the clinical trial, I will not have to\nretraumatize myself at Quest Diagnostics again this week) and to briefly be examined by\nDr. Beavis; I won't be having treatment that day (a scheduled break in the treatment\nafter three sessions). The following week I'll be off completely for Thanksgiving. I'll return\nto Hopkins, likely from State College, once in early December for bloodwork/Dr. Beavis or\nDr. Gaillard/treatment. After that, Dr. Patel will begin administering my treatment and I\nwill travel to Hopkins once a month to be examined and have a check in, blood draw etc.\nI will have a scan at the very end of December, which the Hopkins radiologists will\nanalyze. This will likely tell us a lot about the effectiveness - or not - of the treatment.\nAccordingly, my treatment plan may or may not need to be modified; it's likely, though,\nthat I'll at least start the third cycle of treatment in early January.\n                       880 / 1.901\nAfter meeting w/Dr. Beavis and Justin, I walked back to Viragh Building for treatment. My\ncollege friend David Miranda, who lives in Baltimore, had kindly reached out to me to see\nif I needed help 'on the ground,' as he had done the same for me two (?) weeks ago.\nWhile I was having treatment David - my 'care partner' for the day, in Hopkins' parlance\n(and he received the badge to prove it) -- picked up my prescriptions and a vanilla bean\nyogurt for me, and then returned to the treatment room where he found me loopy from\nbeing pumped full of Benadryl (it took me about 20 minutes to post a picture of Arnold\nmarching in the NYC Veterans Day parade in his original WWII uniform when normally it\nwould take me 5 minutes). Because I was groggy from the treatment (administered\nexpertly and compassionately by Nicole, an infusion room nurse), David accompanied\nme in an Uber back to Penn Station Baltimore, where I was able to exchange my ticket\nfor one on an earlier train. Once he made sure I was solid enough post-treatment we\nparted ways. What an angel and how pleasant it is to chat w/him and learn about each\nother's lives. I'm so grateful that we've reconnected, even under these circumstances.\nOne of the mini-silver linings. At the same time, I send prayers and healing wishes to\nanother classmate, Brenda, whom I never knew in college but whom I've met virtually in\nthe past year or so due to our common OC journey. Brenda is struggling right now. I\nhope her health improves.\nTrain was crowded back to the city around 5:40, but comfortable. A guy sitting behind\nme was coughing and incessantly blowing his nose for the first hour and a half, so much\nso that I inquired whether he was ok. After that his honking and blowing and coughing\nstopped and he launched into a very loud cell phone call (to whom??) during which he\nannounced that \"A fun fact about me is that I have nine brothers.\" Life can really suck\nsometimes, to paraphrase something my friend Shanny wrote a few of us the other day.\nFortunately, she noted, at other times it can be joyful and funny and absurd. QED.\nWill write a second post w/photos of some of the recent \"joyful and funny\" moments of\nthe past week.\nRereading my post, I realize that my 'mot du jour' appears to be \"mind-numbing.\" While\nit's a great word (imho), please know that the past week has not been *completely* mind-\nnumbing! Perhaps it's balanced by my other 'mot du jour' (which I know I overuse...):\n\"lovely.\" \n \n \n \n  \n                       881 / 1.901",

    "entry": "906 / 1.901\n                       907 / 1.901\nMy current treatment may be starting to become a harder slog for me. I feel tired, and\ntoday at least need to lie down for a while every two hours or so. Aching in my pelvis\nwoke me about 4 a.m. the other night (that 'witching hour' 'entre chien et loup'\n('between dog and wolf' when reputedly most suicides occur, a 'fun fact' that has\nremained lodged in my brain since a former therapist shared it with me); before I knew\nit, I was trying to settle myself by getting to \"Genius\" in the NYTimes \"Spelling Bee\" and\nreading through all the Sunday \"Vows\" accounts. I feel nauseous some mornings, usually\nresolved with an anti-nausea med, Compazine or Zofran.  I have awful diarrhea, which\nmay result in our having to reduce the amount of Fostamatinib (clinical trial med) I\nreceive each day, after we attempt to control it with another anti-diarrheal med aside\nfrom Immodium (of which I now take eight per day). I'm constantly battling dehydration.\nMy hair is falling out in handfuls, big clumps, for the second time. It took well over a year\nfor it to grow back. While Katherine, my trusted 'wig lady' in State College, has promised\nto make me look beautiful, I wonder how many times my body can regenerate in this\nway; I have in mind a poem about Ophelia, in French, by the Belgian Symbolist poet\nGeorges Rodenbach I believe, which describes Ophelia's hair disaggregating in the water\nand becoming one with the surrounding weeds, reeds, foliage, ferns and other plant life\nin a very natural way, all dissolving and melding into one organic swirl. I wish I could\nlocate that poem. The hair loss this time feels less traumatic than the first but perhaps\nmore agitating, exhausting (>the concern about the effort it will take to keep up my\nappearance, which somehow still matters to me as fairly central to my identity), 'here we\ngo again'-ing. I'm likely most concerned, actually, about not shedding hair around my\ncousin's apartment, so I've revived my collection of soft caps for the occasion (I even\nbrought my wig from State College, but it looks a bit timeworn). \nI often lie awake at all hours and worry about my cancer. What if the current treatment is\nnot working? What if I'm not among the lucky 30% -- maybe more with the added clinical\ntrial medication -- that will benefit from this treatment? What does the nausea mean, the\npelvic aches (they could mean something or nothing, according to Dr. Beavis), the\nfatigue? What risks do I run by perhaps letting my cancer go untreated for so long? What\nif errant cancer cells make a break for it, sneaking into my lungs or brain? \nOk, back to the mantra: \"One day at a time.\" Focus on the breathing. Listen to a guided\nYoga Nidra meditation on YouTube. Being surrounded by family and friends in NY the\npast few weeks has been grounding, a blessing. So comforting to text my mother in the\nlate morning and ask if she wants to meet at Breads Bakery in a half hour for coffee and\na croissant, before we pick up a few items at the farmers market; yesterday we walked\nthree miles around the Village, winding up at Veselka for delicious mushroom barley\nsoup (I took home equally delicious borscht for dinner). Lovely to have Ben drop by after\nhis classes are done. Calming to spend time with old friends.\n                       908 / 1.901\nI responded to a slew of emails today but have more to catch up on. I am so very\ngrateful for the emails, texts, voicemails, dream interpretations, gifts (thank you, Helen,\nfor the tea!). Please be patient with me while I do so. I often have the best intentions but\nthen become overcome with fatigue and need to lie down. Yesterday this turned into a\nfour-hour nap!\nPS: Despite my reference to the hour when most suicides occur, please know that I am at\nno risk of this! I might only consider this if I were to be in truly unbearable physical pain\n-- and I am nowhere *near* that point -- although I remain convinced that such pain can\nnowadays be managed with meds. I could certainly write more about this, but those who\nknow me well understand that I have a very strong spirit that is buoying me during this\ncancer journey. Moreover, I am eminently well surrounded by 'good companions.'",

I\u2019m glad the company of loved ones and of the city itself is\nbuoying you through this literal and figurative trial. Seems like making NYC your home\nbase for now was a great decision. I initially thought the poem you mentioned was by\nRimbaud but it\u2019s as you said - Oph\u00e9lie by Rodenbach.

A difficult moment indeed, but not the first and not the last,\nand in fact there have been far more difficult!

Your entry is surprisingly\nfree of anxiety though the facts are, of course, all there. But so are the honest, tender\nand humanized(?) details you describe so well. .It\u2019s simply about the actual living of it all,\nright now. I can\u2019t tell how much I\u2019ve wanted you to return to the city before now abd how\nglad I am that you have! Please know that the symptoms you describe are all\nattributable to the poisons that are determinedly at work attacking cancer cells. The GI\nlining cells turn over quite frequently and that makes them ready targets of chemo\ndrugs. They are unintended casualties and, not surprisingly, their upset shows up as\nnausea or pelvic area pain (which very well could be the lower parts of your intestines).\nPlease know the symptoms you feel are all perfectly expected results of a feisty chemo\nregimen making battle. Not to worry. And the fatigue is how drained your body is to keep\nup with the havoc the chemo is causing. They are poisons, my friend, as is needed.\nThough cutting down in the size could help the diarrhea and the fatigue that causes by\nkeeping you on the verge of dehydration. I\u2019m so happy you can meet your mother for\nRussian Jewish food! As for your hair, I can\u2019t imagine, but I do know how central that\nkeeping your beauty alive can feel. The drugs have different plans. And heck I\u2019ve come\nto learn, ones beauty can shine through without hair, too. It must feel dreadful and\ndiscouraging though. What an unpleasant process to see clumps of ones hair fall out.\nThat alone. Do know you are in my thoughts. \ufffd\ufffd Andrew\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, November 14, 2021  \nsending you love and strength as you encounter obstacle after obstacle in your journey.\nWe are all pulling for you!\n  \u2014Kory Olson, November 15, 2021  \nThank you, Kory! Around my house in State College I have several small statues of\n                       910 / 1.901\nthe Hindu deity Ganesh, remover of obstacles. I do hope that deity is with me!

    "entry": "911 / 1.901\n                       912 / 1.901\nYesterday I completed my fifth (I think??) consecutive trip to Baltimore in as many\nweeks, and the second in a row organized as a one-day round trip. As expected, it's been\na tiring proposition but overall it's gone smoothly, and my decision to make NY my home\nbase for the better part of the month was a good one.\nSame drill as last week: I awoke at 6:30 (preceded by a miserable sleep that had me\nwaking up *hourly*), ate half an almond croissant from Breads Bakery and some\ndelicious labne mixed with apricot jam from Kalustyan, threw a few items into a tote bag,\nUbered to Moynihan Train Hall, grabbed a cappuccino, and boarded the 8:10 train to\nBaltimore. The under three hour ride is easy and relaxing and pretty: I enjoyed seeing\nbig bodies of water (Chesapeake Bay) that are unknown to us in landlocked central PA. In\nPhilly, sculls were cutting ripples into the Schuylkill as they rowed by, as I observed from\nabove while we crossed a bridge. The late autumn reds and gold still abounded on this\nsunny day.\nUbured to the Viragh Building for my blood work (nice driver: we talked about benefits of\nlife in the country, where he wants to retire with his Black Labs, Jericho and Simon, v. the\ncity); all went according to plan. I showed the technician the hematoma now covering\nthe entire inside of my elbow, the mark of the technician at Quest Diagnostics in NY who\nnot only harmed me during  a blood draw gone wrong but, to add insult to injury, got\nangry with me for apparently not hearing her when she called (whispered?) my name\nwhen she was ready for me. The Hopkins technician/phlebotomist brought over a woman\nwho looked like a supervisor -- perhaps a physician, RN or more experienced\nphlebotomist. She examined my arm thoroughly, parsed the different parts of the wound\n(hematoma, adhesive burn, vein etc.), and recommended applying bacitracin and\ncovering loosely, scrupulously avoiding using that arm for any blood draws in the near\nfuture. She gave me all the supplies needed to care for/cover the wound. Although\nrelatively 'low hanging fruit,' this is precisely the type of expertise, thoroughness and\nsuperb patient care I have come to expect from Hopkins.\nI then had time for a very quick lunch in the cafeteria at Hopkins before my appointment\nwith Dr. Beavis. The massive medical complex still seems like a labyrinth to me and I use\nan app to navigate. At least I get some exercise walking from one end to the other.\nJustin met me at Dr. Beavis' with orders for my next blood draw. I had vitals taken (bp\nstill good!). I first met with Dr. Schneider, a fellow (?) working w/Dr. Beavis, then with\nboth Drs. Schneider and Beavis. Without going into graphic detail, I can share that some\nof the convo centered on peeing and pooping! Suffice to say that some of the\nmedications can prompt difficult side effects, paradoxically both diarrhea from hell and\nurinary *retention* (I wondered if this might be the result of a tumor pressing on the\nbladder but Dr. Beavis strongly suspects the medications and did not feel anything\n                       913 / 1.901\nduring her physical examination of me). Dr. Beavis is very skilled at tweaking the\ndosages of my meds and hopefully we'll get things sorted out. As an update, Justin called\nme this morning to tell me to hold the Fostamatinib (the drug I'm taking along with\nTaxol, as part of the trial) for two weeks, until my next appointment, as my neutrophil\ncount (white blood cells) is low; this is the recommendation of Dr. Gaillard, the medical\noncologist running the trial. It is not uncommon for dosages of meds to be reduced/\nincreased/stopped during treatment and Justin thinks I'll be likely to resume the\nFostamatinib in early December. Dr. Beavis and I briefly discussed a range of other\nissues, from sleep problems to a toenail that appears to be darkening and loosening\nfrom chemo to whether we should increase my Lexapro to help me cope w/the\nunderstandable anxiety that comes with being an ovarian cancer patient; on that note, I\nam very happy to have reconnected with Rhonda Cooper, the chaplain for the Kimmel\nCancer Center at JHMC, to whom I wrote a few days ago. Rhonda, a Methodist minister,\nprovided much comfort following my first operation; I found praying together for healing\nand strength, for myself and my loved ones, very powerful and I am looking forward to\nseeing her during my December trip to Hopkins. Dr. Beavis and her husband are loading\nup their bikes onto their car (they're both avid cyclists) and are off to celebrate the\nholiday with friends. We realized that the next time I see her it will be Chanukah (her\nhusband, Josh, is Jewish).\nI was finished before 2 p.m. so I Ubured back to Penn Station, Baltimore, and exchanged\nmy ticket for one for a train leaving an hour earlier; that one, however, was half an hour\nlate so my net time gain returning to the city was only half an hour! The train (w/a\nterminus in Boston) was quite crowded and seemed to be transporting many college\nstudents returning home for the holiday I am *so* glad not to be travelling for\nThanksgiving, as I'm returning to State College on Sunday, with Ben (Sammi will arrive\non Tuesday).\nI was very tired when I reached to the city but also hungry and, realizing I had little food\nin the apartment, spontaneously stopped in Koreatown to have some galbi (had a\ncraving for beef). The meat was tasty but also rather greasy; the sides were so-so; and\nthe soup wasn't good. I don't think I picked the best place, but it was ok. I also felt a bit\novercome by the throngs of people, the congestion and the noise, including that blaring\nfrom a huge Korean BBQ place on the corner of 32nd and 5th, called LOVE. I know this is\nhardly written \"like a true New Yorker\" but I'm realizing that there are certain\nneighborhoods in the city I have to avoid! I love the city of course and am at home here\nbut feel much more relaxed in more residential or mixed, 'throng-free' neighborhoods.\nI was so tired when I got back to the apartment, which I had left twelve hours earlier,\nthat I crawled into bed with a _People_ magazine. I experimented with no sleep meds at\nall and...guess what? I slept better than I had in quite a while. It wasn't perfect -- I fell\nasleep fairly quickly and only awoke about two times during the night -- but I am going to\ncontinue to further experiment with med-free sleep and better sleep 'hygiene.' To this\n                       914 / 1.901\nend, I thank my brother for the analgesic balm from China, in a lovely bottle to boot, that\nfeels relaxing when rubbed into the temples.\nMy stay in NY is winding down. My mother, Ethan and I shared a NY coffee shop lunch\nyesterday (fat tuna salad sandwich on rye toast + good fries); can't remember the last\ntime the three of us did *that.* Such a nice moment. Later that day, Ben popped over for\na visit and I enjoyed the added bonus of being able to briefly chat with my cousin Claudia\nin her apartment as I was returning and she leaving. I wish I had been able to spend\nmore time with her over the years but we're making up for lost time!\nA highlight of the week was also seeing my *grade school* friend, Sarah. It's safe to say\nwe have known each other for about 56 years, and we hadn't seen each other in at least\nten if not more! Since I graduated in a class of about (?) thirty women, I've remained\nclose or at least kept in touch with the majority of them. It's a blessed sisterhood. Sarah\n(who looks the same!) was kind enough to take the train in from her home in CT to have\na great Mexican lunch with me at Rosa Mexicano. As she works in an independent\nbookstore in New Canaan (Aunt Marlene, you must know it, on Elm St.?) and is an avid\nreader, she also recently sent me a book that I am looking forward to digging into soon.\nWe talked about everything including news of our classmates, memories of our\nclassmates' parents (the one who wore a fur coat; the one who smoked cigarettes from a\nlong holder; the one who smoked pot; the one who broke barriers for women in law\nschool) and our older and wiser perspectives on our Nightingale days. Sarah, who is now\na grandmother (!), seems to enjoy a wonderful life and I'm so happy for her. Sarah, Eva,\nJill, Jane, Zia and Lisa, thank you for reading my blog and especially for your friendship; if\nI've left anyone out *please* know that it's due to a senior moment and is not\nintentional!\nLooking forward to seeing a few more dear friends in the city before I leave on Sunday.\n \n \nPhotos\n                       915 / 1.901\n                       916 / 1.901\n                       917 / 1.901\n                       918 / 1.901",

    "entry": "920 / 1.901\n                       921 / 1.901\nI'm back in Baltimore for treatment (and other appointments) tomorrow, having driven\nhere from PA earlier (easy drive, with stop for lunch at Alvaro's in Harrisburg). After\ntomorrow, I'll be able to receive chemotherapy in State College, while travelling to\nBaltimore once a month (and not once a week) for a checkup. My next trip here is slated\nfor Dec. 30th (anyone wanna come with me?).\nI was hoping for my own private Chanukah 'miracle' -- perhaps like in a Hallmark movie\nor _A Christmas Carol_ or _It's a Wonderful Life_ -- where the 'spirit of the season'\nenvelops the main characters in goodness and light --when I finally got up the courage to\nlook at the results of my bloodwork from yesterday, and especially my Ca125 number.\nAlas, that number has more than doubled in the past two and a half months, jumping\nfrom 22.7 in September to 45.1 yesterday. I am almost certain that a result from\nOctober, though, was not recorded; as I recall, it was in the low 30s. Anything above 38\nis considered high. Even though Dr. Beavis has told me that we need to consider the\nabdominal/pelvic/chest scan (currently scheduled for Dec. 27th) as more\nrevelatory/predictive than the CA125 number, as any number of factors can distort that\nnumber (ovarian cancer marker), I can't help but feel bummed by this result, the highest\nsince August, when it hit about 51. Does the result suggest that the current course of\nchemo is not effective? And if so, what are the implications of that? Is this a preview of\nthe scan? Or should it be disregarded? Taken with a grain of salt? How do I interpret it in\nlight of feeling relatively well the past weeks and even months? Ovarian cancer can be\n*very* insidious. So...much...uncertainty. All I could do when I read the results (in my\nhotel room in Baltimore) was to clutch at the medallion the valiant Rhonda Gold gave me\n(\"Be strong and of good courage\"), feel the tears stinging in my eyes, and watch the\ncandles flicker in the little menorah I brought with me from home in order to be able to\nobey the commandment to light them.\nI'll be able to provide a more detailed medical update after tomorrow's appointments. My\nlist of questions is at the ready. I am looking forward to seeing Rhonda Cooper, the\nchaplain for the Kimmel Cancer Center, tomorrow morning. I contacted her a week or so\nago and will visit with her between my other meetings. My lovely college friend who lives\nin Baltimore, David Miranda, will reprise his role as my 'care person' during my infusion.\nHis presence is calming and comforting. As I'll be pumped full of Benadryl, he'll make\nsure I return to my hotel in one piece.\nMy cancer saga continues to unfold against a backdrop of truly lovely moments; perhaps\nI'm simply living out my priorities, as I've often said that if I knew (know??) that my life\nspan might be shorter than anticipated, I would definitely want to prioritize time with\nfamily and friends. My decision to spend most of November in NY while travelling weekly\nto Baltimore was definitely a good one, as I was able to alternate my treatments with\n'quality time' in the city. This included a fun tapas lunch at Boqueria Flatiron with my\n                       922 / 1.901\ncollege friends Denise and Mike Reiss and Richard Bashner and a heartwarming visit with\none of my dearest friends, Mitchel, on one of his annual visits to the States from France,\nwhere he now lives. Mitchel and I met in a class on Proust when I was a freshman (the\nonly one in the class!) and he was a sophomore. We became fast friends, in 1980\ntravelling all over Italy together (I remember wearing a shimmering red/pink-gold colored\njumpsuit while dancing to \"Funkytown\" in a disco in Florence...), then winding up as\naround the corner neighbors when he was in law school at NYU and I was at NYU's\nInstitute of French Studies, also for grad school. Even though we hadn't seen each other\nfor 2.5 years (the last time was in Paris, on my birthday, when Mitchel, our dear mutual\nfriend Randy, and I went out to dinner), we immediately started yapping away as if not a\nmoment had passed. It did me so much good to see him.\nAt the end of my NY stay, Ben arrived in a rental car and we drove back to PA (I always\nvalue those long car rides as rarely do I get to spend so much uninterrupted time with\nmy son!). Ben spent the entire week at home, and Sammi arrived a few days later.\nDespite how much I loved being back in the city, I appreciated the fresh air, quiet and\ncalm of my house, and was happy to be able to cook my own meals as well. Ben, Sammi\nand I spent several days cooking for our Thanksgiving celebration at Michael and Sue's.\nThat too was most pleasant, relaxing, celebratory and delicious, from the oysters, scallop\nceviche and Cava served as an appetizer to the tasty pecan and pumpkin pies Ben and\nSammi made (I contributed the crust) for dessert. I seem to be able to experience joy\nrather spontaneously these days -- compounding my natural disposition, which I'd say\ntends towards joie de vivre. Grateful for that.\nThe Saturday after Thanksgiving I greatly enjoyed a visit with the wonderful Christi, a\nformer grad student who has become a cherished friend. We went straight for the 'no\nb.s.' convo about survivorship, work, motherhood, families, spirituality and more. And as\nalways we shared lots of giggles too, especially remembering a rather burlesque\nexperience (or series of experiences) at a conference in Paris about ten years ago. Got a\npeek for Christi's husband, DJ, and her adorable (yet, that day, weary) seven-year-old,\nMisha.\nI have a new wig (see pictures). The 'Hair Lady' (per the name of her business),\nKatherine Fagan, a very nice woman a bit younger than me, knows how to make women\n(and men too I suppose) look good and feel attractive. I'm quite happy w/my new look. A\nsweet male student (I presume) came up to me in Starbucks the other day and\nexclaimed: \"I love your hair!\" [At the farmer's market in NY a week or so ago, when I was\nwearing my previous wig, a woman came up to me and said: \"You *must* tell me where\nyou get your hair cut! It looks terrific.\"]. Go figure.\nIf all goes as planned -- health? Omicron? - I am planning to go to Paris next month, for\ntwo weeks! This plan was hatched over a dinner or two with a group of fabulous women\nfriends in State College, all of whom work or have worked for the University. One of them\n                       923 / 1.901\nhas been taking French classes and would like to use her newfound language skills,\nanother vacations fairly regularly there with her husband, a third has never been but has\nbeen eager to go. All of them had suggested that it would be fun to go with me, given\nhow well I know the city as well as our common love of pretty things, good meals, wine\nand conversation, and much more. I invited my friend Helen to join me, Cheryl and\nSandy -- a fab foursome for sure. We (myself, C and S) will be staying in a hotel in the\nMarais, and will arrive just as the winter 'soldes' (sales) begin (!). There are a few\nexhibits I'm eager to see, including one at the Fondation Louis Vuitton showcasing the\nstellar collection of a famous Russian collector. I'm hoping that the second week, and\nmaybe a bit during the first, I'll be able to spend time with friends (Paris friends: I'll soon\ncontact you about this, but am being a bit cautious about not 'jinxing' my trip given\neverything I've written here). I have not been to Paris since March 2019, right before I\nwas diagnosed, when I took students there in the context of my course on France and\nthe Holocaust. I was supposed to return over the summer as a 60th bday present but\nwas recovering from debulking surgery and so Ben and Sammi went in my stead. I hope\nthat that scenario won't be repeated this time. Dr. Beavis has no objection and said that\nwe could shift things around for the two weeks I'm away. I realize that I will likely not be\nable to gallivant around Paris with my usual gusto, but I'm prepared to make some\nmodifications to my usual high-energy schedule. I get excited thinking about the\nprospect of returning to my 'happy place.' I even booked a seat, for the first time ever for\nme, in business class, ticking off one item on my very short bucket list.\n \n \n \nPhotos\n                       924 / 1.901\n                       925 / 1.901\n                       926 / 1.901\n                       927 / 1.901\n                       928 / 1.901\n                       929 / 1.901",

    "entry": "931 / 1.901\n                       932 / 1.901\nA brief update from Baltimore on today's appointment: after a week of improved sleep\n(all sleep meds eliminated in an attempted 'reset'), I slept (for a few hours) miserably\nlast night, my mind racing and spewing random thoughts, anxious about the following\nday's appointments.\nAwoke early, Ubured to Dr. Beavis' office for an 8:45 appointment for which she was over\nan hour late (good thing my next appointment wasn't until 10:30). A resident who works\nwith her, though, met with me beforehand and answered many of my questions. I always\nfeel that my meetings with Dr. Beavis go well, simply because she is so knowledgeable,\ntalented, compassionate, and capable of answering my questions thoroughly. Once she\nis with me, moreover, I have the sense that she is fully *there* and not looking at the\nclock or thinking about her next meeting. She sits close to me, fairly casually dressed\n(usually a dress from Boden over leggings because she bikes to/from work every day).\nShe did not seem overly concerned, at this point, about the rise in my CA 125 level. Even\nthough that level has been trending upwards the past two or three months or so, that\nperiod is marked by the start of my participation in the clinical trial. In other words, she\nstill thinks that it may take another cycle for the results of this new treatment to be\nreflected in the CA 125 number. Further, she noted that the increase has been 11 points\n(September to October), then 12 points (October to November). She'd be much more\nconcerned, she said, if she'd seen a more significant leap in the number (which can top\n1000; mine was well into the hundreds initially, if I remember correctly). The scan on\nDec. 27th, as I've mentioned, will be much more conclusive. She encouraged me, again,\nto try not to project too far ahead and to be fully in the moment, a goal she encouraged\nme, also again, to continue to pursue with my therapist (while she acknowledged its real\ndifficulty). \nI now have another short 'reprieve' until my scan on the 27th. I look forward to a low-key\nfew weeks.\nI asked her (and have also discussed at length with my therapist) what to make of the\nmany, many compliments I've been receiving lately on my outward appearance and\naffect, while knowing that I am battling incurable advanced metastatic cancer. I've\ndecided to simply accept these compliments graciously, while privately holding the\nknowledge that one can look and feel well and still be fighting an awful disease. My\napparently healthful-looking appearance is not necessarily a 'sign' that I may be winning\nthe fight. Nevertheless, as Dr. Beavis noted, if I were confronting the final stages of my\ndisease I would likely 'look sick' (thin, wan, weak etc.). Perhaps I'm simply outwardly\nembodying a mantra that my friend Isabelle recently coined: \"Less attitude and more\ngratitude\"  -- yeah!\n                       933 / 1.901\nI confirmed with Dr. Beavis that other treatments are still available to me (including,\nperhaps, a trial at Sloan) if/when the current one proves unsuccessful. Her response was\nunequivocally affirmative. I asked if there were other approaches I could be trying, other\nthings I could be doing. She responded that the three keys for me remain a)good\nsleep/sufficient rest (I *seem* to be rounding a corner on that); b)activity/exercise (need\nto work on this; I dislike walking outdoors in cold weather but will push myself to do so);\nand c)eating well (no problem there, although I want to rethink my overall plan for\neliminating excess sugars from my diet and privileging healthy foods; it's soup season,\nmethinks, and fortunately the NYTimes recipe app provides a staggering trove of recipes\nfor tasty, healthy eats).\nDr. B. also recommended a zinc supplement to ward off the very slight cold I felt I might\nbe coming down with (but of which she saw no signs in my throat, sinuses, glands etc.).\nThe gyn-onc resident said (when I asked) that it wouldn't hurt to try acupuncture, and to\ncontinue it if I sensed benefit from it, but that their practice remained neutral regarding\nits use.\nAs a small token of thanks, I gave Dr. Beavis and her nurse, Kelly, a jar of something\ngood from Tait Farm, my favorite store in State College (sour cherry jam, cranberry\nchutney). Kelly gave me one of the first of several warm, tight hugs I received that day,\none of the highlights of my day in fact.\nI next walked through the labyrinth of the hospital to Weinberg Building, to say hello to\nRhoda Cooper, the kind, friendly chaplain who had brought me comfort and compassion\nafter my operations. Rhonda is a warm, outgoing woman of 67, with long hair, whose\noffices in the \"Family Services\" section of Weinberg abounds with healing/religious\nimagery from various faiths (a menorah, Russian icons, maybe some Buddhist mantras\netc.). We caught up a bit (she remembered that the 60th bday trip to Lyon I had planned\nfor 2019 with Ben had to be aborted, but that Sammi and Ben were able to go in my\nstead; I remembered a transcontinental train trip she was about to take with her\nhusband, also cancelled due to COVID). I asked her if she would pray with me, and she\ncrafted the most beautiful prayer (which I wish I had recorded), distilling and weaving\nthe various strands of our conversation (healing, Ben, my upcoming trip to Paris, my\nsupport team etc.) into a series of wishes addressed to a higher power. A comforting\nmoment during a hectic and at times stressful day. Grounding.\nHere's a YouTube clip featuring Rhonda: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j41GjOi9AFQ\nRhonda walked me to the Viragh Building for treatment. On the way, she introduced me\nto Moira Bucciarelli, a second chaplain recently been hired to work with cancer patients.\nAt Viragh, I was delighted to see Jesse, a 'greeter' who helps patients check in, prints out\ntheir itineraries if needed, provides directions etc. Rhonda told me that he had been a\n                       934 / 1.901\nvan driver at Hopkins for years. A dapper gentleman (he modeled when he was younger,\nhe told me), Jesse's warm greetings have brightened my chemo days the past month or\nso; he seems to understand the vulnerability and anxiety accompanying many visitors to\nthis clinic. He's so popular that when he has a day off, patients routinely ask: \"Where's\nJesse?\" Jesse's a rock star! This time I remembered to ask for a picture of him, which\nRhonda took. As you'll see in the pic, Jesse embraced me in a welcoming, protective side\nhug (he also smelled good!). Rhonda escorted me to the 10th floor for chemo; before we\nparted, we also embraced: hugs #2 and 3 for the day!\nChemo proceeded smoothly. The Benadryl really knocks me out (I felt like I was slogging\nthrough quicksand, and my mind was very slow in making connections, articulating\nthoughts...). My wonderful friend David took a break from his work to come sit w/me\nduring chemo and we caught up on our holidays, travel, the challenges of David's new\nwork project, gender neutral pronouns and much else. At one point I was so tired though\nthat I had to ask David if he wouldn't mind if I closed my eyes for a few minutes. As soon\nas I did, I felt myself drifting towards sleep (I was lying on a hospital bed as all the chemo\nrooms with lounge chairs were taken). As soon as I fell asleep, however, Ann, the nurse\naffiliated with the clinical trial, stopped by briefly to bring me a new bottle of\nFostamatinib (trial drug that I had been taking along with the chemo but had to stop\nwhen my white blood cells started to decrease) at a new, lower level. I will begin taking\nthese and will see what happens. Nicole, the chemo nurse assigned to me during my\nprevious visits, was busy with other patients but stopped by to say hi (can't say enough\ngood about the Hopkins staff). I finished my treatment in about two hours. David got his\ncar from the garage next door while I sat outside in the sun on this mild day, then drove\nme back to the Residence Inn (I would have enjoyed the fairly short walk, but felt quite\nwoozy still). He too gave me a warm hug when we parted (hug #4!). He kindly invited\nme to stay with him and his husband, Peter, on my next trip to Baltimore (scheduled for\nthe 30th), a gracious invitation I will strongly consider.\nThe service at the Residence Inn has declined markedly (new affront this visit: no soap in\nthe bathroom). However, I will cut the hotel some slack as I surmise that they may be\nunderstaffed. The personnel is resolutely friendly and many of the patients, I presume,\nare here for appointments at Hopkins -- people in wheelchairs (young man with a spinal\ncord injury?), a man with impressive bandaging over his eye and a large part of his face,\nme in my chemo cap. We interact compassionately with one another in the elevator or\nthe lobby, our tacit understanding of one another's travails buoying us. It's a safe space.\nSpeaking of kindness and compassion -- shortly after my return to the hotel, my first\ncousin David (our mothers are sisters) dropped off dinner for me, heeding my request for\nsome deli food if possible. His care package will last me throughout the weekend I'm\nsure: chicken noodle soup, four large pieces of stuffed cabbage (looks delicious), potato\nlatkes for Chanukah, and an enormous sandwich with both pastrami and corned beef (I\nate half of it, and some latkes). So kind of my cousin (a lawyer), who is a real mensch\n                       935 / 1.901\n(and, if she had anything to do with it, his wife Ilene, mother and grandmother\nextraordinaire to a large family). Thank you, dear cousins!\nI fell immediately into a deep sleep at about 4 p.m. When I awoke at 7 p.m. I thought it\nwas 7 a.m. the next day and I prepared to wake up, go get a coffee, and hit the road. I\nfound it strange that I was still in my clothes, hadn't taken off my earrings, and that the\nNYTimes Spelling Bee was not featuring a 'clean' puzzle, as it does each day. I finally\nrealized that Friday had not yet arrived. So I regrouped, watched CNN and had dinner\nwhile writing this journal entry. Hope I can sleep tonight after this long nap!\nOnwards.",

    "entry": "937 / 1.901\n                       938 / 1.901\nNo more weekly trips to Baltimore for now; those were the condition of my participating\nin the clinical trial, during which time I was to be monitored closely by the physicians and\nstaff at Hopkins. From now until whenever I will no longer participate in the trial (a CT\nscan on Dec. 27th will be telling in that regard), I will receive at least two treatments per\ncycle here in State College. While I continue to take my Fostamatinib pill twice daily (at a\nlower dose than originally, as it was impairing my white blood cell count) -- the pill is the\n'extra element' that is the focus of the trial -- I will receive my chemo drug (Taxol) as an\ninfusion here in State College, in addition to the pre-meds (Benadryl, a steroid, an anti-\nnausea med, and something else that I've forgotten).\nSo this week I was back at Scenery Park for my blood draw (Wednesday), then met with\nDr. Patel on Thursday before treatment. It was so nice to see him; I've really grown quite\nfond of him. He reviewed my blood work (nothing warranted treatment being withheld,\nthankfully) and, like Dr. Beavis, tried to sway me from fetishizing my CA125 number,\nwhich, as I noted previously, had risen by 11 and then 12 the past two months and\ncurrently stands at 45 (anything above 35-38 being considered outside normal range).\nWhat Dr. Patel asserts is more important to focus on are cancer-related symptoms, of\nwhich fortunately I have very few: no vomiting, extremely minimal nausea (I rarely take\nanti-nausea meds), healthy appetite and stable weight, no advance in neuropathy, still\npresent in my toes but not my fingers, thank goodness, no mouth sores to speak of (I've\nhad a few, which disappeared quickly with a special mouthwash), stable, normal blood\npressure. The only symptom I still struggle with is diarrhea, but the right dosage of two\nanti-diarrhea meds is helping; that dose just needs to be tweaked occasionally. Still, that\nniggling CA125 number....has to mean...something...right?\nDr. Patel, like Dr. Beavis, is completely behind my going to Paris next month. He\nunderstands what an important mood lifter it will provide for me, how much I miss my\nfriends there, how I love that city so, how excited I am to be travelling with three\noutstanding women friends. He shared with me how a recent trip to visit friends in Des\nMoines, IA, where he used to live, had the same uplifting effect on him. My chemo\nschedule can be tweaked to accommodate the two weeks I'll be away. Now crossing my\nfingers that nothing (Omicron, my own health) confounds our plan. It will have been 2.5\nyears since I've been in Paris. I had to cancel my last trip, to celebrate my 60th bday, as I\nwas recovering from debulking surgery.\nDr. Patel's parting shot to me: \"You're doing well.\" Yeah.\nMy infusion now lasts (only) two hours, one for the pre-meds and one for the chemo. I\nwas happy to see the wonderful nurses in the infusion room, several of whom I feel close\nto, and who are all highly skilled, supportive, friendly and compassionate. One of my\nfavorite nurses, Brynn, took care of me: although Christian (isn't everyone around\n                       939 / 1.901\nhere?), she's 'conversant' w/Jewish culture (I forget how; there's a reason), asked me\nabout my Chanukah celebrations, requested (for a second time!) my chicken soup recipe\n(which I *will* copy for her, now that I've written it out for Ben, with all my tips). Like\nMichael and me, Bynn's parents are amicably divorced and spend holidays together, so\nwe always catch up on that. She and her wife are raising a little girl, and we trade news\nof our kids as well. Several other nurses who I now know fairly well stopped by to say\nhello. Somehow it all felt very comforting. I am pumped so full of Benadryl before the\nchemo infusion that I conked out immediately, and did so after each minor interruption\nto start a new med etc. There is *no way* I could have driven myself home safely after\nchemo, so I'm grateful to my friend Jackie for driving me to Scenery Park in the morning\nand my friend and neighbor Janis for picking me up, with a pitstop at Meyer's dairy,\nwhere I treated myself to a delicious small butterscotch sundae and promptly left my\ncredit card in the reader as I was so loopy (I retrieved it today). Conked out again as\nsoon as I returned home.\nMy energy today surprised me, given that I had just had chemo the day before (although\none hour v. several makes a difference). I ran lots of errands, then took a 50 mile drive\nto buy maple syrup from an Amish farm. Caught up on emails. No nap.\n****\nI also wonder at how a highly-driven, consistently motivated professional with a laser-\nsharp focus on her career for decades (ie me) can currently feel nearly zilch motivation\nto pursue my academic work, while a book review, a book manuscript review and several\nother projects await. It actually amazes me. At least two retired colleagues have shared\nwith me their perception of this post-retirement phase as particularly productive and\nfertile for them. I admire them for this, but it's not me. At least not now. I have an\ninstinct, though, that motivation for academic work will return. At some point.\nThings I am motivated to do right now: spend time with family and friends, lots of it.\nCook, especially for other people. Take long drives in the countryside. Write my blog.\nFinish up a few (autobiographical) stories I've been working on. Cultivate spirituality.\nFundraise for the Kelly Gyn-onc Service at Hopkins. Find time for the 'little things' I\nbarely had time for before: concocting creative gifts for people; writing holiday cards;\ngiving the 'gift of time' (the phrase 'the gift of me' sounds terribly self-aggrandizing...)\nRetort: \"You devoted yourself single-mindedly to your successful career for close to thirty-\nfive years, were a chaired professor at a major research university, wrote three books\n(one that obtained a prestigious award, another nominated for two awards in France),\nedited a fourth, edited a special issue of a journal and produced many articles, taught\nhundreds of students, directed a dozen dissertations (whose authors are all thriving in\ntheir careers) and have a few others en cours, served your department as graduate\ndirector for five years and as department head for two, and went out arguably at the top\nof your game. Surely you can rest on your laurels now and turn to other pursuits in\n                       940 / 1.901\nretirement if you care to? AND you have cancer, for chrissake. Go easy on yourself, girl!\"\nMe: Yes, cognitively I understand this, but please understand that all these\naccomplishments do not diminish the sense of loss or worth or identity I am feeling (the\nword 'slothful' also comes to mind...). And it's hard to know what to do about that, as it\nmakes me feel aimless and frustrated, lacking tangible goals. And I like to have goals.\nImagine how a talented athlete -- or simply anyone used to being active -- feels after a\ndevastating injury. I can certainly ascribe much of this feeling to the double whammy of\nretirement and cancer. And I'm sure COVID fits into the equation somehow. As does, to a\nlesser extent, the absence of an identifiable 'reward structure' (via raises and other\nforms of symbolic 'legitimation'). I also feel the loss of professional colleagues who had\nbecome friends through common conference attendance over many decades, meet ups\nin Paris, collaboration on projects etc. It makes me sad to think that I might lose these\nfriendships if my conference attendance and other forms of visibility in the professional\nrealm remain irregular. Or perhaps professional friendships are a different kind of beast?\nI became very jazzed watching a Ken Burns documentary about the Bard Prison\nInitiative, through which prisoners receive a college-level education (Associate's degree\nor BA/BS) with classes taught largely but not exclusively by Bard faculty. This motivated\nenough for me to check out the website and see how professors could apply. I've always\nbeen intrigued by teaching in prisons and wonder if this is something I might pursue (but\nwith weekly chemo treatments?...); I think my course on France and the Holocaust could\nbe a hit.  The prisoners in this documentary were *extraordinary,* great minds, highly\nmotivated. I had also envisioned work for the Peace Corps as another exciting post-\nretirement possibility. But I may have to adjust my horizons. Or maybe not.\nSo...much..uncertainty about what I will and will not be able to undertake going forward.\nPerhaps it's simply a time to explore the possibilities that radical *freedom* entails:\ntesting the limits of old and new relationships or imagining new ways of being in them;\nmaking memories; trying out new modes of being, doing, saying. \"Freedom's just\nanother word for nothing left to lose [?]\"\nWas delighted to have lunch this week with my \"III Cs,\" our erstwhile OC survivor group\n(reinvigorated this week by the presence of a new member, Mitzi, whose company I\nenjoyed and who is also treated at both Hopkins and by Dr. Patel in State College). This\ndid my heart and soul good!",

    "entry": "942 / 1.901\n                       943 / 1.901\nIt's been almost two weeks since I've written. Since last Saturday I've been in NY, hoping\nto avoid the dreariness and loneliness I often feel in State College around the holidays,\nwhen most everyone clears out. Maria and Greg were heading to the city Saturday for a\nbrief vacation and our road trip sure beat the long train ride that I had booked myself on.\nOn Sunday the immediate family, nine of us, enjoyed a wonderful 85th birthday\ncelebration for my mother, at home, a NY Sunday brunch extraordinaire with all the\nfixins' (Absolute bagels, paper thin smoked salmon and sable and various types of\nherring from Russ and Daughters, cream cheese spreads and salmon roe and olives and\ngherkins and pickled butter beans from Zabar's, and a to-die for chocolate mousse cake\nfrom Veniero's. And Moet :) We continued our quinquennial tradition of asking my\nmother questions (from the matter of fact, \"Tell us about your ideal New York day,\" to\nthe existential: \"Do you have any life lessons for us?\"). Throughout the many hours we\nspent together, toasts were offered, presents given (mine was a photo collage put\ntogether by a local framing place, reaching back to capture my mother at a sweet 16\nparty and then forward to the present), photos taken.\nPerhaps because of the feasting on Sunday -- but who knows? - I've been feeling off\nsince then, with an upset stomach compounded by fatigue. So I've needed to rest a lot,\nwhich is what I suppose my body is calling for. Consequently, I feel somewhat weak and\nget easily winded walking a few blocks. I've been in touch with Justin, my superb nurse\nat JH (ie I emailed him to let him know what's up and he called me *five minutes* after\nthat), who has made some suggestions (reduce anti-diarrheal meds) and wants me to\nkeep in touch with him.\nAdmittedly, the anxiety of potentially needing to go to the ER or Med Expres (which I'm\nnot anticipating at this point) in the midst of the resurgent plague adds to my stress. It is\na very strange, muted time and everyone seems slightly depressed. I hear about more\nfriends/acquaintances with COVID every day. The city seems quieter than usual, but for\nthe swelling lines of people waiting to get tested. Nearly everyone is adjusting holiday\nplans. How long will it be possible to hold out before the virus invades our homes and\nthose of our loved ones, as well?\nUntil Monday of this week, though, I felt on course. My latest infusion, in State College,\nproceeded smoothly -- once it started. Because I had taken a COVID test in light of my\nupcoming travel (all nine of us agreed to do this before gathering on Sunday), and\nbecause this was noted on my Geisinger chart, Dr. Patel's office did not want to proceed\nwith my chemo until the results (negative, in the end) came in, for fear that I might\ntransmit the virus to other cancer patients in the infusion room. I had to explain that I\nwas completely asymptomatic and was taking a test as a precaution before I was\nallowed to proceed with chemo. I also did not know that I needed a magnesium drip that\n                       944 / 1.901\nday, which added two hours to my treatment. In the end everything worked out fine, and\nI actually felt relatively energetic the first two days post-chemo. I believe, though, that\nthe amount of chemo meds progressively accruing in my system is starting to wear me\ndown -- at least that's how it seems to me. \nThanks to my neighbor/friend Janis and my friend Monique for transporting me to/from\nchemo. I was super loopy from Benadryl, but I believe that Monique and I stopped at\nMeyer Dairy after my chemo so that I could indulge in a mini-butterscotch sundae.\nI'll return to State College on Saturday (Xmas) on the Megabus. I reserved both my own\nseat and the one next to mine as a kind of 'buffer' (this is a 'thing' one can now do on the\nMegabus), and in the hopes that the bus will be well-ventilated. My\npelvic/abdominal/chest scan is scheduled for Monday; I'm anxious. When I'm sitting I feel\nsome pressure on my pelvis where I know tumors are located (ie at the top of the\nvagina). Uncomfortable. Then I need to go to Baltimore on the 30th for treatment and to\nbe examined by one of the doctors (Dr. Beavis will be on vacation in CA). I am hoping to\nbe able to drive as long as the weather cooperates; if not, I'm not entirely sure what I'll\ndo -- perhaps see if the reliable driver I've used before, Mohindr Singh, is still available\nfor this type of (costly...) work. I liked it when his wife accompanied him and she shared\nher recipes for Indian rice pudding and other treats. I need to contact my friend David\nMiranda who nicely offered to put me up in Baltimore (I'll need to stay both the 29th and\nthe 30th). I may, then, wind up driving back to State College on the 31st, which seems as\nforlorn as my upcoming Christmas Day Megabus ride.

    "entry": "951 / 1.901\nThis is a good news, bad news tale. I'll start with the good, or at least better, news. Given\nhow tired and generally unwell I've felt recently, I had convinced myself beyond a\nreasonable doubt that my recent scan (which itself went smoothly; the technicians at\nGeisinger Gray's Woods are very pleasant and know me by now) would show\nprogression, as my last one had. The radiologists' reports (from both Geisinger and\nHopkins) sat in my message queue in my portal for a day or two, sending my anxiety\nthrough the roof. The combination of technical medical language and the possibility of\nreceiving devastating news (eg spread to other organs etc.) kept me paralyzed, frozen.\nSo I was grateful when Dr. Beavis called me, as I was in my car in the parking lot at\nScenery Park about to have my bloodwork done, to discuss the results. 'Grateful' does\nnot actually describe the tears that welled up when she called because a)I thought she\nwas in California for vacation and didn't expect to hear from her and b)I was having an\nawful day (more on that awful day in the 'bad news' part of the story). The good news,\nthen, is that my scan shows that my cancer is 'stable.' The existing tumors have\nremained more or less the same size as before. A good number of cancerous lymph\nnodes have *decreased* in size. There are some 'non-specific' spots on my lung(s?), but\nat this point we don't know what they are; it could be cancer or perhaps something\ncompletely different. There is no new cancer in liver, bones, other organs. I will continue\nwith the trial and will be scanned again in eight weeks -- an eight week reprieve, then,\nfrom having my mortality in my face constantly. Fifty-six days, each a blessing. The\nresult also makes me place some hope in the clinical trial; we'll see if these results can\nbe sustained. Yes, this was not the *best possible result,* i.e. regression of the cancer,\nbut it is not progression. Holding steady. And that's a good thing. The 'cherry on top' is\nthat my CA level dropped from last month's 45 to this month's 35, back into normal\nrange. Yay.\nThe bad news is that I spent Tuesday night in the ER. 'Bad' not because there is anything\nseriously wrong, beyond my cancer, but simply because a night spent in Covid Central\nwas traumatizing. In fact, I think Centre County set a record that day for the number of\nCovid cases. [By the way, my friend David will perhaps feel slightly less badly about  not\nbeing able to host me in Baltimore this week -- although I know he'll feel badly for what\nhappened to me instead -- as he and his husband were exhibiting Covid symptoms;\nDavid, I did shift my hotel reservation until next week!]\n                       952 / 1.901\nAs I write this, I'm unsure of what I want from you. Perhaps some sympathy (but never\npity). Perhaps I simply want a record of what happened, as for much of this journal. I do\nfeel some urge to embellish, to sink my writerly chops into descriptions of a hellscape.\nMore challenging to convey the emotions I felt, the sad thoughts that took hold of my\nmind, and the extent to which I hate being in the hospital as it reinforces my sense of\nillness. The hours spent staring into space like a zombie. The crying jags. The broken and\nlost feeling. I try to be  tough (\"Be strong and of good courage\") but after a multi-hour\nwait for a room (five hours? six? seven? eight? I lost track), my nerves felt frayed.\nI do want to assert categorically that the staff at Mount Nittany Medical Center took good\ncare of me. They are doing the best they can while totally overwhelmed (one doctor said\nto me: \"It's a crisis.\").  I was impressed with the two doctors who tended to me. This\nbeing said, I never got out of the ER into the hospital (simply no beds in the hospital so\nan ER room became my de facto hospital room). In some ways I think this was a blessing\nas ER nurses are unflappable. It's just another day of crazy for them.\nI had been spiking some fevers and feeling generally unwell so Dr. Beavis recommended\nI go to the ER (she feared that suppression of my white blood cells was causing a fever,\nwhich can be quite serious). Truth be told, though, I am not completely certain my\nthermometers were giving accurate readings as they were reporting astronomically high\ntemperatures. Both at Dr. Patel's office (where I stopped by to have my temperature\nread by a nurse) and in the hospital, my temps were more or less in the normal range, a\nbit high. So I sheepishly feel that my rush to the hospital may have been cloaked in a\nfalse premise. What is undeniable, though, is that I needed what I call a 'tune up.' The\nchemo destroys so much good stuff along with the cancer cells that I can get very run\ndown, which I think explains why I wasn't feeling great part of the time in NY, very\nfatigued, very winded. In the ER, then, I received a blood transfusion; a three-bag\nmagnesium drip; extra potassium; antibiotics in case of infection; chest X-ray,\nbloodwork, blood cultures etc. I was also swabbed for COVID and am relieved to report\nthat I DON'T have it.\nThe waiting room was the hellscape; the first image above (or below?) came to mind\nimmediately: Michelangelo, \"The Despair of the Damned.\" Absolutely packed to the gills,\npeople coughing, lots of sick kids, no sense at all of when I would be called. As most of\nthe Covid patients at MNMC are unvaccinated, I presume that many in the waiting room\nwere too. The lights are dim and the walls an icky dull green-gray color. To complete the\nghoulish tableau, several manacled prisoners in orange jumpsuits, closely guarded,\nmarched in, ankle chains jangling (I can only presume that COVID is running rampant in\nprisons, although these guys may well have been here for some other reason). Marley's\nghost came to mind, here to warn us of....what? Once I saw the triage nurse for five\nminutes, after several hours, I was sent to another de facto waiting room, also\ncompletely full, to wait for a room in the ER to open up (conversation between a man\n                       953 / 1.901\nand woman across from me: \"I've been waiting six hours.\" \"I've been waiting eight.\"). Oy.\nAfter several hours (?) and a brief screening with a doctor (very nice; impressive), a\nroom in the ER opened up. Thankfully, I only had to spend one night there. To all my\npeeps: please avoid the ER/hospital at all costs if you can!\nThank you, Helen, for dropping off a chocolate milkshake for me just as I told the nurse\nthat I had a hunger headache (dinner Tuesday night: chips and a candy bar). Thanks,\nJackie, for all your concern, good humor, kindness, grocery shopping etc. And Maria,\nthanks for picking me up! Thanks, Julie, for texting. And gratitude to my family of course.\nIf you contacted me and I didn't mention you here, my apologies. I was really strung out\nand may have some selective amnesia regarding my hospital stay.\nI look forward to a calmer 2022. I had a feeling 2021 would not go gently.\nI look forward to renewing my commitment to my wellness.\nI will try to write again tomorrow.\nAs my friend Isabelle recently said to me, I think 'pivot' is *the* word for 2021. And if it\nisn't it should be.\nBack to Baltimore next week.",

XXOO\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, December 30, 2021  \nOh Willa, I am so sorry for that horrible nightmarish experience in the ER. We will\nhowever toast and be grateful for the \"no progression\" results and not testing positive\nfor covid! Hoping you will now be able to rest, and enjoy the next 56 days. Hoping also,\nthat if possible, there can be a trip to Paris in there somewhere... Sending much love to\nyou!\n  \u2014Diana Gonzalez, December 30, 2021  \nMy sympathy is yours, with no hesitation. It does sound like a pit of hellish stress and\nmisery. Along with that is my happiness that there is no progression in the existing\ntumors - and for that chocolate milkshake. I am hugging you.\n  \u2014Jane Ginsberg, December 30, 2021  \nAfter spending many a time in that ER with my mum, I could envision and feel myself in\nthat hellscape you described Willa, and am containing anger at the unvaccinated for\nwhat they continue to put others through. With Michael's father in the hospital, I have\nlearned how hospitals are cesspools of covid so avoiding them at all costs if possible is\nbest. Stable is a wonderful report nonetheless. Wishing you joyful moments in 2022!\nxoxo paula\n  \u2014Paula Golombek, December 31, 2021  \n                       955 / 1.901\nCould anything be more dramatic than the contrast - the \"hellscape\" and the 56\nblessings reprieve, topped with a normal CA level! Your writerly chops serve you and\nothers well in alluding to Michelangelo's despair of the damned, Marley's ghost, crying\njags, zombie, and Kathryn's \"hope-inducing denouement.\" I hope you do write tomorrow.\nXOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, December 31, 2021  \n  \nDecember 31, 2021 - A new year",

    "entry": "2021/2022: my third new year since my diagnosis in Spring 2019. In some\n                       956 / 1.901\nways, that fact amazes me. I attribute my survival to medical and scientific\nadvances (parp inhibitors; clinical trials) deployed by a stellar medical team\nin Baltimore and State College; the consistent, loving support of family and\nfriends near and far; and, I suppose, my own tenacity.\nIn early post-diagnosis conversations with Rabbi Ostrich, he and I agreed\nthat, although cancer is by no means a \"blessing\" (as some would have it),\nit might offer me the possibility of learning a thing or two. This I have, about\nfriendship for example (or perhaps about an area  between 'friendship' and\n'love'), mainly because others have modeled it for me time after time. I\nthought about this when reading a quote from the recently-deceased\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu (a personal hero): \"Your ordinary acts of love and\nhope point to the extraordinary promise that every human life is of\ninestimable value.\" \"Ordinary acts of love\" (so powerful, so precious) have\nbeen manifested to me countless times during my cancer journey, in turn\nleading me to learn more about gratitude. I'm sure I've gleaned other\nlessons too, for example about my own unexpected toughness, but these\nare a few of the main take-aways.\nIn a low moment, my brother, I believe, instructed me to \"think happy\nthoughts.\" This prompted me to return to some of my most memorable New\nYear's Eves: \"I have more memories than if I'd lived a thousand years,\"\nwrites Baudelaire in \"Spleen,\" comparing his memory chambers to a \"heavy\nchest of drawers cluttered with balance-sheets,/Processes, love-letters, verses, ballads,/And\nheavy locks of hair enveloped in receipts.\" Herewith, then, some of my mental clutter:\n1981, Vienna: Because why *wouldn't* one spontaneously book a train trip to Vienna from\nParis for the last week of the year, imagining that the city must look fairytale enchanting at this\ntime of year? No matter that one does not speak German, has never been to Austria, is travelling\nalone. Woke up in my couchette to thrilling views of the snow-covered Alps; the dining car had\nlinen table cloths and I warmed myself with gulashsuppe.  While I was dutifully photographing\na church in a quaint square the day after my arrival, M., a medical student my age who had been\ncontemplating me through his bedroom window, became intrigued, and left his apartment to\nfind out more. We spent the whole week together. I don't think we slept much. The week\nculminated on New Year's Eve at a large club, Kulisse, packed with young people, where at\nmidnight we danced to waltzes by Strauss! I felt like I was floating on air (yes, I felt every inch\nthis timeworn clich\u00e9!). I was twenty-two and having the time of my life! (Cue Frank Sinatra:\n                       957 / 1.901\n\"When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year...\")\n1984, Paris: New Year's Eve dinner at a swanky 'floating restaurant' on the Seine, l'Ile de\nKachmir. A Franco-American affair with about a dozen of us, Vinni, Doris, Rosalie and I, some\nof our new French friends met in our classes at Sciences Po, and friends/partners of those\nfriends. I see from the photos that we are dressed festively (although I'm not in any of the\nphotos), the food as I recall was excellent, the Eiffel Tower glittered for the r\u00e9veillon. My date\nbook reminded me that Vinni and I had just returned that day from a week's vacation in London,\nwhere we had been theatre-goers, museum hoppers, sale shoppers (Selfridge's), and tea\ndrinkers. We had also met for tea with the head of our program at NYU, Nicholas Wahl, whose\nBritish girlfriend's son just happened to be the future prime minister, Boris Johnson! Vinni also\nreminded me, just yesterday, that the meal made a sizeable dent in our grad student finances,\ndespite the very strong American dollar of the mid-1980s (one thing to thank Ronald Reagan\nfor, I suppose). I was twenty-five years old and having the time of my life!\n1985, Madrid: I wish I had a picture of this epic evening, the culmination of a week Vinni and I\nspent in Madrid, mainly in the company of a friend of a friend of hers, a delightful guy named\nPhilip, half-British half-Spanish, who lived in Madrid and reveled in the Madrileno lifestyle that\nwe, consequently, adopted for a week as well: dinner at ten (he took us to wonderful restaurants\nand tapas joints), hit the bars around midnight (always packed, lively), sleep late, a museum or\ntwo in the afternoon. Philip was smart and I have recollections of a week's worth of intense, non-\nstop conversation. On New Year's Eve Vinni and I were to first swing by Phillip's apartment:\nthis is where the now legendary part of the story -- since then recounted many times to our sons\n-- about the two of us wandering cluelessly around a bullfighting ring on a freezing December\nnight, comes in. There were no cell phones, of course, I don't even think we had a map but\neventually we found P's place. We wound up at a smallish yet packed *French* restaurant, in\nfull NYE's mode: great food and drink, over the top conviviality, waiters partying with the\npatrons (or perhaps I embellish here?), silly hats and noisemakers at midnight. Vinni may be\nable to add more details. I was twenty-six and having the time of my life!\nBetween 1988 and 1993 (?), Pittsburgh: Before there were mortgages, before there was tenure,\nbefore there were kids, before Michael and I were even married (I think?), we spent a New\nYears in Pittsburgh with our dear friends Michael and Paula, with whom we celebrated many\nholidays and milestones, always over excellent food and drink. We had dinner at a small\nrestaurant that someone must have known about (unfortunately, I did not record the name in my\ndatebook, but perhaps Paula remembers). Everyone teased me because I was adamant about\n                       958 / 1.901\ngetting back to our borrowed apartment to see the ball drop in Times Square. In the taxi there,\nin a mood of mild hilarity (and closely eyeing the clock as midnight approached), someone\n(me?) asked the cabbie what was the strangest or most memorable thing anyone had ever done\nin his cab. He replied (if I'm not mistaken), \"Took a [xxx].\" New Year's Day, on our way back\nto State College, we received a speeding ticket in a town called Gallitzen, PA (pop. 1500). I\nthink Michael was driving. I was in my early thirties and loved our couples' adventure in\nPittsburgh.\n2011, State College: First Night in State College -- ice sculptures, a drink at Zola, a concert by a\nfolk duo in a church -- followed by late-night dinner at home (pasta and scallops in lemon\ncream sauce, and champagne) with D. A romantic grown-up evening, far from the slightly\nunregulated hijinks of my twenties. D. was a bit of an old soul, so Donny Hathaway fit the\nmood of the evening. I was 52 and enjoying a wonderful evening.\n2018, Paris: At my bff Randy's studio, with an acquaintance of his (a bit of a wise-ass, who\nenjoyed being gratuitously provocative). Randy cooked a delicious stuffed guinea hen (pintade)\nfrom Picard along with some other dishes; I brought champagne and some p\u00e2t\u00e9 (?). That night\nthe guys introduced me to the British comedy series \"Little Britain\" (\"Computer says no\"),\nwhich I found uproariously funny. We laughed uncontrollably most of the evening. I was 59\nand appreciated the laughter and camaraderie.\nMany other new year's eves were spent in New York, Washington, D.C., France, or State\nCollege -- content or depressed or sick or festive or some/none of the above. Sometimes solo,\nsometimes with others, sometimes at long-gone local restaurants (The Governor's Table in\nBellefonte). On Y2K, we stayed up until midnight to make sure the earth wouldn't explode; five-\nyear old Ben made it until midnight! Another year, we navigated First Night and big snowdrifts\nwith a stroller in freezing weather. \nThis year's festivities were lovely: a friend invited me to a small gathering on the early side at\nher home, along with five other folks (all vaccinated). I had just been discharged from the ER\nthe day before and was eager to put that traumatizing experience behind me and ditch my yoga\npants for a pretty skirt from Anne-Elisabeth.  Over a delicious meal (fondue and a variety of\nveggie dishes c/o NYTimes), we laughed heartily about a stinkbug circling the dining table,\nseveral glasses of spilled champagne (or 'mock' champagne) and poppers that wouldn't pop. The\nperfect gathering for me this year. I had a great time.\nGrateful for the all of it.\n                       959 / 1.901\nWishing you good health, happiness, success (however you define or\nmeasure it) and tranquility in 2022.\n \nPhotos\n                       960 / 1.901\n                       961 / 1.901\n                       962 / 1.901\n                       963 / 1.901",

    "title": "January 7, 2022 - Back from Baltimore",
    "author": "Willa Silverman",
    "date": "January 7, 2022",
    "entry": "I'm back from my monthly trip to Baltimore, with Ben in tow. I should say, rather, that\nBen (with some minor grumbling that I found perfectly understandable given the ask!)\nkindly agreed to meet me in Baltimore yesterday afternoon (he traveled by train from\nNY), stay overnight in my hotel (Residence Inn Johns Hopkins) and drive me home today,\nstaying over here in State College until he returns to Brooklyn via Megabus tomorrow.\nThis was a very big boost to me psychologically and emotionally as I didn't feel like I had\nto take on singlehandedly the myriad details involved in my trip and multiple Hopkins\nvisits. Although he didn't accompany me to the Medical Center itself (which was fine), it\nfelt great to see him when he picked me up after chemo!\nEarlier in the week, I had met with my PCP (Primary Care Physician), Paul Damaske, a\nvery sweet, relentlessly upbeat person and good, youngish  doctor who always has\nworthwhile suggestions about my general care despite not being as specialized as Drs.\nBeavis and Patel. He reminded me that when I was first diagnosed, prior to any surgery,\ntreatment regimen etc.,  we were completely in the dark about my future, prognosis etc.\nand he seemed quite enthusiastic about seeing me doing generally well going on three\nyears. He asked if he could give me a hug at the end of our visit, and I consented, an act\nof \"ordinary goodness\" that felt quite caring and confirming!\nI also met (virtually) with my therapist on Tuesday and she remarked (in the course of\nconversation) that I seemed to have a much sounder sense and broader knowledge\nabout my medical condition now than I did at the outset -- which is true. I guess that\nknowledge has empowered me to some extent in coping with the entirety of my\nsituation.\nMy drive down to Baltimore was smooth. Where is everybody? My go-to pit stop location\nin Harrisburg, Alvaro's Bread & Pastry Shop, was closed for winter holiday (these folk\nwork hard and they deserve a break!), so I stopped instead at a funky coffee shop a few\nblocks away, Little Amps, for a breakfast burrito, fuel for the second half of the trip. As I\narrived a day early for my appointments (stopping first at a bakery in Little Italy,\nVaccaro's), I took a rest, wrote some emails and texts, relaxed etc. As mentioned, the\nservice at this hotel has declined: there were no sheets or any type of bedding for Ben's\nbed; requests for toilet paper needed to be reiterated three times; and the food on the\nlimited menu is nearly inedible (I don't say this lightly: hamburger, which I consider a\n'safe' item, was very greasy with raw meat, not medium rare as requested; fries needed\nto be reordered as very soggy; salad was ok!). I do return, though, because of proximity\n                       967 / 1.901\nto Hopkins Medical Center (walking distance if I choose); *very* nice staff a large part of\nwhose clientele is comprised of Hopkins patients (surrounded by folks in wheelchairs,\nothers with imposing eye patches covering half their face etc., my chemo cap passes\nscarcely without notice in what feels like an extremely safe space for me); and high\ntolerance (and indulgence) for some 'slippage' in these hard times, when many in the\nhospitality sector are leaving their jobs.\nSlept so-so, arrived at the dining room a bit too late for breakfast but a very sweet\nemployee was able to bring me some yogurts and a banana, which I supplemented with\na cappuccino and o.j. from the Starbuck's around the corner. Watched some coverage of\nthe one-year anniversary of the 6 January events (about which Ben and I listened to an\nexcellent three-part podcast [\"The Daily\"] on our return drive).\nMy appointments went smoothly. Justin met me at Dr. Beavis' office and had me sign a\nsecond consent form for the clinical trial, clearly explaining each section. He is so kind,\nthorough, skilled and caring, answering my email queries immediately and calling me\nwhen I was in the ER in State College to see how I was feeling. He suggested that I\nincrease my daily magnesium dose as my level is low, and chronically low levels can lead\nto heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure. I know the low level contributes to the\nsearing leg cramps that often incapacitate me temporarily during the night.\nI am so grateful for my medical team.\nDr. Beavis was running late but as usual I had her full attention once she got to me\n(Justin also attended the appointment). She examined me briefly and I brought up all my\nconcerns, new and less new, to her. Among the newer concerns: recent headaches\n(although really none today). We'll wait a week and if they continue; if they do, she'll\norder a brain scan. She does not think it sounds like anything to worry about, and I\nconcur - although the prospect of a brain scan seems scary. I have no other brain tumor\nrelated symptoms (sharp pains, seizures, etc.). Conversely, I know that a)my new,\nstronger glasses can't arrive soon enough; b)I spend more time than I should staring at\nsmall screens; c)I've been having nosebleeds and experiencing sinus pressure recently,\nlikely in part due to dryness in my home. Among the list of potential medical problems I\nworry about, this one is actually quite far down on my list -- for now at least, as cancer\ncells can certainly travel from the belly to the brain.\nAlso, Dr. Beavis confirmed that it's fine to drink the copious amounts of carbonated\nwater that I enjoy -- it's a good way to hydrate, just need to have my dentist check me\ntwice a year for any damage from the carbonation (a low risk). She further did not\ndismiss Dr. Damaske's (PCP's) suggestion (which I found odd) that a stimulant such as\nRitalin or Adderall, usually used to treat ADHD, could boost my energy level. We talked\nabout Covid, what to do if I get it. Answer: call her, situation and protocols are evolving\nrapidly. Hopkins now features a separate ward devoted to cancer patients w/Covid. On\n                       968 / 1.901\nthe list of medical problems I worry about, this one is high up. A good visit, during which\nwe also discovered our mutual taste for pickled foods! She said: \"You're doing great.\"\nTreatment went smoothly. I received a bag of magnesium along with my chemo (a lower\ndose now, because of my low red/white blood cell count). As usual, the Benadryl made\nme super groggy and I dozed a bit. Once in the Viragh Building for chemo, I was happy to\nsee Jesse, the lovely 'concierge' who helps me at the front desk, and whose smile,\ndapper dress, kind words and practical help (eg checking me in, calling the elevator for\nme and pressing my floor button etc.) brighten all my treatment visits!\nBen nicely picked me up in my car after chemo and we headed to La Scala, a wonderful\nplace in Little Italy. We had ordered some pasta and a grilled Caesar salad, quite\ndelicious. My appetite rarely seems to have deserted me, and I've gained back nearly all\nthe weight I lost in the past 2.5 years (30 pounds, at which point I looked scrawny and a\nbit 'caved in'). I'm still fine, normal, and I don't fret a lot about this, but I need to\ncontinue to eat healthily and not use my illness as an excuse to go overboard (as I did\nwhen I was pregnant  (although not an illness, of course!): nightly steamed whole milk\nwith sweet almond or vanilla syrup>70 pound weight gain). In any event, we enjoyed our\ndinner back in the hotel.\nToday I feel better than I have in a long time! I slept well, not waking up once during the\nnight (highly unusual for me). The lower chemo dose obviously helped as did the extra\nmagnesium. And Ben's presence was certainly a balm. He went out to get me coffee and\npicked up some yogurts for me from the dining room. We were on the road before 10\na.m. It had snowed in Baltimore last night so the attendant needed to dislodge quite a bit\nof snow from our front and rear windows, but once on the road the highway and main\nroads were clear and the trip home easy.\nThis week I'll have blood drawn Monday (magnesium) and Tuesday (CBC), then have\nchemo here on Thursday.\nMichael nicely brought over some seafood chowder Sue had made, in case we didn't\nhave food at home (I had bought a good-looking piece of fresh salmon from Maine Bay &\nBerry, but it will remain in the freezer) -- thoughtful and helpful of them. I picked up a\nlarge, crusty sourdough bread from a relatively new baker in town whom I've heard good\nthings about (Bellefonte Bread Baker) and I'll put together a simple salad. It's very cold\noutside (I'm not a winter fan), so we'll spend a cozy evening indoors.\nI forgot to add: my friends and I are postponing our Paris trip. It is not the right time to\ngo. Friends in Paris are even discouraging me from visiting, given the recent Covid surge\nand all the new restrictions in place (all laudable, but they are a disincentive to\nvacationers).  Three of us have underlying conditions and of course our health is a\nconcern. I'm certainly disappointed but also somewhat relieved. We will reschedule for\n                       969 / 1.901\nafter this surge has - hopefully - passed and we can enjoy some of our planned\nactivities.  I spent literally hours on the phone with United to get credit for my flight,\nwhich I can use for up to a year (this after spending literally hours on the phone with my\ninsurance company, but that's another story). So a Paris trip will be something to look\nforward to within the next year. Strange times indeed.\nVoil\u00e0. Shabbat shalom to all who observe.",

I give thanks.\nI agree with your plan to postpone the visit to Paris. Spring and Summer are much nicer\ntimes to be there, as you of all Paris lovers should well know, and it gives you more time\nto anticipate going. I think anticipating a journey is half the fun.\nMuch love,\nAunt Marlene\n  \u2014Marlene Green, January 7, 2022  \nStrong women rule!

Love, Willa\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, January 14, 2022  \nThe cold, snow and ice, and continuing escalating spread of Covid-19 are super reasons\nto stay warm and cozy inside, as Heather recommends. Yes, we give thanks for the good\nnews, and anticipate your delayed Paris trip! XOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, January 7, 2022  \nMy dearest cousin, sorry this is slightly belated, but thinking of you and extremely\nheartened to hear that your amazing medical team continues to give you such superb\ncare -- enabling you to stay completely informed and likely to feel more at peace. How\ngreat that Ben was able to provide such wonderful assistance, and that you got to enjoy\nspecial time with just the two of you. Like another reader here, I also say LOL to the\npregnancy weight gain. That certainly happened to me with Jake, when I could not get\nenough of Pizza Hut's \"stuffed crust\" back then (with hot melted cheese oozing out of\nboth the crust and the pizza!)\nI was also super-glad to read you're doing just fine with the Paris delay, and that your\nfellow travelers are all on board with this wise and totally understandable decision. So\nkeep looking forward, hopefully before long, when this latest surge dissipates and you\ncan return to your Happy Place -- and when the weather should be lovelier as well :)\nLove you, honey!\u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, January 8, 2022  \n                       971 / 1.901\nApril (or May) in Paris: a dream worth waiting for!!

    "entry": "972 / 1.901\n                       973 / 1.901\nEverything went smoothly with this week's chemo. My bloodwork this week apparently\nshowed good results: my magnesium level is up (we doubled the number of slow-mag\ntablets from four to eight daily; I'm also trying to eat magnesium rich foods such as\navocados; consequently, no searing leg cramps during the night, thank goodness); my\nhemoglobin level is also up (for which I credit in part the transfusion in the ER; there is\ncurrently a blood shortage, so *please give this life-giving/sustaining fluid if you can!*).\nI've been *trying* to maintain a healthy/healthier diet, accompanied by new resolutions\nto take advantage of curbside pickup at Wegman's (ie someone else does the shopping\nfor me; grocery shopping is actually an activity I enjoy, especially during farmers market\nseason, but for now this is a time and energy saver) and to make a large quantity of a\nsoup or other healthy dish a week (last week's choice was Harira, a soup eaten all over\nthe Middle East with healthy doses of harissa paste [pic included]; this week I may opt\nfor minestrone).\nThe promising blood results gave me the all-clear for chemo. Since I'm now having\nchemo once a week at a lower dose, the session lasts two hours, one for pre-meds\n(Benadryl that, when delivered through my vein, knocks me out immediately; Zofran and\nsome other drugs), the other for Taxol. Thank you, Helen, for driving me to chemo (and\nfor delivering soup, an almond croissant, and some NK95 masks for me later) and Jackie,\nfor picking me up, taking me to Pump Station drive-through for coffee and Meyer's for a\nbutterscotch ice-cream sundae!! It was great to see both of you and catch up in person,\nhowever briefly. Darn Covid... As usual, I felt pretty peppy the rest of Thursday but tired\ntoday and likely through the weekend, when a big snow-storm is predicted.\nBecause I told Dr. Beavis that I had been having headaches recently -- daily headaches,\nevery morning, unlike my usual (infrequent) type of headaches (these can hit in the back\nof my head, and also upon exertion, with some nausea, although they remain quite well-\ncontrolled throughout the day with Tylenol while still remaining very low-grade the whole\nday) -- she ordered an MRI. I was able to move it up from next Saturday to next Tuesday,\nbut will be at the Lewistown Hospital (about 25 miles from here, over \"Seven\nMountains\"). My unfailingly kind friend Martina offered to take me and bring me back\nand I'm indebted to her for this; we'll also have a chance to catch up and have a few\ngiggles along the way. Friends have suggested various roots causes: stress? sinus woes\n(it's dry here, and my nose is quite bloodied, chronically, despite regular squirts of saline\nspray)?; eye strain (small screens...)?; Covid (I'm asymptomatic aside from fatigue\nattributable to cancer, but this is another reason why I'll test)\"; all the meds?\nMy brain's my thing. Without a fully functioning one, or one invaded by sneaky cancer\ncells (in her sometimes chipper way, Dr. Beavis confirmed that cancer cells can easily\ntravel from the belly to the brain), what/who am I (cue frantic, spiraling thoughts here\nabout my mortality)? \"Je pense, donc je suis,\" and all that, but my professional life and\n                       974 / 1.901\nidentity are predicated on having a pretty good one (brain, that is). So please have a\ngood thought for me on Tuesday the 18th though about 12:30 [Denis, I will contact you\nto rearrange our Zoom meeting, as I was lucky enough to be able to move this scan up\nfrom the 22nd to the 18th]. Meanwhile: stay in the moment, breathe (am thinking about\ntaking a six-session online meditation course with a local instructor, beginning this\nMonday evening), think about the agency I still *do* have as long as I'm here. And I'll\nknow more next week. Am not really experiencing any other symptoms of brain tumors\n(searing, radiating pains, confusion, weakness on one side of the body, personality\nchanges>am still able to get to Genius most days in the NYTimes Spelling Bee - and to\nwrite this blog...) so hopefully....it's....not that?\nI am sending a mi shebeirach this evening tp my college classmate, Brenda Russell,\nwhom I only met post-graduation (through another classmate, Brenda Prescott) - I wish I\nhad known both these women better in college, but that's another matter. Like me,\nBrenda has OC, stage 4. She texted me last night as she's going back into the hospital\nfor the chronic vomiting that put her there once before. This time, because of Covid, she\ncan't have visitors. I know what a difference that can make, emotionally and\npsychologically. She asked me to direct prayers in her direction, and I will (as well as to\nmy cousin, June, and a few others challenged by illness and/or caregiving duties right\nnow).\nRandom stuff: am reading _Cloud Cuckoo Land,_ the new novel by Thomas Doerr (whose\n_All the Light You Cannot See_ I think I preferred); watched _The Power of the Dog,_ Jane\nCampion's new film, with Ben last week and needed to read a few good reviews to\nexplain the ending to me. Looking forward to Zooming with my NYU grad school besties\nin MA, NJ, NY and Paris this Sunday. Covid is making my world smaller right now,\nunfortunately, but at least email, Zoom and social media provide ways of staying in\ntouch. Strange times.\nShabbat shalom. Stay well, everyone.",

    "entry": "981 / 1.901\nI thought it might be helpful for people to hear from me directly, for some reassurance.\nWriting on my tiny phone screen so might take a while.\nYesterday, my angel, Martina, the dear friend who spent most of Monday and Tuesday\nwith me, in State College and in the ER at the Geisinger Hospital in Lewistown, PA, joked\nabout the big guy next to us who kept farting as we recalled a memorable performance\nof a few summers ago, when moving in a very densely packed area together at our\nsummer Arts Fest, a big guy let some huge ones rip, sending the crowd scattering,\neveryone looking vaguely horrified, aghast, staring accusingly at one another. We\ngiggled over this and decided we needed to talk about how we were raised around this\nissue, out in the open so to speak. And yes, until I was shoved into a helicopter, strapped\ninto a gurney, and taken to Hopkins - an adventure into itself that afforded an\nunparalleled aerial view of \u2018Baltimore by Night\u2019 -we laughed about my driving around for\nseveral days recently with a big jar of pickles to locate someone to open- one of the few\nfoods I could stomach.\nThen ex-hubby Michael and I made brain jokes until that got old. He\u2019s definitely in my\nsupport camp (and Ben\u2019s) - we always did well with coparenting of our nifty left\nbrain/right brain young man, just back from vacay in Mexico w Sammi, gearing up for\nlast semester MS program in Data Science at NYU, and buying fish I\u2019ve never heard of at\nthe Brooklyn Food Coop to cook into some yummy fish curry.\nGod, let me be allowed a little humor, and some potty-mouthed regression pre-brain\nsurgery as a coping mechanism. Laughter makes my soul feel better. Love to all.\u2764\ufe0f\nMedical update to follow.\nSent from CaringBridge iPhone app",

    "entry": "Gas, is a hard act to follow, butt I will try. For those possibly needing some levity, I\u2019ve\nattached an amusing clip (imho) from Mel Brooks\u2019 Blazing Saddles.\nI just had a long call from Willa, who asked that I provide a medical update. She had a\nsonogram today of her arms and legs to detect any clotting. Results are still pending.\nIn the meantime, she is taking the blood thinner Heparin, and a cocktail of other\nmedicines to alleviate head distress et al. Her head pain is much better, mostly\nuncomfortable when she exerts or strains herself. \nWhile she was out for the sonogram, Justin, from Dr Beavis\u2019 team, came by to see her.\nAlthough she missed him (a note though was left), one of Willa\u2019s favorite JH spiritual\nadvisors (chaplain), The Rev. Rhonda S. Cooper, came for a visit.\nA Neurosurgeon/team has not stopped by at this point, but Willa was hopeful for this\nafternoon. \nHence, a date has still not been set for surgery. Unforeseen circumstances or a downturn\nwould be the only reason for it to occur before the weekend, which is unlikely.\nStay tuned!\nDespite Covid, and a slightly reduced staff, she is still receiving superb care and\nattention.\n                       984 / 1.901\nWe\u2019re putting in place the team (family member), that will be on the ground and with her\nat the hospital, pre and post-op. Unfortunately, only I person is allowed.\nYour dings are not going un-noticed.

    "entry": "I will try to provide an update. I feel gratified, humbled, flattered by the many texts and\nemails I have received. My apologies for not being able to respond to each one\nindividually; I simply don't have the bandwidth. Know that your thoughts and caring and\nconcern and well wishes and acts of kindness and love mean the world to me. But I likely\ncan't respond for a while. I will be 'going away' for a while -- post-op, to where I'm not\nsure but there will be some process of working on coordination and I don't know what I'll\nbe able to do, to take care of. In the meantime, please don't abandon or forget me! I'll be\nback!\nAll opinions and wishes are converging on a surgical option for me, perhaps next\nWednesday. I have a largeish mass (5 cm?) in my cerebellum, at the base of my skull\nand perhaps some other stray lesions that need to be dinged out with a gamma knife.\nThis will be followed by radiation (hopefully in State College). Going straight to radiation\nis not an option for me: my tumor is too large. I wouldn't make it past a few months.\nSurgery makes sense from all points of view: my overall life expectancy, overall good\nhealth, wishes and desires, including strong desire to be here.  But of course it's risky\n(my surgery day is described as 'the riskiest day of my life') because we are entering\nground zero for everything that controls my life, identity and actions. I could have a brain\nbleed, and there are many other complications that can ensue. Fortunately, sonograms\nreveal no blood clots (common in cancer) that could complicate blood flow, and I'm on an\nanticoagulant (Heparin) to replace Eliquis and that will leave my body in a few days.\nDr. Beavis, who is coordinating things and who has been wonderful, counsels surgery. So\ndoes the neuro team of course. From watching videos, it seems that neurosurgery was\npioneered here at Hopkins w/Harvey Cushing (early 20th c.). The brain surgeons are a\ndifferent breed -- and they're allowed to be -- all male, supremely confident, not warm\nand fuzzy but fantastic doctors. The one I met and spoke with for about an hour, Dr.\n                       987 / 1.901\nChristopher Jackson, is of this breed - southern accent, young guy, tall and broad\nshouldered, courteous, hair parted neatly to one side, deliberate in his delivery. He was\ncompletely a straight shooter with me, which I appreciated, offering me his services next\nW (I am on his schedule, as he had a cancellation), but also those of men \"with more\ngrey hairs\" should I want. So it is possible that one of the 'higher ups' with more\nexperience may do the job, if their schedules jive with my time slot for next W. If not, Dr.\nJackson will perform; I don't need to like him tons (as I do Dr. Beavis); he only has to do\ngood work. He was trained at Hopkins and has many awards and accolades to his name.\nIt seems that things were a bit touch and go as I was 'life flighted' down to Hopkins\nTuesday night. Pressure was building in my skull, which is why I was having searing\nheadaches every morning, throughout the day and on exertion, for several weeks. And\nthey were getting worse. The tumor may have been building for a while, but I've only\nrecently become symptomatic. The brain MRI at Geisinger in Lewistown on Tuesday\nrevealed the mets (their ER was great, by the way). My friend David Rothman has written\neloquently and much more technically about this elsewhere, as he's been down this road\nbefore... and is a solace to me right now.\nUntil surgery, then, pressure in my skull is being relieved mainly by a steroid (Decadron)\nand a 'cocktail' of Benadryl, Tylenol, and Raglan. I am stable and feel ok, except on any\ntype of exertion (like going to the bathroom), at which point I get a searing pain in my\nhead. Unless anything acute occurs, I should be ok for a few more days. \nFor now, treatment of my OC remains off until the brain issue is attended to. And that's\nok as my last scan was stable. I don't know about the modalities of dealing with two\ntypes of cancer. Tbd.\nThe staff here continues to be terrific, from doctors to sheet changers. They are all kind,\nattentive, and skilled. I am being very well taken care of here and am grateful for it.\n(Last Monday, Dr. Patel's PA was ineffectual; when I told her my headache pain was a 10,\nher mouth formed into a little circle as she whispered \"Oh.\" I thought she would send me\nto have a brain MRI immediately, not wait another day. Otherwise, she prescribed a\nbroad spectrum antibiotic and some Tylenol w/Percocet. I had to come home and lie\ndown immediately. Lesson: be one's own  best advocate).\nI have a few fairy godmothers from within the hospital to thank! Chaplain Cooper\n(Rhonda, with whom I've developed a friendship and who always leaves me with a\nblessing of invitation to the Spirit and/or of gratitude for the caregivers) brought me,\nyesterday, per my cravings, a container of half-sour pickles and a box of cookies from\nVaccaro's -- all from wonderful Italian take out places in Canton. Then Gae, a palliative\ncare nurse with whom I've bonded around mindfulness, Kripalu, meditation and other\ntopics (including my work!), also brought me Tiramisu from an Italian restaurant so we\ncan do a Tiramisu taste test, and some rainbow cookies, which I love. How kind!\n                       988 / 1.901\nAnother dear angel from State College, Helen, and her dear hubby, Greg, also drove\ndown from State College (3+ hours) to bring me clothes, makeup, my computer and iPad\nand other items, plus French pastries.  It's indeed a nice (albeit very cold, apparently)\nday to take the pretty drive from SC to Baltimore, while listening to podcasts;\nnevertheless, Helen is preparing for a big work trip tomorrow and she and Greg definitely\nwent out of their way to help. So very thoughtful; Helen did not like thinking of me\nwithout my stuff. So now I'm snug in a pink cotton shirt I like and yoga pants, Kiehl's\nserums and avocado eye cream at the ready.\nThanks too to very dear ones Martina, Jackie, Janis, Michael and of course Ethan, Ben etc.\nfor keeping everything in order for me at home and elsewhere. We are still discussing\nwhich person will be with me next week (>Covid rules: one person allowed in over seven\nday period).\nMantras:\n>Until I'm dead, I'm living and my life has value.\n>Thank you, Josh, for your wisdom from your Kung Fu and karate practice. Always move\nforward. The most dangerous position (to the other) by the warrior is when she has her\nback against the wall. I'm in warrior goddess mode.\n>\"Just like moons and like suns,\nWith the certainty of tides,\nJust like hopes springing high,\nStill I'll rise.\"\n\u2014Maya Angelou\nAll spoken like a cancer patient I suppose.\nLife is strange and wonderful and mysterious and awful, on occasion. This new 'through\nthe Looking Glass' phase is certainly odd, but after a little while it becomes normalized --\neven with brain surgery involved. All because of some sneaky rogue cells...\nI need to be around to continue to raise up the best possible young man, to be a good\n                       989 / 1.901\ndaughter, sister, niece, cousin, aunt, inlaw, ex to an extended family etc. Much as I'd\nprefer to be home today baking a flourless chocolate cake and simmering some soup -\nminestrone w/pasta, and Parmesan on top - listening to music in my cozy home - here I\nam. \nPlease forgive any typos or omissions. I'm a bit groggy from the meds.\nBe well. XO",

    "entry": "Good Morning!\nI can honestly say that many milestones were met yesterday, especially from the time I\nsaw her in the am until I left just past 6 pm.\nIn somewhat of a chronological order:\nShe began to have an appetite, eating cereal, greek yogurt, tuna salad sandwich\non stale bread and omelette w/potatoes.\nShe put her glasses on for the first time since just prior to surgery. Vital for\nWilla\u2019s existence.\nShe easily passed all of her neurological, bedside exams of reciting name, date,\nbday, and location, as well as touching fingers to nose, etc.\nShe was moved off the NCCU to the top floor of Zayed (12E), a step down room,\nand launching pad towards recovery.\nShe was able to get off the bed and make it to the bathroom, as her digestive\nsystem was beginning to wake up after lengthy periods of anesthesia and\nsedation. \nShe received encouraging reports and visits from Dr Bettegowda (who called me\nas well) and Dr Beavis, assuring her that everything was \u201cpar for the course\u201dand\ntake it \u201cslow and steady\u201d.\n                    \nThe transfer from nccu (3rd floor zayed) to 12E was uncomfortable, and a bit noisy, as\none would potentially expect. We all tried to minimize the disruption though and it\ntranspired fairly quickly. I successfully wheeled and moved her luggage, with phone,\nlaptop, keepsakes in it, that she has yet to use.\nShe did get taken for an mri (protocol/don\u2019t know results yet), soon after arrival on 12,\nwhich really jostled her and upset her. Fortunately her new nurses and technicians,\neased her back to a comfortable state quickly.\nRight before I left, Ben (my nephew!) called and I was able to put him on speaker so that\nhe and Willa could talk. This was the first time they spoke since Tuesday evening.\nNeedless to say - highlight of the day hearing them converse.\nI\u2019m grateful that I brought a lb. of my Zabar\u2019s coffee, cone, and filter from NYC, for\nmodern technology (iphones, JH), my friends (college roommate took me out to dinner\nlast night at Fells Point\u2019s The Black Olive), family (our cousins the Eagles left a beautiful\ncare package), and for sticking by our side, and the vast network of concerned friends\nout there!\nLGR - my kids will be at the Henrik Lundquist Jersey/# retirement ceremony and game\nthis evening at MSG.

    "entry": "Willa is currently in the hall with the physical therapist taking her second walk in two\ndays. I believe they are practicing stairs, as Willa has a few to negotiate getting into her\nhouse in SC. Her walking with a walker is quite good btw.\nAs Willa said to me when I arrived this morning, she\u2019s been getting \u201cmicro-sleeps\u201d. She\nwill need much needed rest in the coming days and weeks.\nYesterday was a total blur for me as almost too many moving parts were happening\nsimultaneously. I called in my resources, and Ben arrived by Amtrak around 11 pm last\nevening. Good thing, as he texted me moments ago that the Northeast Regional and\nAcela trains were all suspended.\nThe neurosurgeons have reassured me that they have \u201caddressed the problem\u201d, she is\n\u201cin control\u201d, and that there isn\u2019t anything they can do for her at the hospital, that she\ncan\u2019t do for herself at home. Hopefully the latter will come with much assistance from\nqualified professionals and a host of family/friends.\nIt appears that Willa will be discharged today!\nFor me this is both an exciting and frightening prospect.\nDepending on the hour, we will most likely stay overnight in Baltimore and venture back\nto SC on Sunday morning.\nStay tuned/Much love - Ethan\n                    \nps - I forgot to mention that Willa had a nice nurse yesterday from the Congo, Vigeur,\nwhom she conversed with in French.\nSent from CaringBridge iPhone app",

    "entry": "I wonder if Dorothy was having a neurological incident when \"the wind began to\nswitch/The house to pitch/and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch.\" Several hours\nlater -- or was it eons? - she was back in her bedroom in Kansas, surrounded by the\nfamiliar, watchful faces of Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the farmhands, her erstwhile\ncompanions, at some point, on a fantastic voyage to Oz. \"There, there, you lie quiet. You\njust had a bad dream.\" And that's where I found myself, in the glow of a cold late January\nafternoon yesterday, after a two week odyssey, back in my bedroom, under the watchful\neyes of my companions. But it was Ben and Sammi making shaksuka in the kitchen (a\nhealthy, nourishing dinner). And it was Michael bringing black raspberry flying saucers\nfrom Meyers' Dairy. And it was Maria, overseeing my first  shower in two weeks (bacterial\nwipes had sufficed in the hospital). And it was pails full of fresh flowers being carted into\nmy home from my friend Andrew and his sweet daughter/former student/former\nelementary school pal of Ben's (that's how we roll around here), Clare. And it was gifts\nand notes from my angels Clare C., Martina, Jackie, Kathryn, Monique, Helen (and likely\nothers). Their spirits have all tarried near me the past two weeks. Weren't they all here\nwith me, at some point, in a galaxy far, far away?\nThe witch with her spindly legs lay dead under the house, just like metastasized shavings\nfrom my cerebellum had shriveled and died, too.\nI have the utmost compassion for my fellow neuro survivors: stroke victims, those\nsurviving with brain cancer, contending with gamma knives and radiation, those with\nspinal cord injuries. Two notes: compassion does not equal pity party; compassion for\nneuro patients does not negate my strong feelings of empathy for those contending with\nother diseases such as MS. But we are really dealing with Command Central for all that is\nvital to identity, memory, coordination, motor control, all that is vital to one's essence.\nWe are in another realm.\nAll Hail and Praise to Dr. Chetan Beddegowda at Johns Hopkins, the man who saved my\nlife. He has all the qualities I could ever imagine a stellar neurosurgeon to possess:\npatience, steady hands, laser-sharp (pun intended) focus, compassion, thoroughness,\nmeticulousness, deliberateness, modesty despite confidence. Early forties (?), Hopkins\ntrained, chaired professor of neurosurgery. Every early morning or  late evening post\nsurgery, he would appear at my bedside quietly, like a cat, to check on me and answer\nall my questions thoroughly and patiently in a quiet, calm, reassuring tone. I am glad\nthat the young Dr. Christopher Walker, trained by Dr. Beddegowda, saw to it that I\nreceived care only from a 'higher up,' untinged by any ego game on his part.\nApparently, the surgery went very well. Not only did Dr. Beddegowda remove the\ndiseased parts of my cerebellum; he also was able to manipulate fluid so things would\nrun more smoothly (I'm hopelessly defective in terms of 'neuro lingo,' but you get my\n                    \npoint). We will now proceed to radiate other cancerous parts of the brain, which I believe\ncan be done here (I'll have my first radiation consult on Wednesday). The crucial thing,\nas the Dr. told me, is that I simply needed the surgery to relieve the pressure building at\nthe base of my skull in a worrisome way, as clearly reflected in Martina's expression as\nshe stood on the roof of Lewistown Hospital clutching my vomit soaked sweater and\ncomfy but ugly black Skechers, watching helplessly as I was air lifted to Hopkins. At my\nlast meeting with Dr. Beddegowda, he broke Covid protocol and took my hand in his,\ngratified for the essential human contact passing between us.\nThe only way out was through. As mentioned, had we proceeded straight to radiation,\nbypassing a surgical option, I'd probably make it a few months. The surgery gives me the\nbest chance at optimizing my quality of life for as long as I'm here (more on that at some\npoint). And I really want to be here.\nI also thank Dr. Gawad Kalifa, Dr. Beddegowda's resident, for checking my incision daily,\nanswering my questions, and showing much kindness towards me.\nI am flabbergasted to find my overall motor skills so finely tuned, although there may be\na bit of denial involved. I am still using a walker. I can't drive for about 6-9 weeks. I will\nbe receiving OT/PT/LpN (Licensed Practical Nurse) help by next week at the latest\n(covered by Aetna). However, I can text (for better or worse), talk on the phone, write\netc. and did not have to 'relearn' basic skills I thought I would need. My memory,\nintelligence and personality have remained unchanged, one of my biggest concerns. I do\nneed a bit of help with coordination. And I may need some help with 'executive function'\n(like better ways of bill paying), little tips for getting dressed, cooking that I love to do\netc.\nAll Hail and Praise to the extraordinary nursing staff at Hopkins. And much praise to the\nLewistown Hospital ER, run as a tight ship by Mallory. They saw me promptly, got me\ninto an MRI tube quickly to take images of my brain, noted the mets, got on the phone\nquickly with Hopkins and had me dispatched there swiftly. So much better than Mount\nNittany Medical Center, IMO. The staff at Hopkins is uniformly skilled and compassionate,\nundertaking challenging work for (likely) low pay in very challenging conditions due in\npart to Covid. Nurse Jamie Levy is a wonder: take charge, upbeat, skillful - she reminds\nme of my friend the art historian Marni Kessler! We were able to dish about favorite\nbooks, upcoming vacations while I trusted her entirely. And let's hear it for the two Tylers\n(unflappable, kind, skillful young guys), Bo with her bleached blonde hair and her tanning\nbeds (and her consummate skill), Carissa, Lynn, Cristina and many others. It was in my\npower to be kind (even though packing four nursing students into a small room tried my\npatience at times), while the staff remained unfailingly professional -- and kept me Covid\nsafe the whole time.\nBrain cancer surgery and treatment is not for the faint of heart. Please see photo of my\n                    \narm, below. It is covered with a huge black and blue mark. Today I went to see a nurse\nsimply to have various needles and catheters removed from my body. In the hospital, I\nreceived a Foley catheter and then two stray caths because I couldn't pee. I had two\nMRIs of my brain; after each experience of being inserted into a tube while I had to\nremain ultra still and listen to the sound of jack hammering around my head for 45\nminutes, I was sort of 'dumped' back into a hallway while awaiting transport back to my\nroom - a lonely, dispiriting time. Once my MRI was promised for 11 p.m. but did not\nhappen until 7 a.m., which messed up my biorhythms. I had a last minute 'surprise' when\nmy port became occluded and needed to have a special med injected into it - that took\nthe final few hours of discharge day, as did various magnesium and potassium drips. And\nthere were lots of late night procedures, pokes, prods, vitals, finger pricks for blood\nsugar etc. A piece of my skull has been removed. There is titanium mesh under it and a\ntitanium rod has been placed somewhere. I have about 25 stitches in a large spiral at the\nbase of my neck, am covered in iodine stripes. I'm pumped up on Oxycontin and\nDecadron, a steroid, plus about eight other meds. Neck pain is considerable yet\ndiminishing. A warrior of sorts. And I've made it to the other side.\nSo yes, I am 'coming along.' My brother, who catered to my every need, oversaw every\ndetail, was my only visitor for a week (Covid oblige...) but we got Ben down to Baltimore\nbefore the northeast corridor was completely shut to train travel. Sammi is also here\nnow; she took the train from NY (just as her neighbor, Mr. Lopez, was having chest pains\nand needed to be attended to by EMS...). There was also a reference on CB to my\n'sassiness' at some point (>Party in Willa's room later??) and appearances and\ndisappearances by random college classmates. Apparently the wives are now deputized\nto send greetings from their spouses, the classmates I haven't spoken to since three\nreunions ago. My point is that I've worked very hard for the past three years to curate a\nsafe space and I fear that the Caring Bridge I've worked so hard to maintain may be at\nrisk of breaking. If you cannot commit to respectfully following me/joining me in my\njourney, I simply ask that you go away. I do understand the need to communicate well\nwishes. The vast majority of my readers are a great solace to me. But I'm recovering\nfrom - well - brain surgery, for fuck's sake.\nBut I digress.\nFinally, I thank Dr. Beavis for 'quarterbacking' my entire stay. She was uninvolved in the\nneuro side of things but she was able to see the big picture and let me know what was\ngoing on. She was waiting for me in the hallway as I arrived from Geisinger. She and her\npal, Dr. Schneider, were the antidote to the neuro team. While of course Dr. Beavis is a\nsuperior physician and surgeon, there was something I appreciated in her slightly more\n'hands on' (literally) approach and manner of showing compassion.\nI asked her thoughts on patients dying, sometime during the first week. She strongly\nbelieves that, if possible, people should have the death they want, a 'good death.' This is\n                    \nsomething I'll be thinking/reading more about (but not becoming obsessed with!). If\nsomeone wishes to gather family at the beach for a final hurrah, those wishes should be\nrespected. My father did not have the death he wanted, I believe. It was a nightmarish\nfour-year ordeal punctuated by ERs, a rotation of caregivers, dirt, vermin and sadness,\ndespite my brother's valiant efforts. So I'm thinking about a villa in southern France in a\npretty village with a great market, a pool and maybe a chef! Day trips. Family and\nfriends invited for good conversation and healthful, delicious food.\nFinally, let me thank the wonderful chaplain Rhonda Cooper for bringing me Italian\ncookies from Vaccaro's and tiramisu, along with a palliative care nurse, Gae (or maybe\nJae) -- tiramisu and rainbow cookies from Brooklyn - and pickles! I am somewhat\nobsessed with 'old school' Italian pastry so, contrasted with my more or less daily\nhospital quesadilla and small Caesar salad, these treats were manna!\nAnd yes, one more -- my dear first cousin David (our mothers are sisters) and wife Ilene\n(Yehudis), left me thoughtful care packages from some great kosher delis in Baltimore:\nbagels, cream cheese, whitefish spread, bran muffins - delicious! And I so appreciate\nyour wanting 'a world with Willa in it' and for taking the time to have some words with\nyour eldest daughter, Toby, at the cemetery. I feel Toby's spirit and power breathing life\ninto me. Her acts of goodness know no bounds and have clearly continued outside the\nbonds of her earthly existence.\nTo be continued - this will likely need to be cleaned up, but there's a lot to write...\n \n \n \n \n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "Thanks for the many comments and expression of concern on my last blog. I actually\nwrote most of it in my head in the hospital, when I was bored. My former mentor Tony\nJudt used a similar technique in _The Memory Chalet_ (forgive missing accent), at night,\nas his body wasted from ALS. I had to convey a sense of what I was going through. But\nmy wise, caring, skilled friend Dr. Andrew Compaine is right: I need to heal my psyche,\nnot just my poor old organ (although it felt like it got a workout last night when I was\nwriting!).\nSo a few more things:\nI was gifted the most amazing privilege my first night post-op, as machines buzzed and\nwhirred in the ICU, as I lay all night with neurons pulsing (do they pulse?), as the drugs\nacted both to sedate and relax me, as I drifted in and out of sleep, as God (according to\nchaplain Naftali) stood close by my bedside, where I *needed* them to be: I was able to\n                    \nreview what seemed like my entire life. It was very clarifying. First, I revisited in detail\nthe first two car trips Michael and I ever took to France: I was still very caught up in the\nsmall village life, in French food and wine culture, in certain stereotypes. So we detoured\nto the Vouvray wine region in the Loire Valley because we had discovered we liked the\nwine, enjoyed incredible meals in Lyon, Dijon and the Pyrenees (sorry for lack of\naccents), the thick Michelin guidebooks (red and green) and the maps strewing the car.\nThe gleaming silver canisters filled with fragrant peach sorbet set among the rustic\nstones of Provence returned to me, and the best ratatouille ever (in a paper container at\nmarket, slathered and thick with olive oil and fresh thyme and salty olives), falling asleep\nunder a tree in a village in the southwest after imbibing too many prunes in Armagnac\non a hot summer day. A picture perfect Sunday brunch in a Provencal hill town (insert\naccent under 'c'), under a billowing white cloth, daisies casually placed in a vase, a crisp\nrose chilling while we ate sweet/salty tomato jam on pain grille, I snapped a picture of\nthe often fairly high strung Michael leaning on one hand in a loose open man tailored\nshirt, looking more relaxed than I had ever seen him (I think I took that pic to the\nhospital when Ben was born, to calm me down). It's a miracle that we survived the car\nride down from that hilltop. Then I reviewed in detail the first two trips we took to Paris\nwith Ben, also relatively happy times. Then, somehow, the power dynamics among us\nstarted to shift, things slipped out of harmony. In the end, though, I think both Michael\nand I got the lives we wanted (aside from illness, naturally), and I'm grateful for Sue's\nrole in it.  Took a few years. For my part, it was much about independence (cue Joni\nMitchell's \"Cactus Tree\" should you wish to know more). So all is harmonious there, and\neverything around Ben is surrounded in goodness and light (from the cosmic perspective\nof that night).\nA blotch appeared on my life (it actually appeared as a big black blotch in this dream). It\nis documented in my personal archive, in a poem, stories, diaries, and dream books.  My\narchive (thank goodness for my family's collective archival impulse!) also contains all my\ndate books from about 1977 on (stuffed with ticket stubs etc.), reams of letters from my\nmother, father, brother, grandmother, cousin Julie, ex-college bf Greg, air letters from\nFrance, photos, mementoes, copies of letters I've written that friends have shared with\nme. I know the word 'archive' is rather high falutin, but it will remain (probably in clear\nplastic boxes except if I want to go full Baudelairean and transform my archive into \"un\ngros meuble \u00e0 tiroirs encombr\u00e9 de bilans,/De vers, de billets doux, de proc\u00e8s, de\nromances,/Avec de lourds cheveux roul\u00e9s dans des quittances\") for grandchildren or\nreally anyone who would like a snapshot of what life was like for a girl growing up in NYC\nin the 1970s/80s, who then became enamored of France, spending most of her twenties\nthere post-Harvard, then moving into grad school at NYU and a thirty+ year professional\nlife. Likely more on this later. I'll put together an archive for Ben, too.\nThe professional stuff (notes, books, articles, course materials) is in in boxes, on my book\nshelves, and out in the world, where it should be.\n                    \nBy the morning I was not understanding why people didn't say \"I love you\" to each other\nmore. There is a tendency to banalize this phrase, I suppose, but I realize it's something I\nsay fairly rarely to my friends and even certain family members. In my dream I had much\nclarity about which friends and family members had succeeded in knowing me\nauthentically, and vice-versa. There has sometimes been tussle and what I would call\n'smackdown' or 'throwdown' - relationships are not easy - but we've kept it real over\nmany years. A few examples come to mind (and these are *not* exclusive): my dear\nmother, my dear friend Vinni, my equally dear friend Monique, my beloved cousin Julie\nEagle-Cardo, Michael. I need to think further about other examples, but please know my\ngreat gratitude for 'keeping it real' with me. When my rabbi from State College, David\nOstrich, and I spoke on the phone about a week ago, he shared with me his thought that\nthis (final?) phase can be very clarifying -- about relationships, about what's of value. \nI really don't remember much else. In the morning I felt like I had been through the\nwringer. By the third night, my dreams had returned to the relatively banal (I had a\nFrench class to teach a large group on the top floor of an exposed industrial building in\nsweltering heat - 95/100 degrees - the dominant color was blood red. I wore a stretched\nout pink/red t-shirt and crumpled slacks. I told the students that I wanted to do some\ngrammar review and then go over related content but I was so thirsty I was slurring my\nwords. The students were hanging in there with me but seemed physically\nuncomfortable exposed to the brutal sunlight. It was the opposite of the carefree Sunday\nimage of lunch with Michael in the hill town).\nLifespan: I am unsure how long I'll be here. My oncologist here. Dr. Patel, refuses to\nmake predictions because each case is so individualized. But now it seems germane. Dr.\nBeavis suggested 6 months-two years, with my lying somewhat on the outer edge of life\nexpectancies situated in a bell curve. Initially, this very short time period threw me for a\nloop. But I'm also scrolling through accounts of patients defying their oncologists'\npredictions; we know that Hopkins patients receive the best care and therefore live\nlonger, that I'm a vibrant woman in my early 60s with no pre-existing conditions, that my\nspirit is strong yadda yadda. At the same time, there is the new reality of dealing with\ntwo cancers (OC treatment on hold for now but will be resumed) and all the attendant\nrisks. Thankfully, none of this is holding me back right now.\nReading: To distract myself pre-op, I  read a 600+ page book in the hospital! Thomas\nDoerr's new novel, _Cloud Cuckoo Land,_ was an excellent choice for me as, while\nconfronting the interlocking destinies of five characters everywhere from medieval\nConstantinople through the future, with forays into eco-terrorism, the Korean War, the\ntravails of a working class single mom in rural Idaho and more, the book was also (imo)\nabout the power of *storytelling* to stave off illness, death, current reality. While\nreferencing Eco and Borges, the ambitious novel had a Scheherazade, _1001 Nights_\nvibe! I stayed up late at night in the hospital reading, counting on the power of stories to\ntake me away...\n                    \nToday: Sammi nicely drove me to my PCP's this morning. We saw Dr. Damaske's PA,\nwent over all my medications. clarified wound care. The LpN (nurse) arrives tomorrow to\nassess me. Justin, Dr. Beddegowda, Mount Nittany etc. all in the loop (suture removal?\nradiation set up?). It's calm here and I'm trying to rest (very tired). Sammi and Ben\ncontinue to take compassionate care of me; Ethan following me closely from NY and\nmaking useful suggestions.\nBe well, everyone.",

The return -- with lightning speed -- of your characteristic clarity, empathy, wit,\nprecision, insight, humor, and optimism, especially following a life event such as brain\nsurgery, was miraculous. I'm sure all the prayers from the many people who love you\nmade an impact in addition to the outstanding neurosurgeon and team of stellar\nhealthcare providers. I hope you continue -- for a long time -- to enjoy the quality of life\nthat you deserve and so very much appreciate. I love you and send you warm hugs,\nHarriet\n  \u2014Harriet Jackson, February 1, 2022  \nI'm a bit in awe of how many similarities there are in our lives, Willa. Aside from the age\ndifference, me being so much older than you, we've shared quite a few experiences,\nespecially our love of France. We both did that, 'independence,' route. And now we both\nhave a battle on our hands with thoughts of mortality etc. Rest peacefully at home and\nenjoy each day for the goodness it brings.

We were in a restaurant whose name I should\nremember (it was maybe two people's names?) but don't with the sense that all eyes\nwere on us, and were creating a dialogue about what the local folk might be saying\nabout \"the Jews\" being in town. I am reminded of your inexplicable (to me) obsession\nwith all things Amish and hokey in central PA. It's funny how central PA has become such\na home, but then, that's about the people there.

    "entry": "Things are moving forward. I am gathering strength, resting a lot, trying to recreate my\nnatural biorhythms (while hardly sleeping at all last night...!).\n*My head sutures will be removed next week, in town (Dr. Bettegowda at Hopkins is fine\nwith this, and it will save me multiple tiring trips to Baltimore);\n*I will see a radiation oncologist, also locally, in a week; I'm still in a 'healing phase' and\nwe await a final pathology report from JH. Dr. Bettegowda is also fine with my staying\nlocal; a blessing. At that point, a 'radiation plan' will be established. I know very little\nabout radiation, how it will affect me. I hope it won't be any more or less taxing than\nchemo. The goal is to irradiate the mets Dr. Bettegowda was unable to get out and keep\nthe cancer in check.  *Dr. Beavis called me yesterday late afternoon and we spoke for\nabout an hour. This was incredibly comforting. She's clearly thinking ahead to restarting\nchemo for my OC (the ultimate source of all this trouble), but not before the end of the\nmonth at the earliest. Meanwhile, she will test my new tumors to see which treatments\nmight be preferable. I'm now off the clinical trial, unfortunately, because of the new brain\nfindings, but may be eligible for other trials. We will likely stay on Taxol. It is possible\nthat I'll try Avastin, which sounded like it had a potentially scary side effect; but as my\nown situation becomes a bit more risky, Avastin becomes a more realistic option. This\n(timetable, plan) will all need to be coordinated with the radiation oncologist (also Dr.\nPatel) and my medical oncologist here, Dr. Patel. But first things first. I'll go to JH to see\nDr. Beavis at end of the month. We had such a good chat; she encouraged me to stay\nfocused on the positives (I came through surgery very well, sound really strong etc.). She\nfilled me in on some details about my arrival by helicopter at JH, when she, Dr. Schneider\n                    \nand others were crowding into my room, waiting for me. She's quite content for me to\nrest this week. She sounded relieved.\n*Spent 2+ hours earlier this week with RN sent by nursing agency. Karen was kind and\nthorough, did intake, checked my vitals, got me ready for PT and OT appointments next\nweek. I'll receive five weeks of each, perhaps weekly, covered by insurance. Still hoping\nfor a little help around the house, although my cleaner's coming next week. I get tired\nand am not 100% steady on my feet.\n*Received delicious meals from kind friends who I asked specifically to cook for me.\nThank you, Tamar, Helen, Deb and Tony, Kathryn and John and likely others!\n*Have been waited on hand and foot by Ben and Sammi: medication organization and\ndelivery, meal prep and clean up, errands, tasks around the house. Their calm, kind\npresence this past week has been a balm. Sammi is headed back to NY today while Ben\nstays a few more days. \n*Had my shower head entirely replaced by the awesome 'Rosie the Riveter' aka Maria,\nwho is both an expert plumber (who knew?) *and* an expert on modern Italian kid lit!\n*Am enjoying a two month 'coda' in my year marked by the number '4' and that seems\nto carry a good energy with it: today is my friend Monique's birthday (2/4), next month is\nmine (3/4), then Ben's (4/4) and Michael's comes between mine and Ben's (2/24). The\nnatural world will change much between February and April. Due to the gloomy, icy\nweather today, with town and campus basically shut down, I am cozily observing it from\nmy pretty sunroom, with its big bay windows turned towards outside.\nAnd so, while my world has been somewhat upended and my life expectancy potentially\ncut short, I am feeling preternaturally calm and content. Strange, eh?  I hardly slept, but\nmy body was still and relaxed. I planned out a modest bday party for myself and pretty\nmuch wrote this blog in my head. On to a few bills (there are many....). Must get off my\nsocial media devices at night. Ben ordered a new reading lamp for me and I plan to\nreplace those wasteful bedtime hours with more reading every night -- Whitehead,\nShteyngart....\nBe well, everyone.",

    "entry": "Things are moving forward. All in all, it's been a pretty good week. Here are some\nupdates:\nMonday (2/7): Ben and I had a bit of an emotional parting. I started to get anxious about\n                    \nhow I would fare on my own, as did he, despite his herculean efforts to set everything up\nexpertly for me (meds, appointments etc.). He and Sammi took incredible care of me for\na week (I was so happy to send them heart-shaped boxes of Jacques Torres truffles as a\nmodest thank you). We worked through our tears and anxieties and got to a better place\nbefore Michael came to pick Ben up for lunch and then take him to the Megabus.\nIt turns out I've been fine. Shortly after Ben left, I worked with my therapist (online) and\npart of what I got out of it was a revised attitude towards my sleeping, realizing that I do\nnot, in fact, need to be awake through the night to maximize my time (terribly\ncounterproductive as I'm usually tired the next day). Yet, the thoughts keep coming as I\ndrift in and out of galaxies. My friend Maria came by later to deliver unsweetened\ncranberry juice for a minor UTI that, thankfully, now seems to be resolved with a few\ndays of antibiotics. And there was a lot of couch resting and snoozing.\nTuesday (2/8): A locksmith came in the morning to rekey my doors, which I felt\nnecessary. Later, the LpN came by, just to take vitals. From 4-6 a very nice woman\nnamed Abbye was here; she's a local woman who does errands, tasks around the house,\nthings I might be too tired to do right now. She washed my dishes, made my bed, ran a\nbunch of errands for me (dry cleaners, framing shop, Ulta). She's sort of the 'missing link'\nin terms of my care right now, and is extremely helpful. Lots of couch resting and\nsnoozing.\nWednesday (2/9): My house was thoroughly cleaned by my two house cleaners and is\ngetting back to being a very calm, hospitable environment. That took a few hours. In the\nafternoon, someone from PT came and we did some exercises. I am doing very well on\nthat front, don't even use a walker, use a cane sometimes when I go out. I lack some\nstrength but am working on it (sorta). I am also throwing out/purging/paring as much as I\ncan from my house; it's time. Ben and I threw away three massive boxes of my class\nnotes and I've finally gotten the top of my desk all clear. This will continue; it's crucial to\nmy sanity. Lots of resting and snoozing in my sunroom, so peaceful.\nOne day (I forget which), Isabelle and Vinni, my dear grad school friends, sent me four\n*pints* of the most delicious ice cream packed in dry ice, from a place in Maine called\nRococo (self-indulgent ice cream as its name suggests). Maine Whoopie Pie, Cardamom\nChai, Pear Caramelized Ginger (my favorite) and Goat Cheese Blueberry Chambord are\nall heavenly! So sweet and thoughtful of them; they were encouraging me to eat ice\ncream for breakfast, too!\nThursday (2/10): OT came for a visit. Two takeaways were a)to buy a foam mat for my\nbathroom that depresses with my footprints and does not move around when I exit the\nshower (which I'm able to do) and b)keep bowls and dishes I need at a handy reach\n(currently not the case). Later that afternoon, Abbye came over for about two hours and\ndid more errands and tasks for me (changing the water in my flowers, the vases are\n                    \nheavy etc.). Lots of resting in my sunroom. Ben and I had cooked all my meals for the\nweek (a pot roast with udon noodles, corn, broccoli and Thai-ish bbq sauce; butternut\nsquash; butternut squash soup etc.) so I was set on that front. Taking many meds\nthroughout the day, including the last of the Oxycodone for pain and a tapering down\nsteroid, Decadron.\nThursday (I think) my friend Deb Guerrero brought me lots of goodies from my\nhometown! These included 'viennoiseries' from a bakery across from her place in\nChelsea; a Breads Bakery babka (the grail...); two Breads Bakery loaf cakes (to be shared\non my birthday) *and* a lasagna from her husband Tony, who is a great cook (I had it\nlast night; very tasty indeed). Deb and I drove to NY together not too long ago and we\nhave kids around the same age. I hope we'll be able to do that again sometime; we had\nfun.\nTo be continued now  - this link is acting up....",

    "entry": "Friday (2/11): two-hour consult with radiation oncology at MNMC (the hospital), with a\nnice nurse and then the very young radiation oncologist, Dr. Veejay Patel (no relation). I\ndid not come away entirely happy, and tomorrow and Monday I need to get to emails,\nlikely with Dr. Bettegowda at Hopkins, Dr. Beavis and perhaps Dr. (Nilesh) Patel.\nEverything with the nurse was fine: we reviewed my meds, went over the procedure for\nradiation. This coming Monday I'll have a CT scan at the hospital; then it will take about\n7-10 days for the oncologist and physicist (!) to read and study the images, make a\nmodel (I think) and work out the details of my plan (schedule, duration, targeted\nlocations etc.). The nurse showed me a positively medieval, Monty-Pythonesque looking\nmesh helmet that I have to wear and that then gets bolted into another surface during\nradiation. The better news is that the radiation treatments are fairly short, nothing like\nthe 30 mn or so I needed to hold still during MRIs. These treatments, it seems, are more\nlike a few minutes. Potential side effects; hair loss (done deal already), nausea and\nvomiting, fatigue; skin rashes, burns; etc. Nothing I haven't contended with before (other\nthan the skin issues).\nWhat annoyed me is lack of consultation/coordination among my doctors, specifically\nbetween Dr. V. Patel and the others. He told me what he wanted to do for me and what\nhe planned to do but I made him assure me that he would talk to Dr. Bettegowda first.\nFrankly, I thought that a different set of mets needed to be radiated than the ones he\nproposed but I could be wrong; obviously, we all need to be on the same page about\nthis. And I am hoping he has read my file very carefully (at one point, he alluded to it\nbeing very 'thick' but I am worried that he hasn't read it carefully). *He* asked *me* if I\nwas supposed to get full brain radiation -- dear God... Also, they do not use gamma knife\ntechnology at MNMC, which I know to be quite cutting edge (pun intended?). Part of me\nwants to bag MNMC and be treated at Hopkins, but there is a real advantage in my\nreceiving treatment here, not having to make 7 hour round trips to Baltimore; being able\nto be in my home, near my friends, in my comfort zone. Dr. Bettegowda was fine with\nme being treated here in State College -- as long as the treatment is good (of course\nthey do this all the time at MNMC but I am anxious).\n[In all honesty, what Dr. V. Patel described as treatment did not sound that bad: 3-5\ntreatments (but there again I thought that contradicted what I had been told], a good\nprognosis (but how does that jive with my life expectancy?). Maybe I'm so used to\narduous treatments that I'm surprised this seems so 'lite.' I'm confused and need more\ninfo, which I'll get. :(\nSo voil\u00e0. I am letting things 'sit' as nothing happens over the weekend, Dr. V. Patel said\nhe'd be in touch with Dr. Bettegowda and I currently feel ok (sleep still a bit wonky, but\nimproving) Tomorrow I'll start crafting emails. Dr. Beavis can always 'quarterback' for me\neven if she's not a neurologist. I worked a lot of this plan out with my trusted  and kind\n                    \nfriend Jackie, who was kind enough to drive me to both appointments yesterday, with a\ncappuccino stop in between. Needless to say, I needed this help! \nA bit unnerving. I came home and rested for a while. Then it was time to go to Gray's\nWoods to have my sutures removed by Dr. Damaske's nurse practitioner. This proceeded\nsmoothly and I'm glad to no longer have stitches (you can see my 'before' picture above\n- not for the faint of heart....). After the suture removal, I climbed into bed at home and\ntook a nap.\n****\nMaria is coming over in a while and we'll take a short jaunt into the country on this pretty\nday. Thanks too to Monique for the treats and to my friends Cheryl and Sandy (and Jon\nand Ron) for the opportunity to have a delicious Valentine's Day meal from the\nHummingbird Room tonight. I wish I could join you but need to be 'under wraps' at home\nfor just a few weeks more while I recover. And Mary, thank you for the MBB gift card! I\nam dreaming of fresh fish from Maine, which I will make with za'atar and preserved\nlemons (easy enough). And to everyone else for texts, emails, well wishes. I hope not to\nhave forgotten anyone. I am so grateful.\nI guess I'm progressing further into one of my nine lives (I actually don't think I've had\nthat many), this one as a cancer patient. Although I hate any thought of myself as an\n'invalid' (\"in-valid??\"), I do need to be a bit dependent right now.  And this new stage as\na cancer patient is simply...different than the previous ones. It's becoming somewhat\neasier for me to sit with the dichotomies and contradictions, the 'double lives' (doubles\nvies>W of the Perec novel's title).",

    "entry": "Because there was some concern about the confusion surrounding my radiation\ntreatment options, including seeming lack of coordination among members of my\nmedical team, here's a brief update:\nDrs. V. Patel and Bettegowda spoke by phone and I feel much better about things now.\nAt this point, I am leaning about 98% towards 3-5 stereotactic radiation treatments here\nin State College, mainly or exclusively directed at my cerebellum. The confusion over\nwhat to radiate stems from the fact that there is another tiny spot that *may or may not\nbe cancer* in my brain as opposed to what Dr. Patel called an 'artefact;' they will know\nmore once they study CT imaging I had done this morning at the hospital. Regarding\ngamma/cyberknife: according to Dr. Patel, there is *no data* indicating that\ngamma/cyberknife is a *better* technology; whether or not to have it available is an\ninstitutional choice. The technique he will use will accomplish the same thing, and he is\nhopeful that my cancer will not recur there (but one never knows, I suppose...). And then\nit will be back to chemo to treat my ovarian cancer: whee!! Dr. Bettegowda is completely\non the same page as Dr. Patel. So that's the plan. Full-brain radiation is not in the\npicture; it will be very directed. I had written to Dr. Beavis asking her to 'quarterback' for\nme, then walked that back a bit after my time at the hospital this morning. She's aware\nof the situation, though, and may insert herself into the conversation somehow. My last\nemail will likely be to Dr. Bettegowda (to whom I've already written a thank you note),\njust to make sure Dr. Patel's reporting was completely accurate. Each of these\ncommunications does take something out of me as I try to recuperate. Each is stressful\nbut as mentioned I feel considerably relieved now.\nThis morning I was at the hospital for a few hours for CT imaging and to have my\n'helmet' made in preparation for radiation. Initially, it felt like a lovely spa experience (or\nat least I imagined it so), with the warm plastic goop pressed into my face but then it\nbecame less fun. Please see the pics of the personalized Darth Vader helmet I'll be\nwearing during radiation, bolted into a table. Oy!\n \n \nPhotos",

A quick\ncomment, no matter the situation (positive or negative), can boost morale by 28.2%.\"\nTherefore, I'll add something that I hope fills the bill. (Where DO they get their\npercentages?). I'm trying to picture what you're going through, and, Wow! does it ever\nsound \"challenging\". So many doctors /cooks stirring the broth and you're left to make\nsure they're communicating clearly with each other (and YOU!).\nI can see how that would indeed take a lot out of you , especially when you're trying at\nthe same time to recover mentally and physically from brain surgery. I'm sure many\nwould just delegate the task to someone else (family? friend?). But that's a lot to pass on\nand beside, it would leave you hanging a bit as to whether the tying up of all loose ends\njob was complete (what IS going on with me, anyhow?). At least, you have the comfort of\nknowing all your practitioners are competent and desirous of doing the absolute best on\nyour behalf.\nHi five, you, managing getting through all this, and keeping us all in the loop too (don't\nthink many would be able to correspond in such depth right after brain surgery though I\nTHINK surgery on the cerebellum mostly affects the part of the brain responsible for\ncoordinating - well, coordination. It would be awful if it were either your language center\nor all the fancy jobs the right side has to oversee!\nAll I can add, is that I've had at least three possible cancer diagnoses rescinded because\n                    \nof \"artefacts\" in imaging.

    "date": "February 19, 2022",
    "entry": "Many thanks to all for your expressions of care and concern. Herewith, a few updates on\nthe week:\nTuesday (2/15) - My friend Martina was kind enough to take me to my routine\nmammogram appointment at Gray's Woods in the morning. Happy to report that that\nexam was normal, thankfully. Another cancer would have been a kick in the head (no\nwait, I already had that one...). Martina drove me to get a coffee after that and to CVS to\npick up a prescription. And we stopped by the liquor store so I could pick up a few items\nto share on my birthday (I am abstaining from alcohol these days; if my doctors ok it, I\nmight have a small glass of something on my bday). Abbye came by in the afternoon\nand ran some errands for me, which is a tremendous help. Frame shop to digitize old\nfamily photos etc....\nWednesday (2/16) - Physical therapy came in the morning and we did some exercises. I\nknow I should be grateful for weekly visits (which are almost over) from PT, OT and LpN,\nbut to be honest sometimes I find them disruptive (the therapists often call you on the\nday, wanting to come over shortly after that) and tedious, and I'm not too keen on the\ntherapists themselves.\nIn the afternoon, my friend Jessica drove me to Spectacles, in part to deal with a new\n                    \nproblem as I try valiantly to address various health kinks: I have an *ulcer* (!) on/in my\neye, which explains why my eye has felt very irritated and scratched recently. Dr.\nDamaske's PA had given me antibiotic drops for this but they did not help as this *open\nsore* on my eye needs to be treated like a virus (even though it's an infection). I now\nhave new drops that are helping but my eye is not yet fully better. I have already\nreturned to the optometrist once for her to check the eye and will return again on\nMonday. My eye is healing, but has not yet healed completely. It's truly annoying and\nuncomfortable, although I'm not letting it hinder me too much. I may also check in with\nthe ophthalmologist next week. Once the eye is healed, I'll proceed with getting my new\nprescription tweaked and filled, new frames etc. I hadn't seen the optician (Joseph, the\noptometrist Julie's husband) in a while. He's French (and Jewish, half-Ashkenazi half-\nSephardic as I recall, last name Haloua) and we always enjoyed chatting in French (this\nweek was no exception). After I filled him in on my cancer, he shared that he has\nepilepsy -- grand mal seizures - and we agreed that serious illness can lead to\nunexpected perspectives on just about everything.\nThursday (2/17): Stephanie, the occupational therapist, came by for a short while. She\ngave me some \"Thera-Putty\" akin to Silly Putty, which keeps my hands and fingers\nsupple. This is actually helpful as my hands had been cramping up while doing mundane\nchores like writing cards, putting on a necklace etc.\nFriday (2/18): It turned out to be a somewhat hectic day, by my current standards. I\nspent about two hours or so in the morning making soup (and standing the whole time),\nwhich I hadn't yet done since my surgery, and which did tire me out a bit, but not\nexcessively. But now I have a good week's worth of meals or supplements, so it was a\nworthwhile and enjoyable activity. I made harira, a North African/Middle Eastern\nvegetarian soup/stew that I'd made once before and that's very tasty and nutritious:\nonions, celery, carrots, crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, turmeric, cumin, salt, pepper,\nharissa spice (and paste), coriander, parsley, chick peas, lentils. I usually add more\nharissa paste and maybe a dollop of sour cream when I'm eating it and might serve with\na piece of crusty sourdough bread from the Bellefonte Bread Baker. Yum.\nBrian the physical therapist called and of course wanted to come over immediately. I\nforestalled him a bit before he came by, led me in some exercises, and then pretty much\nsigned me out in terms of further treatment with him. My optometrist called and wanted\nto look at my eye a few hours after that, so I set that up including ride etc. (thank you,\nJackie!). Abbye came by at 3:00, took my laptop to have a new battery installed (an\nimportant errand I haven't been able to get to) and to pick up four delicious fresh fish\nfillets from Maine Bay and Berry for me (thank you, Mary, for the gift certificate). For\ndinner, I baked a salmon fillet with za'atar and preserved lemon + asparagus + a\ndelicious potato pancake my friend Helen had picked up at a deli in CT when she was on\na business trip (thank you, Helen, and for the half-sours and the cappuccino at my\ndoorstep!). Abbye also washed some of the remaining soup making dishes, pots etc. and\n                    \nmade my bed. She's the essential 'missing link' in my care, at least for the next few\nweeks as I continue to gather strength.\nI also talked to my friend Clare and we planned a little outing for later today, to a\nconsignment store we both enjoy called \"Arcadian.\" Looks a bit gray and wintry out\nthere, but I am glad to be here!!!\nLast night I continued the Sidney Poitier films series I'm curating for myself; I really don't\nknow why I hadn't seen more of his films aside from \"To Sir, with Love\" (which I had seen\nseveral times). I fully understand now why he was so lauded at his death (and before);\nwhat an amazing actor. I was engrossed in all of these and can recommend (*****) them\nall: Lilies of the Field, A Patch of Blue, A Raisin in the Sun, To Sir, with Love, and In in the\nHeat of the Night. Anything else I should watch?\nOverall, I feel pretty well. I still need a lot of rest; my body gets tired, but I am sleeping\nbetter (although often in several 'chunks'). I am grateful for the reprieve as the doctors\ncontinue to study my brain imaging and work out my radiation plan. I expect radiation\nwill begin late this week or the beginning of the following. Once my radiation oncologist\nclears me, moreover, I need to get back to chemo, likely weekly Taxol (as before the\nbrain episode) for the time being. I am actually more concerned/nervous about the\nchemo than the radiation, but I'm putting it out of my mind for now. Basically, as my\nchemo treatment options become fewer, it is likely that they'll become slightly riskier.\nMore on that -- but not now. The sun just came out! And I'm off to shower, to have a bowl\nof harira, and to the consignment store.\nVery grateful thanks for all the generous 'acts of affirmation' this week (Paula for the\ndivine-smelling rose spa treatments; Melissa for the lovely card; Zia for the call and\nemail>I'll get back to you, especially after Ethan just ran into you on the UWS!; Heather\nfor the VDay card; Gay for the card; Mar for the tasty turkey chili). Please excuse me if I\nneglected to mention you personally here. Thank you to others for reading my blog,\nemails and texts etc. It helps me!!",

    "entry": "Please direct some good thoughts my way tomorrow (Wednesday) around 10 a.m. when\nI begin a new phase of my cancer journey: radiation. I will have five treatments: this\nWednesday and Friday, next Monday and Wednesday and perhaps Monday 7 March (I\nneed to reschedule, as I asked for a 'reprieve' on my birthday). Each appointment is\nshort; the first one will consist of a 'dry run' (rehearsal?), followed by radiation (30\nminutes total?), the remaining four will take even less time (perhaps 15 minutes). I have\nno idea how fatigued I'll be, if I'll have other side effects etc. I am eager for radiation to\nget underway. Yesterday, I felt a bit of the type of discomfort I was feeling from swelling\nin my head (yet nowhere near the head-splitting pain this became), but perhaps this is\njust phantom pain. My dear friend Jackie will take me tomorrow and next Monday, while\nkind neighbors the Matthiesens will transport me on Friday. I have another appointment\ntoo on Friday, with my PCP, which I need to arrange a ride to/from. When I return\ntomorrow, my home will be in the process of being cleaned (including my perennially\nmessy study, a huge victory as I've been purging lots of stuff). A very clean home will\nhelp a lot psychologically.\nMy radiation oncologist, Dr. Patel, continues not to inspire the utmost confidence. I\nbelieve this is due to his 'youth' and relative inexperience. When I spoke to him on the\nphone the other day, he led me to believe that what needs to be radiated in my\ncerebellum is still sizeable (\"not exactly huge, but not exactly small,\" was how he put it,\nmost inexactly). Imho, the early 40s of Drs. Beavis and Bettegowda (as far as I can tell) is\nthe sweet spot in terms of age. Dr. Patel the Younger also equivocated on when I should\nrestart chemo (I could hear hesitation in his voice), despite Dr. Beavis deferring to him\nfor this decision. He merely told me, hesitatingly, that he had a few patients undergoing\nchemo at the same time as radiation. Then Dr. Patel the Elder's scheduler called me to\narrange my chemo; it turns out that Drs. Beavis and Patel the Elder had already\n                    \nconferred and decided I should resume weekly Taxol as soon as radiation was finished. I\nopted for a slightly later appointment than I could have gotten, on March 16th, a)so I\ncould meet with Dr. Patel instead of his PA (who I also don't trust) prior to chemo and\nb)so I can recoup more energy post-radiation. I hope I can delay these extra few days\nwithout negative repercussions. Despite hiccups, things seem to be falling into place for\nthe next phase.\nIn better news, the ulcer on my eye appears to be healed but I need to use the drops for\nanother week. And today I'm generally feeling ok, having slept well in 'only' two chunks.\nAND I believe Dr. Bettegowda is clearing me to begin driving on Feb. 26th! I have to\nconfirm this. I think I'm ready for it, although I won't undertake anything ambitious, just\nsome short drives to appointments, around town etc.\nMy former colleague and buddy Jim Davis sent me the most delicious toffee (the\ncrunchy, buttery, non-gooey kind) from a place in Palm Springs that is known for it,\nBrandini. And my friend Scott gifted me a big slab of homemade carrot cake. I think a\nconspiracy may be afoot to fatten me, but I'm trying to eat as healthily as possible of my\nown accord, and look forward to a bowl of butternut squash soup for lunch.",

    "entry": "A brief update: everything seems to have gone smoothly this morning during my first\nradiation treatment. I was a bit anxious and slept so-so (perhaps 6-7 hours, in two\ninstallments, with some time for thinking in between). My very responsible friend Jackie\ndrove me and we wound up talking about the puzzles/word games we do to keep our\nminds sharp (I'm a NYTimes Spelling Bee and daily puzzle stalwart, and am dipping my\ntoes into Wordle, but it involves strategy, which I'm terrible at; a plus for the NYTimes\npuzzles, I have a large vocabulary); stuffed animals; and my pre-radiation anxiety. \nThe treatment itself was fairly short: 30 minutes all told? The sweat-inducing part was\nliterally being tightly *bolted* onto a table via the futuristic helmet made for me and\nbeing told that I must lie very still for fear of the radiation being misdirected. Two\ntechnicians conducted the procedure, yet Dr. Patel and The Physicist (an individual I\nknow only as The Physicist; being fairly scientifically illiterate, unfortunately, I don't know\nwhat she or he does, but I'm curious to find out!) were seated behind a barrier,\nsupervising (or assisting?). I was told to relax and think pleasant thoughts. I kept my\neyes closed and held as still as possible. Some 'good' easy listening music helped: James\nTaylor's \"Carolina in my mind\" (one of my favorite songs), a nice Simon and Garfunkel,\nHeart's \"These Dreams.\" Perhaps coordinated with all the prayers and well wishes\nheaded my way at 10 a.m., Queen also came on: \"We are the champions, my friend/And\nwe'll keep on fighting 'til the end!\"\nI was most concerned about which side effects I'd feel afterwards. So far I'm doing ok,\nrather worn out but unable to sleep so I'm writing. Very low-grade headache, but not\nbad. So far, no nausea, vomiting, or visible rashes. We'll see. Next treatment Friday\nmorning. My kind neighbors Pat and Denis Matthiesen are taking me. They seem\nundeterred by the \"wintry mix\" forecasted. My friend Clare will drive me to PCP\nappointment that afternoon, weather permitting. Then Jackie will accompany me again\non Monday. Helen and I have a little outing planned for Sunday, in Bellefonte, which I\nlook forward to.\nAfter treatment today, Jacke drove to Lemont so that we could get coffee at Caf\u00e9\n                    \nLemont, a latte for her, a cappuccino with a shot of almond syrup for me, reminiscent of\nthe steamed whole milk with syrup I drank every evening during my last trimester of\npregnancy, and which contributed to my packing on 70 pounds (I lost most of it, and Ben\nwas worth every kilo!). Caf\u00e9 Lemont's coffee is the best in town, imo.\nI'm picking up from a few comments that maybe I'm being too hard on Dr. Patel the\nYounger. I will give him the benefit of the doubt; I need to trust him. But I also need to\nadvocate for myself. Contradictory aims. I am eager to speak with him again.",

    "entry": "Radiation appeared to go smoothly yesterday. The only blip came in the form of a  phone\ncall in the morning asking if I wanted to shift my appointment to the afternoon, due to\ninclement weather that shut our town and campus down for the day. So I moved my\n                    \nmorning appointment to 3:15, forcing me to also shift my afternoon PCP appointment to\nanother day, as yet unidentified (my PCP does not have openings before July! I'm\nworking on this with scheduling). In any case, treatment was more crucial than the\nrelatively routine follow-up appointment with Dr. Damaske (for whom I do have\nquestions, though, including about when I might have a shingles vaccine).\nMy helmet-like contraption is bolted so tightly into the table that I was afraid my teeth\nwould pop out, so firmly are they held in place by a mouth guard! I asked the technicians\n(two very nice women) to let me know when 15-10-5 minutes remained; this is helpful.\nOtherwise, I close my eyes and listen to \"hits from the 60s, 70s and 80s\" -- yesterday,\nJim Croce, \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,\" Marvin Gaye, \"What's Goin' On?,\" Fleetwood Mac,\n\"Go your own way,\" the Eagles. I calculate that each song lasts about three minutes; that\nmeans five songs or more per treatment, each lasting 15-30 minutes. During that time,\neyes shut, I hear whirring and buzzing when the radiation is actually directed at my\ncerebellum, feel the table rock slightly to secure me into position, smell a singing,\nburning odor at one point (unpleasant), and lie still throughout, crick in my neck be\ndamned. Dr. Patel and \"The Physicist\" (whose name, I recently learned, is Neil) sit in a\ncontrol room behind a window, overseeing the treatment (the radiation machine is\nactually programmed to deliver the radiation on its own, according to my individualized\nradiation plan).\nNo more than 30 minutes and not bad. When I told the technicians that my side effects\nso far were minimal, they found that unsurprising as only a small area is being radiated\n(as opposed to, say, an entire abdomen). This contradicts somewhat Dr. Patel the\nYounger's assessment of my tumor as \"not exactly big but not exactly small\" so I'm\ngetting to treatment a bit early on Monday to talk to him about how treatment is going.\nMy neighbor, Denis Matthiesen, drove me to treatment. Nice man, nice neighbor in his\n70s (?), who lives with his wife, Pat (second marriage for each), across the road from me.\nFrom Queens (and has the accent to prove it!), devout practicing Catholic, Democratic\nvoter (father a lieutenant in the fire department who died of cancer resulting from\nfighting fires). Flirtatious to the point of making me a bit uncomfortable at times, but\nnothing untoward so far other than a friendly pat on the shoulder (and I know how to\ndeflect). Monday I'll be with my stalwart pal, Jackie, and Wednesday with another\nstalwart pal, Maria. Denis drove me to get a cappuccino after treatment, warming\ncomfort in a cup.\nI slept miserably last night, but I'm ok. I had taken my steroid later in the day because of\nthe later appointment, and that can cause insomnia, plus I had ingested caffeine 4-5\np.m. Mistakes. I do know how to shut my brain off at night and focus on my music\n(Tibetan bowls, chanting, thunder storms, waves) but somehow my brain was stubborn.\nSo I was galaxy-hopping again.\n                    \nAt first I was shaken by events in Ukraine, grief-stricken for the civilians, impressed by\nthe courageous resistance of the Ukrainians, fearful that this is yet another 'canary in the\ncoal mine' harbinger of the blows against (end of??) democracy, thinking of the late\n1930s (Munich, Anschluss) (even earlier, centuries earlier) and the power of autocrats,\nbut in a vastly different, globalized and interconnected world. Somehow, these anxieties\nmerged with my own interest in genealogy -- we come from that part of the world\n(Belarus, Lithuania, about whose history I am realizing I need to know more) -- and I\nwondered if Ben would like a narrative account of our family's history. So I pretty much\nwrote part of it in my head, relying on some of the documents I have uncovered on\ngenealogy sites. Of course, the further back you go with Jewish genealogy, the harder it\nbecomes to trace, similar to the genealogy of former slaves. Scratch the surface and you\ncome up against the Holocaust, with at least one of my great-grandmother's sisters\ndeported to a camp in Russia. I'll do more digging.\nThen I was was micro-managing a gathering I'm having on my birthday (the 4th),\n'making my lists and checking them twice,' ensuring that we'll be well provisioned.\nNext I was back to the idea of turning my Caring Bridge journal into a performance piece,\ntowards which I'm leaning more heavily recently, especially since my therapist and I\ndiscussed how it might be of help to some others, as they have told me my journal is.\nThis idea is particularly appealing, relieving some of the focus on me and the\nparticularities of my journey. I also have a partial play list in mind to accompany the\npiece, and a wonderful local musician on board to sing/play guitar. I'm in the process of\ncutting and pasting the journal into something resembling a book (several hundred\npages so far), and then I'll be moving on to editing, cleaning up, and seeing what I can\ndo with this behemoth (performance would be both live at my house and live streamed\nand other voices would add to mine in the form of the hundreds of comments people\nhave left, of which I'd choose a modest selection).\nFinally, I was revisiting the fun photo shoot my friend, the photographer St\u00e9phane Cojot-\nGoldberg, and I joined forces for in Paris in 2019 when I needed some professional shots.\nI'd like to do this again with St\u00e9phane on my next Paris trip, with some different locales\nfeatured (the Pont des Arts w/the Institut in the background would be nice, and maybe\nl'As du Falafel in the rue des Rosiers could be fun along with other sites in the Marais)\nand as long as St\u00e9phane is feeling well enough from his recurrence of and treatment for\nleukemia. I'm envisioning some bald shots, different wigs, different outfits. That was\nabout 3:30 a.m. I think I finally drifted to sleep around 4 a.m. and awoke at 8:00 a.m. My\n'carer' Abbye brought me a delicious cappuccino so I'm doing alright, just feel like I have\nsome cotton balls stuffed inside my head. Luckily, I can rest today and am eyeing my\ncouch already. Reading's in store, and some house straightening, work on my journal,\nmaybe some Vever work (to which I returned this week!). Maybe a nap. I look forward to\nlunch with my dear friend Helen tomorrow in Bellefonte (Bonfatto's), followed by a stop\nat a newish market that sells local products, including local pickles (an obsession of the\n                    \npast two years) with a lot of spice and snap!\nBe well, everyone. Happy 18th birthday to my dear nephew, Isaac. Sorry I can't be in the\ncity for the festivities as I continue to gather my strength. Hope Ben and Sammi continue\nto have fun skiing in Stowe, Vermont, in preparation for their Colorado ski trip.",

    "entry": "Radiation went smoothly yesterday. Happy to report minimal side effects, beyond some\nfatigue. Took about 20 minutes. I had requested to speak to Dr. Patel the Younger before\nmy treatment. I'm feeling better about him now, just as I warmed up to Dr. Patel the\nElder after a rocky start. Veejay Patel confirmed that treatment was going well, that the\ntumor had shrunk considerably (from about a 5 cm size...), that it was fine for me to\nhave a drink on my birthday, that it was fine for me to restart weekly chemo with Taxol\non 3/16, that the likelihood of my having a stroke or other major neuro event was low as\nthose affect a different part of the brain (the cerebrum) than the one we are treating etc.\nSince then I've thought of additional questions that I will ask him at visit #5. I'm just glad\nthat radiation is going smoothly and that I feel generally well.\nJackie was kind enough to provide a ride and we had a good chat. After treatment, I\nheaded to my former Dean's house to drop off some homemade butternut squash bisque\nfor her (she's a cancer survivor as well). Then we headed to Pump Station for my ritual\npost-treatment cappuccino, and ended up in Jackie's car in my driveway having a good\ntalk about some challenges arising from a situation involving Jackie's sister and her\nfamily in Germany. When I returned home around noon, I lay on the couch for a while\nand finished my book (_Sag Harbor,_ an early Colson Whitehead novel; he writes\ncaptivatingly, in this case in a teenage, middle-class Black boy's vernacular, but the\nnovel has no plot; it ambles along, like the boys' summer at the beach in Long Island,\nand that gets tedious after a while. I'm not sure I'd recommend the novel but I wouldn't\ndissuade you from reading it either. May move on to Gary Shteyngart next).\nI had bad insomnia again last night! That was unexpected. The previous night I had slept\nwell. I likely made the mistake of (re)watching, shortly before bed, a documentary called\n_End Game,_ focusing in part on terminal patients and the kinds of decisions they face\n(this was *after* watching the very worrisome news reports from Ukraine). Some of\nthese patients are being cared for at the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco, founded\n                    \nby the man who's become my guru for all things End of Life, the physician and palliative\ncare/hospice care authority, B.J. Miller. As always, B.J. had some compelling things to say\nabout death (that it fosters \"love, connection\" and something else I can't remember; and\n\"from what I've seen, what happens after we die ain't all that bad\"). He encourages\nhonoring each patient who dies at Zen Hospice Project by covering their shroud or coffin\nwith flowers, thereby marrying moments of grief with simplicity and beauty. This gave\nme a lot of ideas, much to think about. Plus B.J. is hot, a truly beautiful man in his fifties,\nwho lost parts of three limbs in a college accident in which he was electrocuted at 19\nwhile goofing off on top of a train car at Princeton U. I need to soon rewatch his popular\nTED Talk, \"What Really Matters at the End of Life,\" read some of his writings, and\nperhaps find out more about another service he founded, Mettle Health.\nB.J. Miller encourages \"cultivating a relationship with death.\" But this is such a challenge\nwhen one is enamored of life, as I am. Part of my problem is that once the issue of\nlifespan was presented to me, I started to become very anxious. Dr. Beavis, whom I trust\ncompletely, said it could be as short as six months (!!) while Dr. Frader, the head of\nKGOS (Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service at Hopkins) told me she had a patient with\nmy profile (OC then brain mets) who lived for ten years. Dr. (Nilesh) Patel, in my last\nconvo with him, refuses to pronounces on lifespan, deeming each case highly\nindividualized. Having gotten over the initial shock about these varied predictions, I need\nto query Dr. Beavis further about how she thinks this will all go down: we run out of\ntreatment options? I develop some sort of complication? I run out of steam? I simply\nconform to the overall odds of 50% of OC patients making it five years? How can I\npossibly be feeling so good and full of life now and have six months to live? (Dr. Beavis\ndid say that her prediction tended towards the 'two years' side of the equation and of\ncourse there are 'outliers'). Well, I guess at this point I always come back to the idea of\nembracing every day, hour, moment, second and trying to live 'in the moment.' Another\nchallenge, especially for someone like me, drawn as strongly towards past (nostalgia,\nmemory) and future (plans, dreams, hopes) as to the present.\nJust to put it out there: I do understand that, for all of us, \"none of our tomorrows is\nguaranteed\" but let us concede  that this is a more pressing, germane, and 'real' issue\nfor advanced cancer patients such as myself.\nI also want to get a better sense of why I saw a palliative care doc at Hopkins, which at\nfirst I confused with a hospice doc (it is not!). From what I understood, palliative care\ncoordinates all the different strands of a patient's care (not just medical but also\nspiritual, emotional etc.). From B.J's documentary, though, it seemed as if palliative care\nwas a sort of transitional step, anticipating (even at a far remove) end of life care in\nsome way. That idea jolted me a bit. I'm either in denial or not understanding something\ncorrectly.\nA college classmate, Nancy Audesse, died a few days ago, of throat cancer. I didn't know\n                    \nher in college, but she seemed an exceptionally brave, clear-sighted soul. When about\nfifteen of us classmates gathered at Lisa Peters Driver's funeral a few years ago, Nancy\npaid for dinner for all of us, somehow wanting to honor the beauty of that moment and\nthe warm connections we all formed and furthered in the wake of Lisa's death. At that\ndinner, wheelchair-bound Nancy -- recovering from a massive stroke and several bouts\nof cancer -- was cared for lovingly by David, another college classmate whom she had\nnot known prior but with whom she was cultivating a budding romance! Both Nancy and\nDavid had lost long-time partners w/whom they had had loving relationships. They\nmarried shortly afterwards and enjoyed several years of marriage, despite (or because\nof?) Nancy's illness. A beautiful love story.\nThat close-by 'whoosh' of death always unnerves me some -- \"it tolls for thee\" -- although\nI'm feeling well overall (despite insomnia) and very much looking forward to my bday on\nFriday. In my sleepless state last night, I was fretting about the effect of pressure in air\nplanes on my brain (yes, I have the travel bug again) and what I would need to tell TSA\nabout the titanium bolt in my head while going through pre-check.\nBut today the sun is shining. I've just received a box of luscious pears from Harry and\nDavid (don't know who they are from yet, but thank you!), an eye-catching beaded\ndragonfly purse from Jane, with a box of 'schmear' (nova, bagels and lox) to come - what\na treat!; and an iconic Jo Malone shopping bag from my mother, undoubtedly containing\nthe very divine-smelling gift I was going to offer myself (or something similar)! Will wait\nuntil Friday for the big reveal. My mother has never gotten my tastes wrong, in 63 years!\nSo much love. I'm a lucky girl. Be well, everyone.",

Also so important that you feel better about Dr. Patel the Younger. So\nimportant to feel confident about your doctors. I also hear you (due to experiences with\nthose close to me, but different for everyone) that indeed the proverbial \u00ab none of our\ntomorrows are guaranteed \u00bb is certainly more \u00ab germane \u00bb as you stated, in this\nsituation.

    "entry": "A brief note to say that radiation went well yesterday; last treatment will be on Monday! I\nhave had practically no ill effects except fatigue. I slept well the night before, Maria\n                    \npicked me up and we were able to gab a bit, treatment took 20 minutes, and then we\nwere on to Caf\u00e9 Lemont to pick up the cappuccinos. I rested for about an hour when I got\nhome, ate lunch (harira soup/stew; very nourishing) and then was able to work at my\ndesk for the rest of the day. I look forward to asking more questions and receiving an\nupdate on Monday. Then back to weekly chemo on the 16th - ugh. Dr. Beavis and I have\nexchanged emails and will talk by phone or videoconference sometime soon about the\nplan going forward. I'll see Dr. Patel (Nilesh) on the 16th, before treatment. I feel well\noverall. After a nurse comes to check my incision, my nice neighbor Janis will drive me to\nCaf\u00e9 Lemont to get a coffee (which I'll be able to do myself as of next Wednesday!).\nLike everyone, I'm distraught about events in Ukraine. How can so much love, caring,\nconcern and respect, such as I've been shown, coexist with such misery, wanton\ndisregard for civilian life, disrespect for the rights of sovereign states, murderous, power-\ngreedy intents and autocratic desires (bolstered by nuclear power)? And the bravery of\nthe Ukranian people, and the many Russians against the war, and others, throughout it\nall... I know that comparing my situation as a cancer patient and the complexities of\npolitics, geopolitics, history etc. is sort of ridiculous and I'm a hopeless Polyanna, but\nstill... So worrisome. People, our young people, must understand the history (yet also the\nnovelty of this situation in a globalized context). I awoke about 6:30 today and found\nmyself scrolling through videos of human suffering, Ukrainians walking miles to reach\nborder safety, families sleeping in subway stations, children receiving chemo in a kids'\nhospital in Kyiv... Regular people, like you and me. What will happen? It won't be good.\nHow can we help? I've given to International Red Cross and Jos\u00e9 Andres' World Central\nKitchen (nominate that man for a Nobel Peace Prize, immediately). But what else, when\nour own government (rightly, for now, in my view - that nuclear trigger, again) won't put\nboots on the ground but is doing everything it can (I think?) through NATO. CaringBridge\nis not the forum for this discussion (yet again, maybe it is: health and *caring*), I know,\nbut please pray that the situation resolves peacefully. It's so upsetting, yet of course this\nawful disregard for human rights is not unique to Ukraine...",
    "comments": "Elated that you\u2019re doing well, Willa! A bright light in the midst of despair for what's\nhappening in Europe.\nI wish all those who dared compare the American left to Soviet-style communism would\nlearn a dark lesson from the tragedy of Ukraine.\n  \u2014Monique Yaari, March 3, 2022  \nI wish that too in the face of such comparisons. And to think this was the great anti-\nfascist, anti-Hitlerian, liberating army once. \"Tout commence en mystique et finit en\npolitique,\" n'est-ce pas? p.s. How much of this do you think is motivated by anti-\n                    \nSemitism, or am I being paranoid? (Babi Yar bombing, Zelenskyy)\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 3, 2022  \nI forgot to add something. I found it very odd that the idea of wiping down the interior of\nmy mask with an alcohol wipe or something similar between treatments really surprised\nthe technicians. When I said, after my treatment, \"You do wipe down the interior of the\nmask afterwards, don't you?\" and they responded, \"No, we usually don't, but it's a good\nidea. Maybe we'll mention it and it will become the standard of care here,\" I was fairly\nstunned. That mask (inside) is covered with my sweat, oral bacteria etc. YUCK! It would\ncertainly behoove them to wipe it down for me as someone who is immunocompromised.\nApparently, there are other types of mouth guards that they do wipe down, but still...!\nHope I'm not being a curmudgeon here, but I was not pleasantly surprised by that news!\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 3, 2022  \nI'm thrilled you are well. I had a good dream about you the other night. You might\nwant to suggest the \"wipe down\" at a higher level.

    "entry": "This morning I had the last of my five radiation treatments, and all went smoothly. The\ntechnicians asked me if I wanted to *keep* that hideous Monty Python mask as a\n'souvenir' (?). No thank you very much, the few pictures I snapped of it will probably do\nfor a lifetime... They gave me a 'joke' diploma (again: lol) to confirm that I had completed\nthe \"the prescribed course of radiation therapy\" \"with the highest degree of courage,\ndetermination and good nature.\" Heehee. Then, I met with the nurse, PA (who kept\naddressing me as \"Wilma\" or \"Willow), and finally Dr. Patel. We once again seemed to\nhave some misunderstanding about the spots that were to be radiated (I'm sure he\nradiated the right spot -- post-surgical radiation -- especially as he was basing much of\nwhat he was doing on imaging -- but I may write to Dr. Bettegowda to be ultra-sure and\nto assuage anxiety that I'm sure is at play here). He confirmed that all went well, that he\nestimates there's a 15% chance of my brain cancer recurring, that I'll have an MRI in\nthree months unless I become symptomatic before that (worsening headaches, vision\ntroubles etc.), that there's really nothing much else for me to do as far as radiation goes.\nThe entire visit took about an hour. Jackie was kind enough to take me/pick me up and\nas usual we managed to get in both a good conversation and a cappuccino at Caf\u00e9\nLemont (with thanks to the \"cappuccino fairies,\" Kathryn and Isabelle!). I rested and read\nfor a while when I returned home, and was then at my desk the entire afternoon, happily.\nWeekly chemo (Taxol) will start up again, here, next week. I hope to speak with Dr.\nBeavis soon about the treatment plan going forward, and about whether there might be\nany clinical trials for me to enroll in. The effects of not having had chemo in so long while\nwe dealt with the brain issue (quite a detour!) are unclear to me. Thank goodness my\nlast OC scan, benefitting from the clinical trial, was stable.\nI'm reading a good book: _The Beauty of Dusk,_ by Frank Bruni, which recounts the\nstruggles of this former NYTimes restaurant critic and current op-ed columnist with\nsudden near blindness brought on by a stroke. It's a book about learning to make\nadjustments, to live with uncertainty, to find open doors to compensate for the closed\nones. One takeaway I like is the importance of humor in these totally eccentric,\nunprecedented situations (Monty Python plastic helmet, anyone?). Bruni writes very\nnicely so it's an engaging read, and I'm ripping through it. \nVery much looking forward to my mother coming to visit next week! I will be glad for the\ncompany.\nI had a lovely birthday. The whole day was punctuated by greetings from friends and\nfamily near and far -- texts, emails, FB messages, cards and gifts, a gorgeous bouquet, a\ndonation to Jos\u00e9 Andres' World Central Kitchen in my name, phone calls. Each one\nbrought a smile to my face. I am trying to respond to each in some fashion (have\nresponded to all the texts). Please bear with me. I am so appreciative of the well wishes\n                    \nand attention and outpouring of caring!\nI also spent the day 'beautifying' my home for a gathering of about 20 local friends who\nhave been particularly kind and helpful over the past several years, throughout my\nhealth ordeal, and who have never shied away from getting 'down and dirty' with me\nwhen the going got tough. Again, I felt so blessed to receive this help and kind, non-\npitying connection when *I really needed it.* So the party was meant both to thank all\nthese wonderful folks (only two could not attend) and to celebrate. Everyone seemed to\nhave a blast; I think we were all happy to enjoy some maskless socializing (we all tested\nbeforehand and no one fell ill) after so many Covid restrictions and self-restrictions. We\nall seemed to enjoy, as well, putting on our 'party clothes' after months in yoga and\nsweat pants in front of Zoom. Therefore, I put quite a bit of thought into my outfit,\nordering a new 'party dress' (on sale) from my favorite Parisian clothier (Anne-Elisabeth),\nbuying some new makeup (my favorite sales guy at Ulta, Josh, the one who wears drag\nshow makeup and is himself immersed in drag culture), helped me pick out a bright pink\nMac lipstick, shimmery pale pink nail polish from OPI (called \"Princesses Rule!\"), fake\neyelashes (for the first time *ever;* just felt like trying them as I'm hairless now), and an\neyebrow enhancer. I teased my newer wig so it looked quite nice and wavy. I wore the\nperfume from my mom, Jo Malone's Sambac and Marigold, which is divine and which I\nwould have bought myself. I truly did look well and happy; as it happened, I felt well that\nday and was certainly happy to be surrounded by friends all enjoying the celebration. I\nprepared a 'groaning' dessert table with both savory (cheeses, p\u00e2t\u00e9, sausage) and sweet\ntreats (cake, chocolate strawberries, homemade Tahini cookies, lemon cake from Breads\nBakery in NY, candy, fruit salad w/homemade whipped cream etc.), wines, liqueurs etc.\nCake, from a fairly new local baker (The Cakeshop by Tati) was extraordinary, and lots of\npeople photographed it before I cut it. I was glad for the opportunity for folks to meet\nthose they didn't know. Helen and Greg, off to Paris the next day, came over a bit early\nto help me set up while the amazing Maria (with some help from her Greg) cleaned up\nfor me as I was starting to flag.\nEveryone told me how good I looked. I wish that correlated with prognosis. While near\ndeath *does* look, well, near death, per Dr. Beavis, I know that my outward appearance\nis to some extent misleading. Even Dr. Beavis once said: \"It's surprising, you could cross\nthe path of someone very ill w/cancer in the grocery store and have no idea anything\nwas wrong.\" I do want readers to hold onto this lest I be accused of 'false advertising' in\nany way. Clearly the OC/brain cancer double whammy is not an ideal scenario. *But* I\nwas happy to dress up in my party dress + new makeup (w/great pink faux pearl\ndangling cocktail earrings to match!) and revel in the celebration. Every day a blessing.\nAnd I made it to 63!\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Now that radiation is finished it's back to chemo for the ovarian cancer, after a hiatus of\nwell over a month as the brain issue was resolved. Instead of viewing the resumption of\nchemo as 'regression,' I consider it simply the next phase in treatment of a chronic\ncondition. Thursday I had blood drawn; there were no red flags to delay the start of\nchemo. My bloodwork looked fine. I also met with Dr. Patel on Thursday. I was happy to\nsee him. After a rocky start a few years ago, when I found him rather brusque and\n'unrelatable,' we have developed a warm relationship as we've gotten to know each\nother better. He showed me MRI scans of my brain where I saw, for the first time, the\nlarge tumor that was constricting the left side of my cerebellum - yikes. He said he\nthought I was doing well for my situation, meaning that I'm mobile, driving, have\nrecovered well from the brain operation etc. Dr. Patel (still) refuses to pronounce on life\nspan, refrains from quantifying. He said that it will depend entirely on a) whether the\ncancer has progressed to other organs or has simply progressed in the abdomen and b)\nthe ability of the chemo medication (Taxol) to control the cancer. While this initially\nmade me feel better than Dr. Beavis' prognosis, I was also starting to realize that the\ncancer had to progress from my abdomen to my brain *somehow.* Bloodstream? Lymph\nnodes? Will this happen again? This thought, coupled with Dr. Beavis' early statement\nabout my cancer being particularly aggressive, in fact made me worry more. Dr. Patel\n                    \nalways advises me not to fetishize the CA125 number (\"It's just a number\"). At the same\ntime, I know he is committed to helping me, agreeing heartily when I said: \"If you\ncontinue to treat me, I'll continue to fight\" -- or something like that. When I brought up\ntravel -- Paris is on my mind big time -- he encouraged me to go sooner rather than later,\nfor example, before my next scans for him (in two months) and, of the brain, for\nradiation oncology (three months). This is what I had been thinking too, I would simply\nneed to think through some contingency plans if I start to feel unwell there (I have\nenough Parisian friends to be able to garner a wealth of doctors' recommendations). I\nwas grateful that Dr. Patel had also called me a few weeks ago simply to check in, and\nthat I saw two of my favorite nurses when I was at his office, both of whom were very\nkind, knew about my neurosurgery, and had lots of encouraging words for me.\nThe next morning my neighbor Janis drove me to chemo. I'll be having weekly Taxol\ninfusions (or rather three weeks on, one week off) for one hour, preceded (or\naccompanied by) infusions of saline solution, Decadron (a steroid), anti-nausea medicine\nand Benadryl (which usually knocks me out immediately). I was taking Taxol during the\nclinical trial along with another drug, Fostamatinib (the combination of the two was the\n'trial' aspect). As mentioned, my having had brain surgery now makes me ineligible for\nmost trials. Two of my favorite nurses, Tracey and Brynn, administered my infusion, and\nwere super kind to me. We enjoyed catching one another up on our lives and I showed\nthem some of the pictures of my fabulous birthday cake! Jackie picked me up and drove\nme home w/a detour to Caf\u00e9 Lemont to pick up a cappuccino. I rested for most of the\nafternoon, reading a Gary Shteyngart novel that Michael had recommended to me, _Our\nCountry Friends_ (excellent, love his gift for wit and satire! Another novel that makes me\nlaugh out loud).\nSurprisingly, I didn't sleep well, waking at around 4:30 this morning and sleeping just a\nbit after that. I was tired, but also at times worried about my health, thinking about\nthings I had to do, etc. Hopefully I'll sleep better tonight. I'm very much looking forward\nto my mother visiting for a part of this coming week. I'll have chemo again next Friday,\nplus a visit with my PCP, Dr. Damaske. Will also televisit with Dr. Beavis this Wednesday\nand will be eager to speak with her.\nOverall, though, feeling ok. Sure glad I don't have to deal with the host of stomach woes\nof the first half-year leading to my second, Jan. 2020 surgery (fistula repair): stomach\ndrainage bags, ultra-strong antibiotics, multiple stomach blockages, several failed\nstomach plug procedures, many trips to Hopkins. All is well on that front!\nOne day at a time.\nBe well, everyone.",

    "entry": "I see I haven't provided any updates in a while, partly as I was hosting my mother for the\nbetter part of last week. Since then, I've had one chemo infusion -- Taxol -- which was\nsurprisingly 'untaxing.' My blood counts looked stable aside from a slightly elevated\nbilirubin count. My friend Jackie picked me up from chemo and we returned to my house\nfor a Friday pre-dinner snack along with my friend Martina, bearing adorable plants that\nflowered from seeds from a bag of lemons I had in the fridge. The get-together was also\nthe pretext for Jackie and Martina to meet my mother (in Martina's case, to meet her for\na second time as they had met at an MLA convention a long time ago). Earlier in the\nweek, my friend Helen also came over to visit with me and my mom; we had all enjoyed\na lovely lunch outdoors at the Ale House last summer, along with my friends Kathryn\n(w/whom I enjoyed another *indoors* Ale House lunch this last week) and John. In any\nevent, the chemo did not tire me out excessively, and I was able to take a long drive\nSaturday after I had put my mother on the Megabus back to the city.\nI also had a post-op visit with my PCP, Dr. Damaske, and a video visit with Dr. Beavis and\nnurse Justin Mahonsky, who had worked with me when I was participating in the clinical\ntrial. Our hour-long meeting was very useful, as always, and I suppose a bit sobering.\nBoth told me I looked \"amazing\" (I'll cling to every shred of my vanity for as long as I\ncan!). After my two scans (brain and pelvis/abdomen/chest) in about two months, Dr.\nBeavis would like to add Avastin to my chemo cocktail, as it has been shown to make\nTaxol work better. As you may recall, a potential side effect of Avastin is bowel\nperforation, which I *may* be even more susceptible to as in March 2020 (just as COVID\nhit) I had a long operation to repair a fistula between my bowel and abdomen. However,\nas the number of viable treatment options 'dwindles' (my word, which Dr. Beavis found\napt), the risk/reward calculus must be reassessed with that in mind. Since I asked Dr.\nBeavis, in this same conversation, how my 'demise' would likely 'go down,' she told me\nthat it would entail running out of viable treatment options. At that point, a likely (but not\ndefinite) way death would occur would be loss of appetite (how ironic!) as tumors begin\nto colonize the bowel, causing obstruction. Her recent suggestion of a potential lifespan\nof \"six months to two years\" (while of course with the added caveat that these are\naverages, there are outliers, each case can be different etc.) made me tell her and Justin\nthat I was \"mad\" about this (why wouldn't I be? It sucks!). But then I felt guilty towards\nDr. Beavis, whom I feared might think I was mad at her, so I wrote her a note to clarify.\nShe understood completely - she must get this all the time from patients.\nIndeed, fear and anger are fairly new components of my emotional vocabulary right now,\ndespite my efforts to allay them and my firm intent to maintain a posture of gratitude\nand happiness (I told my therapist today that I felt \"it would be a crime\" for me not to\nremain positive, although she thought the word 'crime' was a bit strong...). On my\nbrother's recommendation, I just bought Fear: Essential Wisdom for Getting through the\nStorm by Thich Nhat Hanh, and look forward to reading it now that I'm between two\n                    \nShteyngarts. I also want to read Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life\nInterrupted by Suleika Jaouad, a bestselling NYTimes author who wrote \"The Isolation\nJournals\" for the Times when she was a 22-year-old leukemia survivor (her cancer has\njust recurred at age 33). I'm interested in what she has to write about creativity and the\nspecial (sacred?) nature of these 'life interruptions.' In the meantime, rereading my blog\n(actually editing it into user-friendly shape), time with friends and family, buds on trees,\ncooking and more are proving therapeutic and keeping me 'positive' (I really don't know\nwhat the appropriate word is here...).\nI have a big, complicated decision to make about whether or not I'll go to Paris during an\noff week for chemo. I won't write too much about it here because it's a fraught decision\nthat I'm still contemplating and that seems to have taken on existential dimensions for\nme (while I still have a niggling feeling of 'first-world problems' with so much crisis\noccurring in the world). I change my mind every day. My doctors are presenting this to\nme as a 'bucket list' item, for which I have a very small window of opportunity. I'm very\ntempted to flip this script and hold out for a wider window, simply out of cockiness. After\nall, both Dr. Patel and Dr. Damaske refuse to pronounce on lifespan, stressing that each\ncase is individualized and really depends on how effective the medication is. Reward v.\nrisk: spending time with beloved friends, returning to meaningful places (a bench in the\ngardens of the Palais-Royal; the march\u00e9 d'Aligre; my old apartments beginning in Passy),\ntouching base with work contacts, eating favorite foods in favorite places. For now, I'd\nlike to eschew the idea of a 'victory lap' or, rather, 'valedictory,' much as I'd like to\nsidestep the 'bucket list' idea. Risks: coming COVID surge in Europe (??), falling ill\nw/cancer or COVID in Paris (potentially disastrous on many levels), neurosurgeon's\nsuggestion that the jet flight could make me 'slightly uncomfortable' but would not cause\ndamage to the work he did (!), uncertainty about whether I could have the experience I\nwanted rather than something else, perhaps tinged with a bit of worry; potential\nnecessity of making the trip myself (which normally would not be a problem but that\nleaves me a bit anxious right now); unease of certain family members. I need to gather\nsome additional information (have queried Dr. Bettegowda about just how uncomfortable\nmy head might be from the flight; need to follow up with my friends who still *might*\nwant to make the trip, as we had planned from the start). I believe there's no right or\nwrong decision here; whatever I decide, I will create the optimal conditions around it.\nBtw, Drs. Patel and Damaske are strongly in favor of my Paris idea; Dr. Beavis sounded\nmore cautious but would support the idea as well. She doesn't want me to wind up in the\nhospital in Paris.\nMy mother and I had a lovely time taking drives to neighboring towns, lunching,\nshopping, feeding the ducks in Talleyrand Park, talking, watching _West Side Story_ (an\nAmerican masterpiece; mediocre movie) etc. It was nice to have her company. I'll attach\na few pics.\n                    \nI'm very much looking forward to lunch with the \"III Cs\" this week and to spending time\nwith other survivors, at different points in our treatment, survivorship etc. I'm less\nlooking forward to having an X-ray (likely on Thursday) of my left hip, which has felt a bit\nsore recently (but which I'm hoping 'just' has a touch of arthritis). When I mentioned it to\nDrs. Beavis and Damaske, I had in mind that my dear grade school friend Debbie's\ncancer had spread at one point into her hip, nearly incapacitating her (not my case in the\nleast). Much as it's a bit scary, I felt I needed to 'come clean' about this and not delay\nfurther. Fingers crossed. I also had my fourth COVID shot today, a bit of extra protection\nfor us immunocompromised folk. Hoping not to experience flu-like effects from it. So far\nso good.\nSince I'll be tethered to my chemo pole once a week (three weeks on, one week off),\nplease come visit me this spring or summer, provided I feel ok. Am I being pathetic and\nneedy here or simply stating my needs and desires explicitly? Or invite me to come visit\nyou or meet you halfway, if it's not too far. Local friends: I will continue to reach out too,\nof course. We have: breweries, farmers markets, farm to table restaurants, a network of\ncreeks, hiking trails, state parks, Creamery ice cream, a local music scene, a beautiful\narboretum, roadside fruit and vegetable stands, Amish farms and hamlets, antiques\nstores and, chez moi, a private bedroom and bathroom upstairs (\"Ben's lair\" when he's\nhere), comfy condo, summer kitchen. My grad school besties are coming out in late April,\nafter I return from the city (where I'll get to cheer Ben on in the first Brooklyn half-\nmarathon). But consider a country getaway!\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Since last week my abdomen has begun to make itself known, with significant discomfort\nin my stomach and other points in my abdominal area. New cancer? Scar tissue?\nBlockage? Dr. Patel ordered a CT scan for tomorrow afternoon, never pleasant (long\nprocedure, four hour fast, drink that tastes like greasy melted chalk) but necessary to\nfind out what's going on. Luckily, there was a cancellation tomorrow afternoon at Gray's\nWoods; otherwise I would have needed to wait until mid-April for the scan. Never a dull\nmoment. Of course, this makes me very anxious. I received the result of the hip x-ray\nbut as a non-medical professional am having trouble parsing it. The bottom line seems to\nbe that an MRI or CT-scan is needed for further clarification. And some of the discomfort\nthere may simply be due to cartilage loss and not necessarily new cancer, as I\nsuspected.\nMy sleep last night was fairly atrocious. I awoke every hour or two with horrible leg\ncramps, most likely due to dehydration because of diarrhea (tmi?). A combination of leg\nmassages, heating pads, numerous glasses of water etc. finally relieved me of the\ncramps but I feel slightly zombie-like today. Oh well. The night before I slept well. I\nrested a bit and got myself a cappuccino and felt better.\nI am trying to get on top of my anxiety. Sometimes it's hard. I'm reading _Fear: Essential\nWisdom for Getting through the Storm,_ by Thich Nhat Hanh but it's not helping! Phrases\nlike \"there is no death, only continuation\" really don't resonate with me. I do believe that\neach individual lives on after death, indirectly, in the fruits of the actions they performed\non earth, in their accomplishments, in their progeny etc. but this is in no way comparable\nto having the physical person around. It is a memory-based connection, at least that's\nhow I'm conceiving of it now. Mindful breathing, mindfulness, grounding oneself in the\npresent moment etc., which this Buddhist Zen master recommends, are all useful\npractices. But I'm simply not finding his book that useful, so maybe I'll return to B.J.\nMiller's Ted Talk about \"what really matters at the end of life.\" Maybe I'm just not cut out\nto be a Buddhist or even a JewBu. I could use  more Zen in my life, but my at times\nparalyzing anxiety needs to make way for it.\nTherefore, no decision about a Paris trip yet until I get a handle on what may or may not\nbe going on with me physically.\nNo other major developments to report from last week. My Taxol infusion, once again,\ndid not knock me out last Friday - something to be thankful for at least. I have a week off\nfrom chemo this week as my white blood cells replenish. Was at the dentist for cleaning\nand for Steve to look at some bonding work that needs repair. Otherwise, always a high\npoint was lunch with the \"III Cs,\" four other survivors whose company feels safe and\nuplifting. Deb, a twelve(?)-year survivor who has been in treatment nearly continuously\nand has outlived all predictions, is an inspiration. Felt equally gratified attending the\n                    \nAlumni Association awards dinner at the Penn Stater Saturday night with Morgane, a\ngraduate student whose dissertation I direct, and her husband, Aaron. Morgane is one of\nthirteen recipients university- wide of the Alumni Association Dissertation Award, which\nrecognizes the quality of her research. She's an exceptional student and lovely person\nand I'm happy to have any small role to play in her success. Sunday morning Maria and I\ndrove out to Elk Creek Caf\u00e9, a cool farm to table restaurant/brewery out in Amish country\nand, with the church-going buggies rolling by, we enjoyed brunch with Mar and Jessica,\ntwo other friends we hadn't seen in a while (Mar's painting are on exhibit at the caf\u00e9).\nOur former long-time dean (27 years?), Susan Welch, died last night of liver cancer.\nWhen I was a rank and file faculty member and department head, Susan was always 'the\ndean,' a slightly formidable figure. She worked indefatigably to raise the profile of the\nCollege of the Liberal Arts at Penn State, and succeeded. She was a prominent political\nscientist who recently began working on the Holocaust. Her legacy is remarkable.\nSunday a building will be dedicated in her honor (sadly, she will not have made it to the\ninauguration ceremony). Through our shared cancer journeys, though, we became closer\nthe past few years -- lunches out, email, soup deliveries, sharing details of our\ntreatment. We bonded. I saw her a few weeks ago when I brought her some butternut\nsquash soup. She looked quite frail but was headed to the office to work! And there goes\nthat 'whoosh' of cancer close by, again. I hope she had a peaceful death, the death she\nwanted.\nAlso had a long overdue zoom catch-up with my dear first cousin, Julie Eagle-Cardo, the\none I was thrown into the crib with when we were both a few weeks old. We've been\nthick as thieves our entire lives, from commuting between the city and Fairfield County,\nCT, when we were teens to enjoy adventuresome weekends, to travelling together in\nEurope, to experiencing milestones at the same time, to having sons, to producing\nreams of correspondence and emails over the years. I never had a biological sister but\nJulie comes close. May you be so lucky as to have such a close relative/'forever friend'\ntoo.\nFinally, several people have inquired about the Stride and Thrive event for which I\norganized a team the past two years to help raise funds for KEGOS (Hopkins' Kelly\nGynecologic Oncology Service). Our great team, both in State College and elsewhere (in\nthe States and abroad), ran/walked on clear June days while sporting our #willapower\nshirts. I just got off the phone with one of this year's organizers, who seemed to want\nfeedback from me as my fundraising efforts have been so successful the past two years.\nLong story short: they are not opting for the run/walk format as they have the past two\nyears (which itself had replaced a 'cast of thousands' event in Baltimore, which Covid put\nan end to). Instead, they will be hosting a garden party in Maryland on June 26th. A\nmonth before that, though, they will organize a run/walk, similar to the Stride and Thrive\nof years past. To be honest, they seem a bit disorganized and behind schedule. But there\n*will* be an opportunity for fundraising once they work out some blips in their website.\n                    \nAll this to say that I hope to raise funds for KEGOS once again this year, and will share\ndetails, but must wait for Hopkins to get its act together first!",
    "comments": "Fingers crossed, Willa, for these upcoming tests. The pause was not long enough!\nLooking forward to tomorrow.\nThree cheers for Morgane (she IS wonderful), and her dissertation director (also\nwonderful, differently)!\nAnd so sorry to hear about Susan.

XO\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 28, 2022  \nMay your current anxiety dissipate with wonderfully negative tests! You deserve some\nrespite-- including, maybe, that long-anticipated trip to Paris!!

Glad you have so many loving friends and memories to support you in such\ndark days; you always seem to find happy moments and get togethers with people who\nmean so much to you and vice versa. I want you to know I'm compiling a list of special\nplaces in Centre County from your blog: beautiful drives, restaurants of all sorts, fun\nvisiting spots and more. I label it \"places I wouldn't have known of but for Willa\".\nThank you.\nSome people find comfort from Jon Kabat-Zen's \"Full Catastrophe Living\" (available free\nonline).\nI'm thinking of you tonight hoping for a peaceful sleep and also, of course, for a\nreassuring outcome to the CT scan tomorrow. Hope you have something that tickles your\npalate after that ghastly infusion, and most of all, for good news afterwards.\nYou can be sure you are in many people's hearts especially when faced with such\nhurdles. Among your immense team, count me, sending as much good will (and\nadmiration) as I can* . How fortunate you are so very strong; if only you weren't called\nupon to tap every molecule of that special fortitude though.\n*And yes, you look impossibly gorgeous in your recently posted photos.\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, March 28, 2022  \n  \nApril 2, 2022 - Verdigris",

    "entry": "As for the title word of this blog post, I just like it. It also contains the word 'gris,' which is\nhow I was feeling a few days this week. And I love that blue-green patina formed by\noxidation. Confused yet?\nI spent so much time at Gray's Woods this past week that it was really starting to\ndepress me -- until I remembered that the place is full of medical professionals whose job\nit is to *help* patients and hopefully make them feel better. I also feel innately\ncompassionate towards people with serious health challenges. My house cleaner, Missy,\ntold me yesterday that she has a brain tumor (benign yet growing) and other health\nissues, and that her fianc\u00e9 has cancer. Her parents were both alcoholics. She is rural and\npoor -- like many who live just beyond State College -- and works hard to make it. I wish\nher a happy day today, fishing with her granddaughter.\nI had separate appointments at Gray's Woods for the first shingles vaccine (which I\nwanted to make sure to get), a urine analysis (yep, I have *another* UTI, which hopefully\nthe antibiotics will take care of; must keep ultra-hydrated at all times), and a CT-scan (oh\nyes, I think I was there a fourth time, to pick up a disk with CT-scan imaging on it,\nbecause they were unable to burn a disk while I was there. This is really pretty lame,\nconsidering that, over the past few years, Geisinger has *never been able* to forward\nimaging directly to Hopkins; I always have to pick up a disk and then upload the imaging\nmyself).\nAnyhoo...\nThe CT-scan did not reveal a stomach blockage! I am so relieved. I went on a liquid diet\nfor a few days and that seemed to help. It's hard for me to parse the results of the\nradiologist's report but Dr. Patel called me briefly to discuss (I'm not convinced he looked\nat the actual imaging, which I want him to, and which I'll discuss with him this Friday\nwhen I see him). Besides the results pertaining to the bowel, the scan revealed some\ndecrease in size in certain cancerous masses and lymph nodes and some increase in\nother lymph nodes (which is what chemo is for...). I don't know, though, whether the net\nresult is an increase or a decrease in cancerous mass and exactly where these nodes are\nsituated (they had names I did not recognize; I suppose I could look them up but I'd\nprefer to let Dr. Patel or Dr. Beavis, who has been away and will return this week,\nexplain). Dr. Patel said that the most enlarged lymph node was in my abdomen but that\nit \"shouldn't bother me a lot.\" I also still don't understand why I have marked discomfort\nat the bottom tip of my right rib cage (the CT-scan revealed nothing of concern in my\nliver). More points to bring up with the doctors this week.\nSo...onward we go, with what sometimes seems like a ticking time bomb inside me. Not\neasy.\n                    \nAll the medical 'stuff' was at the root of a dark hole I was plunged into, and couldn't get\nout of, for about two-three days this past week. I was afraid that being mired in my\nhealth issues was going to wipe out the memory of how much *fun* I certainly used to\nbe, and like to think I still am! I was feeling super-stuck and therefore doing nothing,\nfeeling paralyzed, when I still get on my case for every moment 'wasted.' 'My incredible\nshrinking' world depressed me. And so did not feeling well, of course.\nWhat helped lift me out of my gloom was the support of friends! May sound corny to say,\nbut true. \"Be of good cheer,\" writes Whitman in _Song of Myself._ \"We will not desert\nyou.\" A few texts reminded me that I am not alone.While opening gifts that arrived\nsimultaneously from two wonderful friends and reading the note from one, I *literally*\nfelt my spirits lift and I could hear myself saying \"Awwww!\" and smiling (I do want to\nclarify here - not that it's necessary -- that I am not \"holding out\" for gifts, nor do I\nconsider them *at all* a more tangible display of friendship. I am certainly not that kind\nof materialist, either! Gifts are lovely [thank you for the tea, Martina!] But a kind word,\nvisit, call -- or simply taking the time to read what I've posted -- is really a mood-lifter).\nIn any event, my dear old friend and colleague, Jim, sent me _The Book of Joy,_\nconversations between the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu. I can't wait to read this book,\nas Thich, no matter how noble a man he was (and I'm sure he was), is simply not doing it\nfor me. And my college friend Wilson, w/whom I've reconnected, sent me blueberry\npreserves and pear compote that he canned himself from fruit on his farm. He sent me\nthe kindest note, too. Wilson, thank you so much for lifting my spirits and I will write you\nsoon! Thinking of the right words to you in response...\nI'm feeling generally ok. It looked like the sun was out this morning so I got myself out of\nbed, got a cappuccino at Caf\u00e9 Lemont and then drove to Tati's cakeshop, the one that\nproduced my stupendous birthday cake, for some muffins. Will take another drive this\nafternoon to view early spring in the country; it will be calming. Dinner tomorrow night\nwith my friend Maria, and thank you, Monique, for coming to dinner at my place after my\ntiring CT-scan experience.\nI did enjoy a lovely dinner at the Tavern with Dallas, a former undergraduate student\nwho I taught *thirty* years ago! We lost touch for a while but have since reconnected as\nfriends. We talked about Henri Vever (whose 1898 diary he read, and I signed with a\ndedication to Dallas) and many other things French, essential oils, life, work and much\nelse. Dallas is returning to French after varied and interesting first (and second) careers,\nsubstituting and perhaps eventually teaching in a private school in his home of Reading,\nPA. He was kind enough to share that he remembered I always dressed up for class (at\nleast in the early days!), in my cute Parisian skirts and heels and jewelry, and that it was\nalways fun to see what I'd turn up to class wearing. Love this memory! Dallas (who must\nlove good smelly stuff like me), also gifted me a lovely lilac candle from Etsy with a\n                    \nheady odor; that smell will always remind me of the end of the semester, when the lilacs,\nas if on cue, bloom on the path besides \"Deans' Walk,\" a row of office in Sparks Building).\nThere is a line from the prayerbook we use for shabbat services that came to mind: \"We\nare loved by everlasting love. We are [?] by arms we cannot see.\"\nBen - who turns 27 on Monday! - will be coming 'home' in about two weeks, around\nPassover. Then, if all goes well, I'll head to NY later this month to watch him run in the\nfirst Brooklyn Marathon. He graduates next month from NYU with an M.S. in Data Science\nand is narrowing in on some worthy job possibilities. He and a friend are off to a\nbutchering class in Brooklyn today, a present from their girlfriends - I asked for pictures\nof these two bros sipping a beer after butchering an animal -- so Brooklyn.\nI wanted to remember a strange dream I had: Michael (my ex-husband) said he was\nabout to join a (the?) squash team. People in his household were also about to embark\non a sale of Girl Scout cookies. I inquired about purchasing thin mints, my favorites. In\nthe next scene,  I was dancing with Jason Momoa (not unpleasant!); he was behind me\nand we were kind of loping/dancing along and having a conversation at the same time.\nHe expressed a wish to be invited to my house (but I think it was my mother's house?)\nfor a stay. I alluded to the previous guest, who had had drug issues (somehow conflated\nin my dream with my ex-boyfriend Gregory). End of dream. Wonder if the final part might\necho the death of Taylor Hawkins, a musician I long found charismatic and talented; I\nhad listened to many interviews with Taylor and Dave Grohl, although I really didn't\nknow the Foo Fighters' music very well. What a pity.",
    "comments": "Dearest Willa, I can only imagine the diving into the depths of all the medical details, but\nyes, at times, unfortunately, (and exasperating) that one often has to monitor the\ncommunication between teams oneself while also in treatment! You are doing amazing\njob! Sounds like you returned to some bluer skies with friends (and muffins!). I hear you\nre: Thich in your comment before. The mindful meditating can be a helpful tool, but the\nBuddhism/religious element isn\u2019t my thing either. Dalai Lama/Desmond Tutu sounds\npromising! Might have to take a look myself!

The writing is helpful... Hope you are well. xox\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, April 2, 2022  \nAfter joyfully reading about the negative results of your CT-scan, I turned to a following\nparagraph eulogizing the support of friends, presumably on both bright and somber\ndays. You offer us numerous perfect examples, such as hoping Missy have a good day,\nand Susan Welch have the peaceful death she wanted. Not to mention the patients being\nhelped at Gray's Woods! XOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, April 2, 2022  \nWilla, the good news jumped out at me from this update\u2014nothing worrisome in the liver\nand no stomach blockage!! That sounds like a win overall. Your few down days are\nunderstandable and I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re back in your happy routines of country drives\nand dinners with friends. I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about in terms of how\npeople see you. Even while battling cancer, you\u2019re more of a fun-loving and energetic\nextrovert and lover of life\u2019s pleasures than many who aren\u2019t managing such a challenge.\nMy grandmother used to say, well into her 90s, \u201cPeople see me as old but I just feel like\nmyself, the self I\u2019ve always been.\u201d To know one\u2019s self and live vibrantly and authentically\nyour whole life is a blessing indeed. I\u2019ll be thinking about books that might move you and\nfeel strengthening to the spirit. Sophie and I hope to get to State College early this\nsummer and it would be wonderful to see you. xoxo M.\n  \u2014Melissa Beattie Moss, April 2, 2022  \nYou are always fun :-) and full of life. Some dark days is human and I think needed to be\nable to come out and be part of it all again.

    "entry": "Dear friends,\nFor the third year in a row, I am privileged to be raising funds for KEGOS (the Kelly\nGynecologic Oncology Center) at Johns Hopkins, and its programs. I would be honored if\nyou would consider making a donation in any amount, to help women like myself (and\nincluding myself!) thrive while confronted with often insidious diseases. The website for\ndonations is: ttps://runsignup.com/Race/127044/Donate/Qq4CULKMK4y6KGMx\nThe website has changed a bit since last year. If you are able to make a donation to my\nteam (#willapower) as opposed to a donation to my individual fundraising account (there\nmay be a button on the page for this purpose), please do. All donations go directly to\nJohns Hopkins.\nIf you have any questions/problems, please ask!\nThe format for the culminating event has changed a bit. This year a garden party for\nsurvivors is planned at an estate in Maryland, on June 26th. I *believe* that one month\nbefore that, on May 26th, there will be a 'fitness challenge' similar to the 1k walk/5 mile\nrun some of us have participated in the past few years in locations as far flung as State\nCollege, New York, Philly, Baltimore, Michigan, California, Massachusetts, and Japan! I\nwill let you know as plans for this event develop and, as/if they do, look forward to\n(re)assembling team #willapower for the occasion!\nThank you.",

    "entry": "First, I wanted to thank the following friends and family members for donating\ngenerously to the Stride and Thrive/Reunite and Reignite Fundraiser for KEGOS: Phil,\nClare, Susan Wolfert (whom I don't believe I know), Kathryn, Denise, Helen, June (my\ncousin), Julie (my cousin), Sharon (aka mom), Jane G. We are nearing 20% of our\nfundraising goal. The link to the donations page is in the entry just before this one.\nThank you in advance for helping women like myself combat ovarian, uterine and other\n'below the belt' cancers.\nI've appreciated the blessing of a relatively 'normal' (all things considered etc.) week,\nmeaning no unexpected medical visits, subsiding abdominal pain, a suspected UTI that\nturned out not to be one, decent energy level etc. This meant that I was able to fully\nenjoy great convo and brunch with Martina at the Naked Egg Cafe (a cute local place);\ndrinks with Katerina at Gigi's (a mocktail for me), and dinner at the Ale House (packed to\nthe gills; this town always confounds me that way) with Lisa S. Taxol continues to treat\nme fairly kindly; I did crash for almost two hours after returning from my infusion around\nnoon yesterday (but I attribute that in part to the early start time of my appointment\nwith Dr. Patel), A day after chemo, though, I feel relatively chipper, have a pot of chicken\nsoup simmering and may head out in search of horseradish (the Amish make a\n                    \nparticularly pungent variety).\nPer my appointment with Dr. Patel, things *seem* status quo; when I asked him whether\nthere had been a net increase or decrease in the amount of cancer in my body, he said it\nwas hard to tell. Because cancer cells mutate so efficiently, with the goal of 'outsmarting'\nthe chemo drugs, the Taxol may prove more effective against certain types of cancer\ncells than against others. Also, he explained that different groups of cells have different\nblood supplies -- at least that's what I understood. So treating these stealthy cells is\ncomplicated indeed. He attributed the discomfort at the bottom tip of my right ribs to an\nirritation of some sort, but I'm hoping that the Hopkins' radiologists will also offer their\nanalysis of the imaging. For now, then (and 'now' may mean a shorter or longer window,\nas I've become used to planning for small increments of time), my situation seems\nrelatively stable (and I feel obliged to add that 'relatively' there!).\nI'm looking forward to digging into _Between Two Kingdoms_ by Suleika Jouad (Jon\nBatiste's wife), a compilation of the pieces she wrote for the _NYTimes_ as \"Life,\nInterrupted\" when she was a twenty-two year old diagnosed with leukemia and then\nrecovering from it (sadly and unusually, her leukemia has recently recurred ten years\nlater). The book has been well reviewed and I'm interested to learn more about her\nperspective and absorb any wisdom I can from it). Will start _The Book of Joy_ after that,\nor maybe at the same time.\nI've been wondering what people mean when they say they are 'inspired' by me. It\nseems to me that if you want to live, you make that your goal and pursue it tenaciously.\nUndergoing treatment for cancer is a *project.* Not everyone undertakes it tenaciously,\nbut wouldn't most people? If at some point I decide to refuse further treatment, will I still\n'inspire' you? What about me inspires you? Do my actions inspire you to act or live\ndifferently, to adjust your perspective or your values? I've actually received some pretty\ninteresting and often surprising answers to this question (my cousin Julie offered one,\nhaving to do with my writing I believe, but I can't remember the particulars). I do\nunderstand that for the seven or so 'thrivers' (a word I sometimes prefer to 'survivors')\nreading my blog, including a few dealing with serious chronic illness and several in\ntreatment for cancer now or in the past, it is possible to empathize and draw strength\nfrom the words of another person confronting a more or less analogous situation. But I'm\nnever sure what it might mean for others. Is it something people say -- reflecting a\ntendency to heroize suffering -- or something that truly helps them on their journey?\nI'm also confused by people who demur about discussing their problems with you\nbecause they feel you 'have it much worse.' I don't understand what kinds of feelings\ngenerate a statement like that. Some sort of guilt, I guess, but why? Everyone's frame of\nreference is different. If it's a problem for you, it's a problem. There are people worse off\nthan me; if they were my friends, I wouldn't let that deter me from sharing my troubles\nwith them. If you sincerely feel guilty about talking about your problems because you're\n                    \nafraid I might find them trivial, I will let you know that. I will also let you know if I need to\ntalk about what's going on with me in terms of my health issues (I will likely calibrate the\namount/type of information I share depending on my interlocutor). But I don't need to\ntalk about them all the time; it becomes boring after a while and I'm still more than\ncapable of friendships based on exchange (I thrive on them, actually). As most of you\nknow, I also abhor any kind of statement even slightly tinged with pity, which doesn't\nmean ignoring that I have a serious illness that is simply a *fact* of my life right now.\nAnyhoo...\nI am so excited about Ben coming 'home' on W for a visit over the holiday. I hope we'll\nhave a meaningful seder and a good meal (there must be matzah ball soup! and brisket!\nand lotsa matzah! and tzimmes!). Whatever 'narrow place of bondage' (mizraim) --as\nEgypt was for the Israelites -- you find yourself in, whether physical, emotional, spiritual,\npsychological -- I wish you a way out of it. I have found several prayers for Ukraine that I\nwill incorporate. While I hope at times to be released from the 'bondage' of serious\nillness, I know for sure that opportunities for joy in life abound and are present for me.",

I am forever grateful for our forever friendship! It\u2019s been a unique source of joy in\nmy life since my earliest memory! \ufffd\ufffd\nNext, I was intrigued to learn you plan to read Between Two Kingdoms by Suleika Jouad,\nwhich I was about to recommend to you! Until recently, I was only vaguely familiar with\n(but hadn't read) her enormously well-received NY Times column. Then just last Sunday,\nafter Jon Batiste won no less than 5 Grammy\u2019s, I ended up learning tons about her. I\u2019ve\nbeen a huge fan of Jon\u2019s since he began performing every weeknight on one of my\nfavorite shows -- Stephen Colbert. Suffice to say, I was beyond moved to learn about his\nextraordinary love story with Suleika. (They\u2019d been a couple for 10 years+ but shared a\n\u201csecret wedding\u201d right as she learned her cancer had returned and as he was preparing\nfor the Grammy\u2019s.) \nWilla, sweetie, you also mentioned something I said related to feeling inspired by your\nwriting. Well, I also don\u2019t recall exactly what I said, LOL\ufffd\ufffd, but I do know that I endlessly\nadmire and feel inspired by the marvelous way you\u2019ve \u201ctaken action\u201d throughout your\nillness, doggedly pouring your heart and soul into this blog, not only enabling your\nreaders to \u201cbe there\u201d with you (despite geographical distance, Covid, and other damn\nobstacles) but gifting everyone with your provocative observations, insights, humor,\nsensory descriptions, poetic musings, dream interpretations  -- and, finally, but perhaps\nmost significantly, your continuous expressions of serene acceptance, genuine gratitude,\nand pure joy wherever you can find it.\nWho can\u2019t help but feel inspired? \nThank you again, dearest cousin.

You tell us\nabout family and friends, activities, successes, good books; but also, about the blessing\nof a normal week, the search for horseradish, your feeling of \"So much love. I'm a lucky\ngirl.

There is absolutely no way you will \u201cfail\u201d on\nthis path of illness and treatment.

    "entry": "Thank you so much, Scott, for your generous donation to team #willapower! Scott's\ndonation brings us to 39% of our fundraising goal. I'd be very grateful for your\ncontribution, so would other women battling below the belt cancers, and so would the\nstaff of KEGOS, the Kelly Gynecological Oncology Service at Johns Hopkins, an\nextraordinary institution. Please let me know if you need direction to the donation page.\nIt's a busy time -- which I hope is a good thing as opposed to a depleting one -- but\nwanted to share the news that I *have* decided to go to Paris for a week, May 4-12. One\ndeciding factor was the wonderful offer by a very dear high school friend, Jill Morey\nGaines, to accompany me on the trip! Jill has proved an exceptional, highly supportive\nfriend throughout my illness, driving out here from Princeton, NJ (where one of her three\ndaughters lives) a year or two ago to lift my spirits, help me out around the house and\ntown, and drive me to Hopkins if necessary (it turned out not to be, at the last minute).\nBut then again, Jill is the friend who, after my parents got divorced many years ago\n(when we were in high school), invited me to spend the weekend in Atlantic City in an\napartment owned by the family of another friend, Debbie (of blessed memory). They\nwere the only two friends who reached out to me in such a direct, kind way, and that\nseaside weekend with my two friends was a balm for me, as I recall. Jill went to a French\nschool before joining us at Nightingale for high school, speaks French, has been to Paris,\nand understands the adjustments I may need to make on this trip (ie sadly, likely no\nmore 15 km strolls around Paris and perhaps a mid-afternoon nap on some days when\nmy stamina is low). She said she'd be content to sit in a caf\u00e9 together for several hours\nand people watch (as would I) and knows that there are a few friends I may need to\n                    \nspend a bit of time with solo. I can't think of a better travel companion, in fact. She's a\nlot of fun! And we're totally on the same page when it comes to shopping, eating out,\nsome light museum going etc. Merci, Jill :). Jill will fly from her home near LA at the\nbeginning of May, spend a night or more at her apartment in NYC, then meet me at\nNewark for our flight (let's just say we're both pampering ourselves throughout the trip).\nWe'll return on the same flight on the 12th, then I'll catch a connecting flight from\nNewark to State College, just in time for chemo the next day...\nA particularly luminous spring day in State College also, somehow, made me yearn for\nthe luminosity and visual gorgeousness of Paris in the spring. One *can* feel a deep\nemotional connection to a place, and I want to be there, sitting on a bench in the Palais-\nRoyal, strolling the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, spending a lazy afternoon in the Tuileries\nor Jardin du Luxembourg chatting with a friend, eating a baguette sandwich in the place\ndes Vosges, people watching over a caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me on the _terrasse_  of a caf\u00e9.\nJill and I are staying at H\u00f4tel Le Mareuil in the 11e, a nice-looking boutique hotel Jill's\ntravel agent identified for us. I had wanted to stay right in the Marais, but the hotel I like\nthere (Grand Malher) is fully booked. We won't be far, though, from the 'haut Marais,'\nR\u00e9publique, the trendy Oberkampf neighborhood, even the Canal Saint-Martin, and the\nmarch\u00e9 Richard-Lenoir, so we're well-situated. \nI've started making some plans with friends (Jill and I will have a reunion with one of our\n32 high school classmates, ie 'sisters,' Christina, and her delightful husband, Vincent). If I\nhaven't contacted you yet, Paris friends, I will do so within the next day or two! \nRestaurant recs welcome, btw. I do have my favorites, of course, but it will have been\n*three* years since my last visit, and the dining scene can morph rapidly.\nI understand that my plans could still be upended. There is so much uncertainty\nsurrounding my illness. Between now and May 4th, I could still experience a stomach\nblockage, headaches, or other worrisome cancer-related symptoms. And then there's\nCOVID. I've asked a few friends to supply doctors' names/numbers there in case of\nemergency. I will take all the precautions. Hopefully, I'll have the will(a)power to make\nsome necessary modifications to diet, alcohol intake etc. while in Paris -- many\ntemptations there, of course, as I search for the ultimate _tarte au citron_ (and have a\ngood idea of where to find it), and I again need to chart a middle ground between\nindulgence and the real care with which I must treat my body. Oy!\nI am feeling generally ok these days -- something like a modified 'honeymoon period' as\nI've experienced with OC before -- chemo went smoothly yesterday -- and just need to\nstay well during a busy upcoming stretch -- always need to find that balance between\ntaking advantage of the well-feeling periods and not overdoing it. Ben is here for a few\ndays and we enjoyed a lovely seder last night with all sorts of yummy food that I cooked\n                    \nover a two-week period (I'll perhaps write another entry about that). Thursday or Friday,\nafter chemo, we will most likely drive into the city, where I'll spend about a week. On the\nagenda is hanging out with my mother (who's recovering from a fall in the street,\nfortunately *not* resulting in any broken bones but still a badly sprained knee and ankle\nand nasty bruises); lunch with two more wonderful high school friends, one of whom I\nhaven't seen in a few years outside Zoom; part of a day with Mitchel, my very dear\ncollege friend of 45 years, who will be visiting the States from Nice; if all goes well (ie\nsomewhat iffy Achilles heel permitting), the first Brooklyn half-marathon, in which Ben\nwill be running; a little shopping for Paris. Then back to State College for the arrival of\nmy three grad school pals (\"les filles\"), Isa, Vinni and Shanny, for one night chez moi and\na second at Bedford Springs resort and spa in Bedford, PA (about a 1.5 hour drive from\nhere). Following our nascent tradition that began at Kripalu yoga center a few years ago,\nwe'll seek answers to our pressing questions from Shanny's crystal pendulum, act much\nyounger and sillier than our age, collapse into gales of giggles, take goofy selfies of\nourselves, have slumber parties, reminisce, and share some serious talk too. A few days\nafter the pals leave I head to Paris. Kooky planning? Too much? So far the efforts are\nproving uplifting and not debilitating as it's all about fun, vibrancy and life as I like to live\nit, taking it by the horns and riding it for all it's worth. And then there are those seeds\nplanted in the back of my mind by my medical team (whose members are generally\nenthusiastic about my making this trip) about these weeks representing some sort of\n'window of opportunity' that may or may not present itself again. Hence a\ncertain...franticness? Of course, I hope this episode won't end with a curtain falling on\nthe action, but I'm apprehensive about a potential upcoming change in chemo regimen\nand some telltale scans, likely in June. Ah well, \"I'll think about it tomorrow.\"",

    "entry": "Many, many thanks to the most recent donors - Scott S., Josh, and Nancy - to the Kelly\nGynecological Oncology Service's annual Stride and Thrive event (\"Reunite and\nReignite\") to help women combatting gyn. cancers. We've reached 40.7% of our\nfundraising goal. To donate, please find the relevant link listed in the posting a few\nentries before this one; please let me know if you'd like help locating it.\nAlso: would any State College (or other?) peeps be available to drive me to Newark\nairport on W 4 May to catch my 6:30 p.m. flight to Paris? On the return, I will fly from\nNewark directly back to State College, but would really prefer to drive directly to Newark\non the 4th rather than getting there via NYC. The direct flight to Newark from SC will not\nwork out for me on the 4th. I realize this is a big ask but thought I'd try.\nI haven't written in a while. There's been much activity recently. I'm trying to take\nadvantage of the proverbial \"window of opportunity\" my doctors have identified for me\nto travel, see friends and family etc. This makes for a very busy time. Cancer time is so\nstrange. Because there is so much uncertainty surrounding my health, I am often\ncompelled to measure time in very short increments. Let me get through the day, the\nweek, two weeks. Long-range planning is tough. Cancer time also seems to unfold as it is\ndoing now: 'honeymoon periods' of intense activity v. periods of fallow time. I've had to\nadjust to a completely different way of structuring my time (which is in part a feature of\nretirement): the academic calendar, semesters, portions of semesters, school holidays\netc. used to structure my time. No longer.\nLike Icarus' wings of feathers and wax, mine are flimsy, yet I still, often mistakenly,\nexpect that they will allow me to 'reach the sun,' to fulfill all my goals, realize my hopes\netc. It's not really a question of hubris in my case, but rather wishes, hopes, dreams, and\nimaginings that things might be 'like before.' They can't, and at times I still rebel against\naccepting this.  I almost passed out in a coffee shop near my mother's house yesterday,\ndue to a combination of feeling overheated in a small, crowded below ground coffee\nshop, dehydrated, slightly nauseous, and tired from standing for about 15 minutes to\nchat with a close friend I had run into in the coffee shop. Beyond this, my red blood cell\ncount is somewhat depressed from chemo.  This perfect storm forced me to slump down\ninto a chair, in a cold sweat, with my head on the table until I could get sufficient fluids\ninto me. The baristas called EMS! The nice EMS workers asked if I wanted to go to the\nhospital, but I definitely wanted to avoid this. Instead, the friend I had run into (my\nwonderful photographer friend Laurent, whom I've known for 41 years since he was my\nstudent in Avignon and whom I seem to run into on the street every time I'm in the city)\ninsisted on walking me home, arm in arm, to make sure I was ok. I lay down for a while\nwhen I got back to my mother's apartment and felt ok, but took it fairly easy for the rest\nof the day.\n                    \nThis morning I had planned to get up very early to head out to Brooklyn to see Ben run in\nthe Brooklyn half-marathon (the ostensible original purpose of this NY trip). But I slept\nvery poorly and had a bit of a stomach ache, so I gave up on that idea at about 6 a.m.\nand wrote Ben to tell him. I was extremely disappointed not to be able to check out the\nlively scene (20.000 runners!) and cheer Ben on, but feel I made the right decision,\nespecially foregoing standing amidst a huge crowd for hours.... My brother Ethan, who\nhad kindly agreed to meet me at Grand Army Plaza, did make it out there, snapping  a\npic of Ben as he ran past. Oh well. It's still hard to live with so much 'fomo,' and hard to\nchannel regret into acceptance rather than depression. Serenity is needed.\nI'm feeling ok, tired, stomach a bit queasy, but ok. Every other night or so I seem to\nsleep poorly and that is wretched. [p.s. For my friends I have plans to see in the city the\nnext two days, and then in State College, and then in Paris, I definitely want to meet up\nwith you - my friends are important to me - and feel well enough to do so. I just need to\nnot go too far afield and must get ample fresh air and water --- it's all good and I'll let\nyou know if that changes!]\nEvery day a gift, no matter what, must retain that. \nHave had some strange dreams recently. One featured my high school classmates, our\nband of 32 'sisters,' several of whom I will be blessed to reunite with soon (lunch with\nEva and Zia tomorrow; trip to Paris with Jill; dinner in Paris with Jill and our classmate\nChristina and her husband Vincent). In the dream I was late to an event at the\nschoolhouse on 92nd street (depicted extremely realistically in the dream). I saw myself\nrunning through the corridors and up the staircases of the school to get to the event,\nsome sort of ceremony in the auditorium (also appearing in exact detail!) in which my\nclass was participating or would be honored. Finally catching up to my class as it\nprocessed into the auditorium in a compact group, I noticed that the classmates were all\nstylishly dressed, yet I could really only see them from the back as I was following the\ngroup. Christina (whom we'll see in Paris) was wearing a chic off the shoulder dress in a\ncolorful pattern. Another classmate was wearing a white suit (skirt/jacket) in a crepe-like\nfabric. I looked good enough, but my outfit seemed *old-fashioned;* a maroon dress that\nreached to the knees or below, hair done fairly stylishly but nothing like the others. So\nthere I was, *behind the times, of another era, frozen in time in some sense, hoping to\ncatch up, hoping not to be left back.* I don't want to leave these girlhood friends - the\ndream was clear on that point.\nLast night's dream: I'm in a house that belongs to me but is unfamiliar. It's luxurious:\ntiling on the floor (as in an Italian villa), a long, elegant hallway with many rooms off it. I\nam tasked with showing it to Christina B., one of my former undergraduate students\n(who also participated in a trip I led to Paris). I was unfamiliar with the house and had\ntrouble finding the light switches so I could illuminate successive rooms and parts of the\nhouse. The first room we came to off a long hallway turned out to belong to my former\n                    \nbrother-in-law, Bruce (whose voice I may have heard 'offstage'). For some reason, today,\nthe Biblical verse \"In my father's house there are many rooms\" is stuck in my mind, but\nI'm not sure why. The other 'half' of this dream (presenting a contrast, but it's vague in\nmy memory) had to do with hospitalization, procedures, medical equipment,\nunpleasantness (and my connection to these), yet also a cake being left for me as a gift.\nPaging Dr. Freud?\nBen came home for over a week, which was wonderful. We enjoyed a meaningful seder,\nusing a new (to us) Haggadah by Marcia Falk, which has a much more feminist, current,\n'relatable' bent than our old school, ultra-patriarchal Haggadot (that instructs the 'master\nof the house' to perform various  ritual actions). The Haggadah drew attention to the role\nof women in the Exodus story and pondered why none of the women (except Miriam,\nbelatedly) are named, including Pharaoh's daughter, who raised Moses. The meal, which\nI had worked on intermittently for about two weeks, was delicious, and we enjoyed\nsinging some traditional songs (and some less traditional ones), including \"Miriam's\nSong,\" which we had introduced to Ben when he was little (he'll always know,\nconsequently, that a 'timbrel' is a tabmourine!). We also talked about the \"personal\nmizrayim\" (\"narrow places\") that we hope to be delivered from, and read a prayer for\nUkraine. The rest of the week Ben and I did our separate things -- he had class (online),\njob interviews, homework etc. while I had plenty of tasks and work to take care of. I\nintroduced Ben to the movie \"The Woman in Gold\" so he could learn about the history of\nlooted art in Vienna, where he'll be headed next month to visit Sammi; we also checked\nout several nights of NBA playoffs. He drove me to chemo, labs etc. and also to the city\nthis past Friday. I've always enjoyed the long car trips with Ben -- we listen to podcasts\n(\"The Daily\" and other NYTimes podcasts) and tunes, share lunch (the last of the matzah,\nmine with avocado spread) at a picnic site off Route 80, and shoot the breeze. This is\nwhere the best talks happen. :)\nAnother lesson from today: My son and my brother are here, and they will finish the race\nfor me.\nBe well, everyone.\n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "[Hi everyone, I am in Paris right now, having a great time -- and so far Covid free,\nyippee! -- but wanted to send this entry of which I wrote a draft on May 3, hoping to\nfinish before I left for France. The moving image changes quickly and the past several\nweeks have been most eventful, but I did want to at least get a short post off before I\nhave a chance to write more fully when I'm back. It's a gorgeous day in Paris, and I'm off\nto do a bit of present shopping before meeting my friend Doris in the Marais for lunch\noutdoors at La Terrasse des Archives. Then later, a drink with my friend David Drach at\nthe Cafe La Perle and dinner with my ride or die travel companion, Jill, at Breizh Cafe\n(among the best crepes in Paris, I'm told). As of today: Life is good!). XO\nI wanted to write a quick update on the eve of my departure for Paris tomorrow. It's been\nover a week since I've written. I do feel well enough to undertake the trip, despite all\nmanner of cancer-related symptoms. As per my labs, my magnesium levels were low so\nDr. Patel ordered magnesium infusions that wound up taking about five hours yesterday\nand today. Diarrhea is still a problem (and a worry, for all the reasons - I have lots of\nmedication with me!). The past few days, I've also been having some discomfort on the\nright side of my head (my 'bad' side): my skull feels stiff, tight and somewhat\nconstricted, I have some tenderness behind my ear and in a few other spots. The anxiety\nthat consumed me on Sunday abated considerably when one of the nurses messaged Dr.\nPatel on Monday; he ticked off the telltale signs of brain cancer recurrence (searing\nheadaches, blurry vision, balance problems), of which I have been experiencing *none.*\nToday he was in the office and was able to briefly come to the infusion room to examine\nmy head. He thinks my symptoms are related to post-op changes (yes, even after three\nmonths) -- perhaps the formation of scar tissue, perhaps some inflammation. If I had told\nhim sooner, he said, he likely would have ordered an MRI out of an abundance of\ncaution, and we'll probably move my brain scan up from mid- to early-June or late May.\nBut I only began fixating on my skull a few days ago, despite less recent (and maybe\nmilder?) symptoms. Meanwhile, I will travel with a veritable pharmacy of meds -\nOxycodone, a steroid, antibiotic etc. in case I become symptomatic. Energy level is\npretty good. In the moments when I stop being anxious I can hardly contain my\nexcitement.\nI feel like such a worry-wart. But please understand that very soon after my last trip to\nParis, three years ago, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I am nearly positive that I\nhad cancer already when in March 2019 I took eighteen students under my wing for a\ntransformative week of meetings with Auschwitz survivors, hidden children, historians,\nvisits to Holocaust memorials etc. I remember showering one morning in the hotel, my\nhands running over my bloated belly, a telltale sign of ovarian cancer. I've forgiven\nmyself for letting a serious health issue take the back seat to a once-in-a-lifetime study\ntour. But I still carry guilt and trauma with me. Hence, my anxiety.\nMany thanks to my friends Nancy, Sandy and John, the most recent contributors to the\n\"Reunite and Reignite\" initiative to help KEGOS. Please help *if possible;* I realize not\n                    \neveryone can, nor does everyone want to, for a range of valid reasons. I do not take this\n*in any way* personally. But I will continue to be a warrior for women's cancer care.\nGiven the uncertainty of so much in my life right now, this is one of the ways I feel I can\nhave real *agency* and empower myself to help other women with 'below the belt'\ncancers.\nMy recent trips to New York and Bedford Springs were memorable for my 'reunions' with\nvery dear friends from grade/high school, college and grad school. Why were these get\ntogethers so heart-warming? I'm not entirely sure! Whenever I'm with Eva, Zia, Mitchel,\nBryan, Vinni and Isa (et al - these were the friends I saw on this trip), I'm in a safe space.\nThe shared history, the road travelled, the coming of age together are all grounding. The\naffection. And I rarely *laugh* as hard as I do with the old friends. [I will add that of\ncourse it was wonderful to spend time with my mother -- we made a beeline for the pizza\nplace as soon as Passover was over -- Arnold, and Ben, with whom I drove to the city\nfrom State College].\nIn the city I had breakfast w/Bryan, a college friend and NYC kid like myself, at my go-to\ncoffee shop around the corner from my mother's, Sunburst. We talked about Paris (a city\nboth of us love, where we've also hung out together), classmates, our aging mothers,\ncurrent life/career goals and challenges. A nice morning!\nOn one occasion, you reach over and casually pick up a chunk of my scone from my\nplate. With other dear ones, we laugh hysterically, doubled over, nearly falling off our\nseats, our body movements signaling the many other times we've laughed this hard in\nthe past, all the goofy adventures. Friendship. :)\nThe ostensible reason for my trip to the city was Ben's participation in the Brooklyn half-\nmarathon. Unfortunately, I didn't sleep well Saturday night and consequently felt\nunsteady Sunday morning -- so I didn't make it. This depressed me, as the pre-cancer\nWilla would have had more stamina, poor sleep or not. Fortunately, my brother, with\nwhom I had planned to meet up at Grand Army Plaza, continued on to Brooklyn and\ncheered his nephew on, snapping a pic of him and even getting a low five from Ben as\nhe ran past. So glad that the valiant Ethan could be there. Ben finished the 13.1 mile\nrace along with several of his buddies, and their day continued on over beers and cheers\nand brunch in Brooklyn.\n \nMore soon! Greetings from my happy place! :)",

    "entry": "I don't have Covid, at least not yet. Nor am I symptomatic. I've consistently tested\nnegative since this past Monday, the day my dear friend and travel companion\nextraordinaire, Jill, tested positive for the virus, in Paris. Jill's comment (like me, Jill\nusually goes light on the swear words): \"Un-fucking-believable.\"\nI had finished a loong lunch (the way we like 'em) outdoors at the Terrasse des Archives\nMonday, catching up with my wonderful grad school friend Doris and indulging in my\n'one per trip' entretc\u00f4te frites, when I looked at my phone and saw a message from Jill:\n\"Can you please call me?\" Uh-oh. We were supposed to meet up later so that I could take\nher to dinner at Breizh Caf\u00e9, a well-known, highly recommended cr\u00eaperie in the Marais.\nBefore that I was to meet my friend David Drach for drinks at Caf\u00e9 La Perle nearby. I sat\non a bench in the \"Place des 260 Enfants\" deported from the Marais, which I've visited\nmany times with my students, and FaceTimed Jill. I found her propped up on a pillow\nagainst the bright floral wallpaper of her hotel room. \"Willa,\" she moaned, \"I tested\npositive.\" She was clearly distraught, more concerned about my catching it than having\nit herself (she's that caring and mindful a person). Apparently, she had been out\nshopping in the morning and had begun to feel ill (with cold symptoms) when she sat\ndown for lunch. She returned to the hotel, took a Covid home test, and voil\u00e0. Un-fucking-\nbelievable. Jill is of course vaccinated and boosted. We had taken pains to be careful in\nParis, masking upon entering stores and in Ubers, in the hotel etc. But undeniably we\nhad removed our masks to eat breakfast as well as fixings for one dinner bought at the\nmarch\u00e9 d'Aligre in the room designated for this purpose in the hotel, and in the street. I\n                    \nwas surprised by how few people appeared to mask in Paris, though (and perhaps it's no\nbetter in the States, but my impression is that in New York most people are more\nvigilant). When had Jill contracted COVID? From whom? Was I slated to be 'felled' next,\ngiven how much time we had spent together the past several days? Should I prepare for\nthe Covid-cancer whammy?\nJill suggested I might want to change my flights and leave earlier than planned, an idea I\npretty much dismissed out of hand as I was enjoying my week and somehow feeling\n'entitled' to it given the cancer-related challenges I had confronted to get to Paris. Over\nthe next twelve hours or so, on speaking with a few friends, and thinking through the\nsituation, I began to change my mind. My contracting COVID on top of cancer and being\nstuck in Paris was, in fact, my worst nightmare (and Dr. Beavis' as well). Of course, I felt\nterribly for Jill and didn't necessarily want to leave her to fend for herself. On the other\nhand, I had confidence in Jill's sensible nature and stability (although she was driven to\ntears at least once and if our situations had been reversed I'm convinced I would have\nbeen a blubbering mess at the outset), the support arriving from her husband in Cali, her\nthree grown daughters, her travel agent who had helped arrange the trip for us. the kind\nand helpful staff of our hotel, and, I hope, from me.\nIn any event, I did continue on to drinks with my friend David Drach (a dear, whose\nfather's film about the family's fate as French Jews during the Second World War, _Les\nViolons du Bal,_ I have shown many times to my students and who has travelled to Penn\nState several times to present it) and his newish boyfriend, Patrizio (hope I have that\nname right). It was wonderful to see him, but I felt distracted and stressed. Then, since I\nwas right near Breizh Caf\u00e9, I dined solo there, preoccupied by our Covid worries and\nunsure what to do. I walked back to the hotel (despite swollen ankles and feet, a problem\nthat concerned me all week, although I felt no pain from it, thankfully), stopping en route\nat a pharmacy place de la R\u00e9publique, which turned out to be open *24 hours/24,* a\nrelatively rarity in Paris. Outside the pharmacy a Covid testing site was set up. I\nexplained to the technician, a kind young woman in a hijab, that I had been exposed to\nCovid and wanted to be tested (antigen test, pretty much identical to the home test).\nShe had me fill out a form and then pay a 20 euro fee at the register in the pharmacy.\nShe then explained to me that the French test involves much more 'force' than the\nAmerican one, and that I should prepare myself for that. Indeed, she jabbed the swab\ndeep into my nasal cavity, leaving me gasping and pained. I was most thankful, though,\nfor the negative result, which she implied would likely persist (I was not sure I believed\nher fully on that, though, as I hadn't explained the entire chronology of the past several\ndays to her).\nBack at the hotel, Jill and I, although in adjacent rooms, FaceTimed each other, as we\nwould the next day, an absurdity that made us laugh in spite of ourselves.\nI slept poorly but my insomnia had the benefit of giving me time to formulate a plan to\n                    \nreturn home a day early, *provided* that I receive an official negative Covid test result,\nrequired in order to leave France. As I had an appointment at the Maison Vever at noon, I\nhad to move quite quickly Tuesday morning. So first I returned to the Covid testing site\nfor my 'official' test and again, miraculously to me, received a negative result, which I\nhad actually prayed/wished for. This time I would need to get on the same long line\n*twice* to pay. When I told the technician that I really preferred to pay for everything at\nonce (ie once for the test and then again for the official stamp and form), she was nice\nenough to eliminate one of my trips to the cash register. While awaiting my test result,\nnervously, I walked to the caf\u00e9 next door and ordered a caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me and a croissant,\nwhich I consumed while contemplating the massive statue of the French Republic in the\nmiddle of the square. Armed with my \"get of France free\" (or almost....) card, I then\nhurried back to my hotel a few blocks away, called United, and succeeded in booking the\nsame flight home a day earlier. When I was on hold w/United, I got on the Expedia\nwebsite and also changed the Newark>State College leg of my flight to a day earlier\ntoo.  Having taken care of these 'essentials,' I felt much better, as I had found myself\nsweating profusely most of the morning, when these arrangements were still in flux.\nSo...much...uncertainty. I had just enough time to contact my cousin Claudia and let her\nknow that I might have to cancel our dinner for Wednesday night (damn you, Covid) and\nalso let Mme Vever know that I might be a bit late for our noon rdv. I then FaceTimed Jill\n(in the next room) to see how she was feeling and whether she needed anything.\nJill is still in Paris. She isn't feeling too badly and tells me that her Covid feels more like a\ncold, at worst a mild flu. And every day she feels better. She spoke with Randy's doctor,\nwho looks hot btw (Randy showed me his photo!) and who Jill said was lovely (I had\ngiven her Dr. Mallet's number). The doctor wrote Jill a note in French and English\nenabling her to leave France next *Tuesday,* unless she tests negative before that. Jill's\ntravel agent helped her find a new hotel in the Marais (Jill had to change hotels as ours\nwas booked), and she's there now; she feels well enough to take short walks and buy\nherself food, medicine and other essentials. I feel terribly for her, but she's a trooper\n(and a fabulous travel companion, whom I will laud appropriately in another post!).\nI am back in State College. Irony #1: the United agent who checked my passport would\nnot have looked at my Covid status form, which she is supposed to check, if *I had not\nreminded her to do so.* In essence, I could have 'gotten through' without it (because of\nthis particular agent's oversight); presumably, Jill might have as well. Irony #2: after all\nthe precautions, tests, official forms etc. on my part, a woman sitting in the row behind\nme CDG to Newark had a hacking cough and coughed, spit up saliva, and remained\nunmasked during most of the seven-hour flight.\nWe live in strange times.\nMore to come.",

    "entry": "[I'm back in PA now, but catching up on everything, including rest, after a four back to\nback trip tear whose pace some friends have described as 'insane.' No plans to go\nanywhere for a while. I started this post a few days ago, in NY.]\nOnce again I'm writing 'out of order' as I still want to recount my previous trips (NY,\nBedford Springs, Paris). I'll get back to that. But today is a big day, as I'm in the city\n(once again) to celebrate Ben's graduation with an M.S. in Data Science from NYU over\nlunch for twelve in Chinatown (Ben is opting out of the actual ceremonies, both for the\nentire university -- at Yankee Stadium featuring Taylor Swift as speaker -- and for the\nMasters' candidates, at the Beacon Theatre uptown). The lunch -- my idea -- will bring\ntogether the Berkman and Silverman clans: Ben's parents (ie me and Michael) and\nstepmom (Sue), grandmother (Sharon) and Arnold, Ethan and family (Ronit), Michael's\nbrother Bruce, and three cousins (two Silverman, one Berkman, Eve, Isaac and Rachel).\nThirty-three years ago we celebrated my own graduation with a Ph.D. from NYU with a\nluncheon at a now defunct Italian restaurant on University Place. I remember it as\npleasant. My dad, of blessed memory, wore his own academic regalia as I wore mine that\nday; today, though, belongs to Ben, as we celebrate three generations of our affiliation\nwith NYU. And Michael was with us for lunch on graduation day in 1989 as he was to wish\nhis son well in 2022. We weren't married yet, but he helped me celebrate my\naccomplishment just as I travelled with him out to Bloomington that year to celebrate his\n(a loong road trip with an overnight in Columbus, Ohio). We miss Michael's parents too,\nand my dad. They would be kvelling.\nI am happy to be alive, to toast this happy moment with family and friends. My trip to NY\nlast month, overnight at the Bedford Springs resort with Vinni and Isa, and recent week\nin Paris were all 'shehecheyanu' occasions, colored by my gratitude for simply having\n*made it* to the day: \"Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Sovereign of all, who has kept\nus alive, sustained us, and brought us to this season.\" The four consecutive trips since\nlate April, taken together, have a somewhat 'breathy' quality to them. I'm tearing\nthrough what my oncologists have described as a 'window of opportunity' before my\nupcoming brain scan and pelvic/abdominal/chest CT, possible change in treatment plan,\nand lots of new question marks regarding my health and prognosis, all of which are\nmaking me anxious and, at times, depressed. These feelings are perhaps amplified a bit\nby Dr. Patel's brusqueness yesterday (in my perception); he intoned somewhat\nominously, re my upcoming scans, \"there will be findings,\" and, re my treatment, \"we'll\nrun out of options\" (neither of which are news to me, but somehow I expected a lighter\ntouch from him). I'm in frantic carpe diem mode (\"But at my back I always hear/Time's\nwinged chariot hurrying near.\"). I'm certainly feeling 'well enough,' or perhaps I simply\npowered my way through on some combination of adrenaline and #willapower. Yet I may\nalso be sensing in myself some undercurrent of panic, a need to keep moving at all\ncosts, to invoke a _perpetuum mobile,_ to dance on the edge of a volcano, to make\n                    \nmyself a moving target, to 'run on empty,' to ward off the inevitable (?), despite Dr.\nBeavis' observation that I \"sounded good\" in her response the note I sent  her yesterday,\naccompanied by a photo of me looking peppy and radiant in Paris. Catch me if you can...\nIf I keep busy, if I keep surrounding myself with loved ones, I reason, I'm safe. If I stay\nstill for too long, cancer will find me. Perhaps 'bringing the happy' is actually having a\nbeneficial effect on my health (or perhaps that's just magical thinking). Who knows? Just\npuzzling it all out can be exhausting. In the meantime, though, I plan to get out and\nenjoy this gloriously beautiful day in the city, fortified by a yummy cappuccino, nails\nmanicured with Opi's \"Princesses Rule\" polish and decked out in a new dress from Anne-\nElisabeth (one of last week's purchases in Paris).\n\"Well, after all is said and done\nI did all right, I had my fun\nI will walk before they make me\nI will walk before they make me run.\"\nThe gathering of the clans:\nOur dim sum lunch for twelve in Chinatown, on a glorious spring day under brilliant blue,\ncloudless skies,  was great fun. Clattering silver carts bore all manner of dumplings,\nsesame balls, rice cakes and cooling coconut and tofu desserts. If I can compliment\nmyself on two things (and God knows I have much to reproach myself for, too, over the\ncourse of my life), I will note my happiness over 1)my ability to, even talent for,\n*federating* disparate friends and family members during uplifting events such as these\n(for which I provided the impetus). Nothing makes me happier than to introduce\nmembers of my different friend groups in the hopes that they too might become friends. \nThis worked most marvelously in the case of Mitchel, my dear best friend from college,\nand Randy, a dear best friend from grad school. Introduced at a party at my mom's\napartment (I think) in the early 1980s, this pair became best friends themselves, thick as\nthieves, and the three of us form an unbreakable, 'ride or die' trio. Mitchel befriended a\nnumber of my grad school friends; there are crossovers between Mitchel, Randy and my\nhigh school friends, too. Although I'll be six feet under, literally or symbolically (haven't\ndecided yet), nothing would please me more (hint, hint) than the image of having all\nthese folks who are so important to me gathered together, with hope that their own\nfriendships will form or deepen, in perpetuity; 2)any small role I've played (and I believe\nI've worked hard for it, as have Michael and all others involved) in ensuring the success\nand continued health of such post-divorce gatherings. It was warming to see how\ngenuinely happy everyone seemed to be together (in some cases, after many years),\nhow relaxed everyone appeared, how much affection was visible (at least, that's how it\nseemed to me). I personally was delighted to chat with Michael's older brother, Bruce,\nwho I took to lunch in State College not that long ago, and his older daughter, Rachel\n(who was two at our wedding, now a lovely 31-year-old Pilates instructor living in the\n                    \ncity). Of course, Ben's graduation with an M.S. from NYU, his new job (one of five offers)\nand two-week trip to Vienna to visit Sammi (he just arrived this morning) all added up to\nan eminently \"the kids are alright\" moment, and Ben seemed...well, like Ben (kudos,\nBen, for your history of navigating potentially fraught family situations with ease and\ngrace, as you are so good at doing; we love you and you can count on your family's\nsupport). One big happy modern family! I rest easier knowing that Ben and Michael are\nand have always been extremely close and that Sue is an excellent stepmother. More\nthan me, Michael was often the one awake at 3 a.m. to change or comfort Ben in the\nmiddle of the night, hanging out with his baby to watch frisbee golf on t.v., the only\nreasonable option at 3 a.m. on a weekday.  I know I can count on them to watch over\nBen and also, I hope, to maintain my memory and continue to impart my values and life\nlessons.\nWe lingered outside the restaurant, snapping pictures and chatting. I love days when\ntime unspools in a most natural way, seemingly untethered to clocks or schedules or\n'conventional' time.\nMichael, Sue, Bruce, Ben and I then walked to NYU, where a sprawling, crowded street\nfair for the graduates filled Washington Square Park and the surrounding streets, awash\nin NYU violet splashed on regalia, signs, banners etc. We enjoyed iced coffee outside for\na while at a caf\u00e9 on Laguardia Place, at a table dwarfed by NYU's pink-red granite Bobst\nLibrary across the street. Memory dump:\n>It is 1974 and I have my first summer job, as a book shelver at Bobst. I am fifteen. To\nset it up, my father had spoken with the manager of Bobst, Mr. Flanagan, whom he knew\nslightly and whose daughter and her friends had nabbed the same job as me. These kids\nwere all (Irish) Catholic and had thick Long Island accents; I had never met anyone like\nthem before. Working with us was a big bunch of 'older' (college age?) folks, so different\nfrom me that I was taken way out of my upper-east-side girls' private school comfort\nzone in a good way: a nice couple, Richie and Emily, who took me under their wing, a\ngood-looking guy named Doug whom I had a crush on (according to my diary from that\nsummer, Doug was one of several of my coworkers who piqued my attention -- and vice-\nversa), a guy named Henry, just back from service in ....'nam (the war was still ongoing,\nso long ago...), a beautiful, delicate-looking man from Haiti, Jean, to whom I jabbered in\nmy best high school French, a guy named Calderon who taught me some Spanish, a guy \nnamed Sidney who had his own radio show on the NYU station, and others. My family\nhad been watching the Watergate hearings on t.v. that summer and I remember walking\nhome from Bobst the day Nixon was expected to resign, extremely worried about what\nwould happen to the country (it was the first time in my life, but certainly not the last,\nthat I sensed a threat to our democracy). I remember feeling grown up that summer\nsharing dinner, laughs, and perhaps an illegal beer for me with my coworkers at Factoria,\na 'fun' Italian restaurant near the Plaza (58th st.) with unlimited pasta and pitchers of\nbeer and sangria (a kind of Cheesecake Factory before its time?). The others invited me\n                    \nto continue our summer night in the city at a club, but in those days my parents still\nimposed a curfew...\n>It is about 1983 and Mitchel (then an NYU law student), Randy and I are studying at a\nlong table in a large room at the front of Bobst, overlooking Washington Square Park\n(this memory is faint).\n>It is summer 1985, and Vinni and I are back from a year in Paris, spending the summer\nstudying for our Ph.D. comps in October before heading back to Paris for another year.\nWe grind and cram all day, emerging only at lunchtime, a bit dazed, for a break under\nthe sweltering July New York sun. We try to find shade on a bench in the park for a while\n(I remember buying Sabrett hot dogs for lunch from a cart on the corner), testing each\nother on both random facts as well as themes we might need to be conversant with for\nour exams (\"History of anticlericalism in France; go!\"). Then back into the air-conditioned\nlibrary for a few more hours.\n>2018 (sometime in first half): A seasoned researcher and author by this point, I spend\nabout a week in Bobst's rare book room, reading the records of Gilded Age New Yorkers\nwho employed the upscale caterer Louis Sherry for their luncheons and dinners, this for\na project on 19th century Franco-American culinary exchanges. I still head out to the\nbenches in Washington Square Park at lunchtime and get lost in people watching.\nBen and I peeled away from Bruce, Michael and Sue and checked out the street fair, then\nsat on a bench in WSP for a while (it still reeks of pot, much as I remember from my\nteenage years). We then continued on to my mother's (all in all, a good 2+ mile walk for\nme that day), where we hung out until Ben had to go on to a graduation party in Bklyn.\nA good day.

    "entry": "I guess I've sort of bought into the narrative spun by Drs. Beavis and Patel, of a \"window\nof opportunity\" dutifully taken advantage of during my four successive trips, a sort of\n'victory lap' or 'hail and farewell' before all-important scans and then some sort of\n'descent' (Dr. Patel on the upcoming scans: \"There will be findings.\" Dr. Beavis: \"I may\nwant to start you on Avastin after the scans\" -- Avastin, the drug with a 5% risk of bowel\nperforation, perhaps a higher risk in my case because of my fistula operation, a bowel\nperforation that would mean, per Dr. Beavis, \"game over\"). So that's why I lay awake\nagain last night, consumed by thoughts of my mortality: how do I arrange for a 'green\nburial?' Ensure that specific pieces of jewelry are given to certain individuals? Work out\nall the financials, beyond the basics of my will? I feel 'well enough,' despite being\n                    \nincreasingly concerned by discomfort and stiffness on the right side of my skull (the\nsurgery side) that has bothered me for about a month. While Dr. Patel and Dr.\nBettegowda's PA, both of whom I queried about this before leaving for Paris, told me that\nthey thought the skull stiffness and discomfort was attributable to 'post-op changes'\n(even up to four months after the fact?...) rather than cancer (I have none of the\nrecognizable brain cancer symptoms: headaches, double vision, balance problems), Dr.\nPatel (who even briefly examined my skull before I left for Paris) now wants me to have a\nbrain/head MRI asap. Consequently, I've moved my MRI up to this Friday from June 13, at\nthe ungodly hour of 5:30...a.m.! Driving to the hospital at that hour should\nbe...interesting (I'll need to keep my eyes sharply focused on any deer that may cross\nmy path), although the sun will be out by the time I'm done, just in time for me to head\nto...chemo. Oy. I don't know what's up with my head/brain/skull but I hope it doesn't get\nworse (I may try to move my MRI up to even sooner). I also hope I haven't waited too\nlong to act, but was relying, perhaps erroneously, on what my doctors had told me\n(including Dr. Patel the younger's statement that there was only a 15% of my brain\ncancer recurring). I'm fairly consumed by anxiety about this, as you can likely tell.\nAs I shared with my friend Jackie, who picked me up from chemo on Friday (we always\nget right to some quality conversation in the car), I was unhappy with Dr. Patel's\nbrusqueness the previous day. This is a trait I detected in him from the outset, but it\nseemed to have mellowed the more I got to know him. When I asked him to what he\nmight attribute the stiffness in my skull, he barked \"I need a test!\" He sees so many\npatients that he seemed to have forgotten basics about my treatment, including which\ndrug I'm currently receiving! And perhaps he was simply having a bad day; he expressed\nfrustration to me about another ovarian cancer patient he's seeing, who is refusing\ntreatments that would benefit her and whose husband seems completely clueless about\nhis wife's condition. \"It's very challenging,\" said Dr. Patel. I can only imagine (but please\ndon't take your frustration out on me!). Meanwhile, Dr. Beavis is in Spain on a well-\ndeserved bike trip and won't be back for a while. Dr. Stephanie Wethington, who I know\na bit from Hopkins, is in charge of Dr. Beavis' patients while she's away, and my\nimpression is that, like the entire KEGOS team, she's extremely competent, kind and\nresponsive. If there's a problem, I will contact her.\nDespite my fatigue, I managed to do some work today then, as I like to do, took a long,\nrelaxing drive in the country in search of fresh produce. This led me down the bumpy\ndriveways of Amish farms every time I saw a sign for \"Asparagus,\" now abundant, as is\nrhubarb (I'm thinking chilled asparagus soup tomorrow, and an omelet w/asparagus and\ncheese tonight). I'm the rhubarb 'queen' so can always find a use for the fresh pink fruit.\nAlso bought some fresh eggs. I love these little roadside farm stands that operate on the\nhonor system. Take what you need and leave the $ in a cash box; the family's likely\nplanting or plowing the field (with teams of horses!).\nWriting about my recent trips also boosts my morale, so please indulge me (or skip this\n                    \nsection if you prefer). It's all about keeping the 'good' and 'bad' in balance. The bleak\nmoments make the fabulous ones even sweeter; the fabulous ones make the bleak time\neasier to handle, as there's such an accumulation of stuff to be grateful for. See series of\npictures above: 1-3. Wonderful reunion lunch in the city with my high school pals Eva\nand Zia. While I've seen Eva (blonde) and Zia (dark hair) separately not too long ago --\nEva in East Hampton this summer as she lives year-round in Sag Harbor, Zia via Zoom\non several occasions during the pandemic -- the three of us hadn't been together in\nyears. We had so much fun reminiscing and catching up over tapas at Boqueria in the\nFlatiron district. Both Eva and Zia entered Nightingale in about eighth grade; perhaps I\nfelt some kinship with them because our families engaged in artistic/intellectual\nprofessions unlike the Mad Men professions many of our classmates' fathers seemed to\nexemplify -- the well-known art movie house, Angelika, was named after Eva's mother,\nAngelika Saleh, and her father was a film producer; Zia's mother is the Indian cooking\n'guru,' Madhur Jaffrey while her father (stepfather), Sanford Allen, was the first Black\nviolinist in the NY Philharmonic, and a prominent, highly talented one at that. Zia and I\nboth lived way downtown, far from the pristine Upper East Side where many of our\nclassmates lived; Eva and I were both Jewish. I'm sure  our classmates' reality was much\ndifferent than the way I perceived it at the time, but nevertheless I often felt marginal vis\n\u00e0 vis the dominant NBS culture. Eva and Zia were partners in crime, engaging with me in\nall sorts of kooky mischief (much of which cannot be divulged here!); confidants (all\nthose sleepovers! all that laughter!); and later, cherished, trusted friends. Zia and I have\nalways bonded over writing, including a few tentative joint writing efforts; she's a\ntalented published author, and a writing teacher at the New School. I hope the pictures\nconvey how happy we were to spend time with one another. As Zia and I were seated\ntoo far away from each other across the table to give one another a hug during the\nphoto, we held hands and lifted them in a kind of triumphant 'salute,' and then giggled\nabout it.\nPictures 4-5. As soon as my mother opened the door to her apartment to welcome\nMitchel, I knew I'd hear his warm, energetic, enthusiastic voice: \"It's so good to see\nyou!!\" Then I knew I'd get the biggest, tightest hug ever. My first real friend in college,\nMitchel and a female pal of his befriended me my freshman year (they were\nsophomores) in a class we were taking on Proust. I was the only freshman in the class,\nreally way out of my league. I barely opened my mouth the entire semester. Mitchel and\nhis friend took me under their wing, inviting me to parties and showing me much\nfriendliness. When I was twenty, Mitchel and I travelled Italy north to south, a memorable\ntrip. We overlapped for several years at NYU, and have always visited with one another\neither in NY, Paris (often with our friend Randy), or Nice (where Mitchel now lives with his\npartner, Fabien). Mitchel has a gift for friendship and laughter; here we are sitting on a\nbench in St. Mark's Place in the Village (we had had a lovely lunch near my mom's\napartment, and had then walked over to Veselka, where I bought a quart of their\ndelicious mushroom barley soup). We had just taken this selfie and were accusing one\nanother of looking 'feeble,' heads cocked awkwardly, odd smiles, and eyes looking\n                    \naskance. For some reason, we both found this vision of us as feeble hysterical and were\nliterally nearly falling off the bench, doubled over in laughter. The second picture of us,\non the couch in my mother's living room, contains all the love, connection, silliness, and\nmemories of a beautiful friendship. :)\n\"These fragments I have shored against my ruins.\"\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Am still catching up, and for the moment seem to be veering into diary writing as a\n\"preserving memories\" exercise rather than a means for providing health\nupdates, pace Caring Bridge. But the two are in fact related, as mentioned in my last\nentry. I'm in a bit of a funk, concerned about the stiffness in my skull as I await my MRI\non Friday (no earlier appointments available this week as of this morning), have written\nto all my doctors (depressed that Dr. Patel the younger never responded to a message I\nwrote him on *May 2* to discuss the concern about my skull), have considered then\nrejected the possibility of going to the ER here (truly a place of last resort for me, unless\nthe situation becomes intolerable). A bunch of my friends are away for the summer or a\ngood part of it (while others, thankfully, are here) and I feel isolated in my worry, vox\nclamantis in deserto. Nevertheless, I managed to do some work this morning, my brain\nappears to be functioning in terms of cognition and memory, and I feel nowhere near as\nill as I did when my friend Martina kindly drove me to Lewistown hospital for an MRI in\nJanuary, and from there I was life-flighted to Hopkins....\nIt's summer, and I'd love to be travelling or out in nature, in abundant good health. Oh\nwell. Must hold on to the good memories from the past few weeks.\nI wonder if I'm writing in my journal too much. Today, it's diverting me, calming me,\nproviding me with an interlocutor, lifting my mood a bit. But I don't want to bring anyone\ndown with this.\n*Update just now: Dr. Patel the younger's office just messaged me and asked me to\ncome in for an appointment tomorrow at 2 p.m. in case I need a prescription from him as\na radiation oncologist. I will do this! The fact that they are not telling me to go to the ER\nimmediately makes me feel somewhat relieved.\nI knew that among the friends or groups I wanted to spend time with these days my grad\nschool friends would have pride of place. There's something about the intensity of the\nrange of  experiences we shared from approx 1982 to 1988, in addition to all the dinner\nparties, outings, travel (two years in Paris for me and Vinni, plus London, Madrid...),\nlaughter, adventures, life milestones, illnesses, new jobs, children (many sons!) etc.\nwe've experienced together, that has created an unshakeable bond among us as friends,\nwomen, colleagues. Further, this group of (mainly) women friends has been\nextraordinarily caring to me throughout my illness. I am so very grateful.\nI concocted a plan to treat my 'filles' to a weekend in the country (chez moi), including\nan overnight at Omni Bedford Springs Resort and Spa, a pretty ritzy resort about 1.5\nhours from here, which in the late 19th c. was the site of a 'wellness retreat' for well-\nheeled patrons, due to the many mineral springs in the area. I had stayed at the hotel\nonce, which is chock full of memorabilia and photos recalling the resort's past as a place\nfor 'taking the waters.' As many of my grad school friends are devotees of the c. 1900\nera, I thought this would be a great choice for us, and we've always been in favor of all\n                    \nsorts of indulgences over the years (most recently, purchasing, when we have the\nmeans, specific porcelain patterns, original posters from the c. 1900 era etc.). So a 'girls\nspa day' seemed like an appropriate treat.\nTwo friends, Harriet and Shanny, were unfortunately unable to make the trip. Shanny\nsurely would have brought her crystal pendulum for us to interrogate, her intention-\nsetting cards, and her irreverent humor (she's the one who instructs us -- all of us\nlifelong scholars of France, one of us French -- to yell \"Fuck France\" instead of \"Cheese\"\nor even \"Fromage\" when our picture is taken). But Vinni, Isa and I had plenty of laughs;\nin fact, we've been laughing, crying, and everything in between together for forty years.\nOur invented franglais lexicon includes the terms \"frapper la route\" (\"hit the road\"), \"sac\nde louches\" (\"scumbag\") and, as of our most recent visit, \"sans clou\" (\"clueless\"). For\nanyone in the know, these are literal translations of French phrases and are completely\nmeaningless and inane, nevertheless sending us into gales of side-splitting laughter, as\ndo all our numerous 'in jokes.' Maybe you just had to be there...\nVinni and Isa drove to my place from Isa's in Montclair, NJ (Vinni lives near Boston and\nhad flown to Newark, then met up with Isa for the drive), and we spent the evening\nchatting over ap\u00e9ro and dinner before it was time for bed. One or the other of us kept\n'losing' her cell phone in my house; highly competent women, we can all nevertheless be\na bit ditzy when we're together... The next morning we breakfasted then fortified\nourselves with coffee from Caf\u00e9 Lemont (to which these ladies had kindly offered me a\ngift certificate, knowing I love this caf\u00e9's cappuccino, made with milk from a local dairy).\nWe sat outside in the sun at the caf\u00e9 for a bit, before we decided to \"frapper la route.\"\nWe enjoyed a wonderful day at Bedford Springs: lunched outdoors (weather was lovely)\nand later enjoyed Prosecco on the same outdoor patio; hiked one of the many trails to\nthe 'limestone spring;' dined at a good Italian restaurant in the cute town of Bedford;\nchecked out some of the c. 1900 artefacts from the resort; toasted marshmallows and\nmade 'smores at the fire pit; drank champagne and were silly (think feather boas!) in our\nhotel rooms.\nThe spa was very 'ooh la la' and smelled divine. We were given a tour of the different\nbaths and related relaxation spaces and then had time to enjoy them: first, an energizing\nshower called \"Le D\u00e9luge\" (apr\u00e8s moi le d\u00e9luge?) stocked with the heavenly-smelling\n(and pricey) products sold in the spa shop; then, the steam room; next, a hot whirlpool\nbath; and finally, a cold bath (I was too wimpy to try that). We cycled through the series\nof pools and saunas a few times; the decor, fittingly, was again 'Gilded Age' with all\nmanner of refreshing flavored waters and fresh fruit available throughout the spa. Before\nmy pedicure, I relaxed in the lounge, a large space outfitted with chaise lounges, potted\npalms, small treats to eat and drink, fluffy white robes to wear. Ahh... No massage or\nfacial for me (unlike for Vinni and Isa) as any manipulation of my lymph nodes is not\nadvisable for me. But my shiny purple toes are a great look for summer!\n                    \nAfter our spa morning, we had lunch at the hotel restaurant before Vinni and Isa took off\nfor Newark airport and I drove home (in pouring rain).\nTwo years ago we had a lovely time at Kripalu Yoga Retreat in the Berkshires, this year\nwe blissed out at Bedford Springs. Where to next time, beautiful and brilliant ladies? It's\nguaranteed to be a blast. And in the meanwhile, if any State College (or other) friends\nwould like to join me for a trip to Bedford Springs (en route to D.C.; easily accessible\nfrom Baltimore and Pittsburgh), please lmk!\nPhotos",

    "entry": "When evil manifests itself so blatantly, I sometimes (fleetingly) think that death will be a\nrelief from such a cascade of atrocious news. I remember feeling this way in regard to\ncertain friends or relatives who have died (eg \"I'm so glad X didn't live to experience\nSeptember 11th;\" I'm so glad my father didn't know most of the horrors of the Trump\npresidency\" \u00ab Or Covid. \u00bb). I woke up crying today thinking about the massacre of\nchildren and teachers in Texas. The last time I remember literally waking up crying was\nwhen Trump won the presidency in 2016. And yet, of course, we must go on, and must\ndo what we can to protest this inhuman, evil, obscene aspect of our culture (if my health\nholds, I'll definitely put my time behind our critical PA elections in Nov.). And yet, love\nabounds as well, as I can attest. Choose the blessing over the curse... (Deuteronomy\n30:19).\nSomewhat perversely, today I snapped pics of some of our many local gun shops, on the\nsame road about ten miles out of this progressive university town. Outside one of them,\na sign is proudly, almost brazenly unfurled: \"God, Guns, Trump.\" That pretty much says it\nall, doesn't it? Don't tell me gun control is not a political issue. Then needed to drive way\nout into the country, amidst the rolling hills and farm stands (fifteen stalks of freshly cut\n                    \nrhubarb for $2, anyone?), to begin to clear my mind, haunted by the niggling feeling that\nin these parts 'quaint' and 'picturesque' often (but not always) translate to conservative,\nright-wing (if the road signs are any indication).\nHealth update: I was able to get an appointment yesterday with my neuro-oncologist's\nPA to address the continuing stiffness in my skull and upper neck. I was relieved that her\ndiagnosis pointed to inflammation rather than the \"C word;\" she told me that\ninflammation can often occur in the skull/brain/head at any point after brain surgery and\nradiation, even this far out. She prescribed steroids for me and perhaps just the relief of\nhaving some understanding of what may be going on helped me sleep last night. I don't\nfeel, at this point for example, that I need to rush to the ER. Of course, more will be\ndetermined from my MRI, scheduled for this Friday. I will then have a neck CT Friday,\nJune 3 (I actually requested this to address 'puffiness' in my neck, perhaps also caused\nby inflammation per the PA) and an abdominal/pelvic/chest CT in mid-June. After these\nimportant scans, a determination will be made about my treatment, eg continue with\nweekly Taxol alone or add Avastin; some other option that I may not be aware of.\nKnowing that I'm running out of viable treatment options, I will also do a bit more of my\nown research on available clinical trials, but those options may be limited for me. In my\nfantasy, the situation will be as it has been with my gums: I've been at risk for gum\nsurgery for years, but somehow have 'held on,' with my gum recession unchanged, for\nmany years, just on the precipice in relation to the maximum erosion tolerable before a\npainful gum graft is prescribed.  My dentist and I have gotten a laugh out of my 'hanging\non by a thread' for years; it's quite remarkable. Wouldn't it be nice if my cancer could\n'hold steady' as well? Perhaps I am an outlier. Who knows? We'll find out more soon. Dr.\nBeavis has checked in with me from Spain and is definitely on top of the latest\ndevelopments, as is Dr. Patel.\nI'm concerned for Brenda R., my college classmate who is surviving Stage 4 ovarian\ncancer. As I've mentioned, I did not know Brenda in college (unfortunately) but was\nintroduced to her fairly recently by another Brenda (P.). Brenda R. and I have zoomed\nand check in with one another periodically. Brenda reported a few days ago that she's\nbeen in the hospital every month since November, sleeps a lot, and is closely watched by\nher two sisters, both staying with her. Her doctors say they've never seen anyone at her\nadvanced stage survive so long. \"Not that I'm going for any records!\" Brenda quipped to\nme, her text accompanied by several 'laugh' emojis. Yeah, sometimes all we can do is\nlaugh! You go, Brenda, warrior sister. You are in my thoughts. \nDespite yesterday's tragedy, I am grateful for this pretty day (although actually a bit\ncloudy in the end), for being in touch with a number of friends, and for a pretty drive in\nthe country. Nice memories -- \"no, no, they can't take that away from me.\"\nI am working through emails and texts that accrued during my trips, and writing\neveryone back in order, more or less. My apologies for the delays. I hope you will hear\n                    \nfrom me soon!\nThis was going to be a post about my Paris trip, but I'm still too overwhelmed by the\nthought of children being murdered. But I do want to write about Paris too. A good\nproject for the holiday weekend.\n \n \n*******************************************",

    "entry": "Yesterday was grueling. Despite my best efforts to package an alarm set for 3:50 a.m. to\nbegin my day as an 'adventure,' it wasn't fun. I was up by 4:00 a.m. after about two\nhours of sleep, ate a bowl of yogurt topped with homemade strawberry rhubarb sauce\nand turned my attention to the NYTimes Spelling Bee (miraculously I attained \"Genius\"\nlevel at that hour; I'm a faithful Bee girl, sorry all you Wordle fans). Blessings on Ben,\nwho texted me around 4:30 to wish me well. Although six hours *ahead* of me with\nSammi in Budapest, he had not yet eaten breakfast, but then sent me a photo of the\nyummy looking *Israeli* breakfast they were sharing near their Airbnb in the Jewish\nquarter of Budapest. Go figure. Many thanks to those who sent very early morning (or\neven day before) texts or emails conveying well wishes. You know who you are. I greatly\nappreciated them as 4:30 a.m. is an isolating time, at least for me.\nI drove to the hospital in a dark rain; as I approached, a few more cars appeared on the\nroad. A brain MRI is not fun; fortunately, I'm not highly claustrophobic, but the hour's\nworth of jackhammering and blaring sounds swirling around my head as the images\nwere being captured is jarring. Luckily, I was still pretty much half asleep, yet also\nfixated (once again) on my process for picking out certain of my jewelry pieces to give to\nspecific people. I had a few copies of the images made on discs to send to Drs. Beavis,\nPatel and Bettegowda. It still astounds me that it seems so complicated for the hospital\nhere in State College to push the images forward to Dr. Patel the elder, also in State\nCollege yet working for a different medical system, Geisinger Health.\nI might mention that my brain MRI was scheduled for a few weeks from now at a more\nreasonable hour, but I decided to move it up once what is increasingly seeming like\ninflammation, manifesting itself as a 'stiffness' in my skull, began to bother me. A steroid\nI'm taking for that problem appears to be helping a lot, thankfully! I'm feeling much less\ntenderness on the right side of my head, and can sleep on my right side now too.\nI emerged from the hospital as the sun was rising and drove home, then crashed on my\nbed for about two hours, before I had to wake up again to go to chemo. My stalwart\nneighbor, Janis, drove me, while my equally kind friend Jackie drove me home. By then it\nwas about 3 p.m.; all the caf\u00e9s with decent coffee were closed, so I opted for a swing\npast Meyer's dairy and a small sundae with mint chip ice cream. My eating yesterday\nwas as odd and untimely as my sleeping, but I just allowed myself to indulge in\nwhatever, whenever. Chemo and a magnesium drip proceeded smoothly; my neuropathy\nwas bothering me so I found I couldn't get into a comfortable position for sleeping, but\nmust have dozed for a bit as on awakening I felt disoriented about my whereabouts.\nAt some point a chemo nurse came over to my bay and let me know that the hospitals'\nradiologists had read the report on my MRI and, thank goodness, everything appears to\nbe clear. No clear signs of new cancer nor any other significant finds. This is certainly\n                    \ngood news, but I haven't worked up the courage to read the report myself yet and Dr.\nPatel was out yesterday. I may read it this weekend or may wait to 'bundle' the scan\nreports for a more 'holistic' explanation from my medical team (next scan, on my neck at\nmy request to check out the puffiness there, will take place next Friday; the third, on my\nabdomen/pelvis/chest, to be done on June 13th). For the moment, though, it *appears*\nas if I won't have to deal with a brain/ovarian cancer whammy, which doesn't mean my\ncancer won't recur in my brain at some point, and which also doesn't mean that I won't\nhave to contend with other metastases (as I am already with regard to several lymph\nnodes, colon etc.). We move forward, in the meanwhile, and enjoy these short reprieves\nright now as much as possible.\nAfter Jackie brought me home, I once again crashed on my couch, this time waking up\naround 9 p.m.! I turned on the Celtics-Heat game and ordered some Indian food off Grub\nHub (my stomach feels a bit yucky today). Exciting game, unlike some of the lackluster\nplay I've seen in this series. I miss the days of Jordan and Magic - who wouldn't miss that\nthrilling level of play? -- and of course the beloved Knicks teams of my 20s and 30s\n(Ewing, Mase, Oakley etc.), but I do enjoy watching Steph Curry (who'll be waiting for the\nwinner of the Celtics-Heat Game 7 on Sunday) and Jayson Tatum play.\nI was in bed by midnight and slept well and soundly, waking up once around 4 a.m. After\na day spent totally out of whack, my Circadian rhythms seem to be back to normal.\nStayed in bed until 10 a.m., then went to Caf\u00e9 Lemont for an iced cappuccino, gassed up\nmy car, and headed out on what proved much easier to present to myself as an\nadventure: a long drive to Milroy, Reedsville and Belleville in search of fresh produce.\nThis long drive (75 miles for the day?) involved many treks down gravel roads to tucked\naway farms; slowing down for all manner of Amish carts and buggies; stopping at\nnumerous roadside stands; conversations with the Amish farmers (invariably surrounded\nby a gaggle of sweet-faced, curious children); working out rough calculations of prices for\nthe foodstuffs, often picked right out of the garden (strawberries!). I bought some\ndelicious looking asparagus, more rhubarb, a hothouse tomato, and a big jar of\nunpasteurized cream (hopefully devoid of bacteria that might harm my fragile\nstomach?). I love going to farmers markets, but also very much enjoy dealing directly\nwith the farmers on their farms and their ethic of sustainability. No chemicals, all natural,\nplots tilled by hand or larger ones by horses etc. We'll see what tastiness I'll hopefully\nconcoct from these products. In my heart, I'm a city girl for sure, but the mellow\ncountryside, network of gurgling streams, acres of green fields, silos, old barns and quiet\nbalance me.\nHaving brunch with a friend tomorrow, outdoors, then maybe some cooking and\nplanting. Two defenses coming up in next two weeks, so currently reading two\ndissertations awaits. Onwards.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "As my week in Paris was a designated part of my 'wellness therapy' consisting of a return\nto my 'happy place' after three years away, I do want to leave a trace of it here. Despite\nmy coming very near to not making the trip for fear of contracting COVID or having my\ncancer worsen there, I am of course overjoyed to have taken advantage of this 'window\nof opportunity,\" so designated by my medical team. Mann Tracht, Un Gott Lacht: Man\nPlans, God Laughs. Despite myriad precautions (near constant masking, bags of\nmedications crammed into my suitcase, lists of Parisian doctors' names and numbers in\n                    \nmy purse etc.), Jill came down with COVID on our fifth day in Paris, leaving me to depart\na day early while she was required to remain in Paris an extra week until she tested\nnegative (in fact, I believe she received a written note from my friend Randy's physician -\nwhom he dubs \"Dr. Love\" [don't ask] - stating that she'd be asymptomatic after a week:\nanother 'get out of France' card). After Monday I never saw the poor woman again, but\nhad to resort to FaceTiming her in the room next to mine! Through it all -- sitting across\nfrom Jill in enclosed indoor restaurants and breakfast rooms, sharing a dinner with her\nshopped for at a local market -- I never tested positive for COVID. Go figure. Maybe in\nthis sense things did 'work out' as my contracting Covid as a cancer patient in Paris\ncould have yielded catastrophic results for me, but of course I felt terribly for Jill, and was\nloath to leave her alone. She's all better now, back in Cali with her husband and with her\nthree adult daughters checking in regularly, and we've had a good laugh about our\n(mis)adventure. I'm sure it brought us closer in some way. Mann Tract, un Gott Lacht: at\nthe airport flying home, I had to *remind* the attendant to check the results of my Covid\nscreening for my negative result. I'm quite sure I could have sailed through precheck\nwithout this apparently vital control.\nSpeaking of Jill, she was a wonderful travel companion. And friend.  We had never\ntravelled together, but she had kindly visited me in PA during an earlier stage of my\ncancer journey to help me out, driving here from her daughter's home in Princeton, NJ.\nWe've seen each other here and there over the past few years, over drinks in the city\n(where she has an apartment), at the memorial service for another classmate, and have\nkept in touch, but were likely not one another's very closest friend (ie we had drifted out\nof one another's lives a bit). Not only is Jill a seasoned traveler, completely on top of our\nlogistics, helpful to me when I flagged physically during our long wait at CDG passport\ncontrol, security etc., not only was she laid back and agreeable (while always looking\nultra-stylish), happy to accompany me to favorite spots, neighborhoods, museum etc.\nwhile also striking out on her own with complete confidence at other times (her French,\nremembered from her studies at the Lyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais in NY, was completely sturdy). She is\nalso a wonderful and interesting and and kind and smart and fun friend (a UCLA MBA and\nformer Tufts undergrad, she runs her husband's law office in Calabasas). Every time we'd\nsit down to dinner or at a caf\u00e9, I knew there'd be no lack of things to discuss, not just\nabout our trip but also about our families of origin (whom we both knew versions of from\nour high school days) and families we've created, lives, careers, Jewish identities, travels\netc. What a blessing to reconnect with my girlhood friend in these circumstances. Jill,\nthank you for offering to be my travel buddy. You deserve every iota of the lovely life\nyou and Fred have created for yourselves and your family. I would travel anywhere with\nyou!\nA highlight for us may have been dinner with *another* of our high school classmates\n(remember, there were only 23 of us so it's really a sisterhood), Christina, and her\n                    \ncharming French husband, Vincent. While I've met up with Christina, who excels at\nteaching and touring Paris with American students on study abroad programs, each time\nI'm in Paris, Jill had not seen her in many years. We laughed when we realized we were\nsitting outside at a caf\u00e9/bistro underneath a sign marked \"Produits frais\" (\"Fresh\nProducts\") and Vincent took a few whimsical pictures of me with a giant teddy bear at\nthe caf\u00e9, one of the omnipresent \"Ours des Gobelins\" (kind of therapy bears to help\nParisians through the pandemic), a lovely touch in often whimsical Paris (https://www.sor\ntiraparis.com/news/in-paris/articles/180876-the-phenomenon-of-the-giant-teddy-bears-at-\nles-gobelins-neighborhood-in-paris/lang/en).\nWhat I loved best was a week spent appropriating the Parisian space, cutting a swath\nthrough 'my' Paris, the one I've come to love particularly over the years, revisiting\nplaces, tastes, smells, sensations - and people - that make me happy. The weather was\nmagnificent. I loved sitting in the mellow sunshine under that \"certain slant of light\" at\nabout 6 p.m., either in the beautiful courtyard of the MAHJ (Jewish Museum) or relaxing\nover a drink (I couldn't overdo it, but did allow myself some wine and a Campari spritz --\nalong with lots of Perrier menthe, my refreshing go-to drink on hot days in Paris). I loved\nsitting with Doris in small gardens tucked off to the side of the Archives nationales, which\nI discovered a few years ago. I absolutely loved renewing my habit of spending Sunday\nmorning at the march\u00e9 d'Aligre, tasting samples of fresh fruits, buying favorite foods,\nvisiting the covered march\u00e9 Beauveau, the large outdoor market, and the flea market\n(my 'scarf lady,' Martine, remembered me!), ducking into wonderful fromageries along\nthe rue d'Aligre, stopping for a coffee and people watching, buying a sweet pain brioch\u00e9\nin an excellent bakery, enjoying life.\nFriends: I prioritized, in part, seeing friends as I knew that would make me happy and\nwanted to catch up with and check in with my oldest pals - a high school friend, college\nand grad school friends, French colleagues who have become friends. I certainly would\nhave liked to have seen others but was careful not to run myself ragged - and I did as\nmuch as I thought I was able to in six days, without tiring myself too much. Aside from\ndinner with Jill, Vincent and Christina, I had a lovely lunch with my dear friend Doris (one\nof our group of 'filles' from grad school at NYU) at the Caf\u00e9 des Archives in the Marais;\nhad a drink with my filmmaker/actor friend David Drach, with whom I've nourished a\ntranslatlantic friendship for a good ten years, also in the Marais (and met his new\nboyfriend); unfortunately, I had just learned of Jill's Covid diagnosis so was feeling upset\nand distracted...; enjoyed dinner at a lovely boutique bistro, La Pharmacie (in a\nrenovated 19th c. pharmacy), with my colleague and friend Vincent Duclert (whom I first\nmet in about 1995 (?) when I showed up in a rainstorm at the Archives nationales where\nhe was then working, my socks drenched; Vincent procured dry socks for me somehow. I\nalso credit Vincent for introducing me to the chocolate shop Jadis et Gourmand in the rue\ndes Archives, from which he had been gifted that day a giant 'message board' composed\nof tablets of milk and dark chocolate, which he shared with me, spelling out something\nlike \"F\u00e9licitations!\" -- there have been many causes for congratulations over the years in\n                    \nVincent's eminent career as an historian, but in those days we were both still starting\nout). Now my friendship with Vincent includes his delightful and kind American wife,\nDiana, who unfortunately could not join us for dinner that evening); and spent a number\nof hours over drinks and dinner at Mensae in Belleville with my 'ride or die' partners in\ncrime, Mitchel and Randy (my friends from college and grad school). Our 'Three\nMousquetaires' reunions since the early 1980s (and of course Mitchel and I go back\nfurther), taking us through the Village, Paris, Nice and elsewhere, don't come about as\noften as I'd like, but when they do I know we'll be in great spirits, and laughter and love\nwill abound. I was sorry not to have been able to meet my cousin Claudia, currently on a\nprestigious assignment as an international arbitration judge in Paris, for dinner the last\nnight, along with Jill, but she understood that our plans had been completely upended by\nCovid. I hope to see her before long, on one side or another of the Atlantic!\nThings I ate: I insisted of having a few of my favorites: salmon tartare w/crispy frites; a\nrare entrec\u00f4te w/more frites; a yummy croque monsieur; a delicious \u00e9clair from Stohrer\nin the rue Montorgeuil made with exceptional chocolate; a sole chocolate from\nchocolatier Jacques G\u00e9nin; the chocolate mousse at Mensae (a study in contrasts: warm\nchocolate v. a hidden scoop of vanilla cream, smooth texture v. crunchy bits, black v.\nwhite etc.); a quartet of Eastern European lunch treats en plein air at chez Marianne, rue\ndes Rosiers (falafel balls, humus, baba ganoush, herring in mustard sauce); a perfectly\nripe crottin, delicious; delectably ripe, sweet strawberries; rosette de Lyon, tapenade\nwith figs, goose liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, a mi-cuit (molten chocolate cake); an excellent cr\u00eape\nw/rhubarb at Breizh Caf\u00e9 in the Marais. I missed out on a few faves: have to say I did not\ntaste an exceptional croissant (the ones in the hotel were frozen...), nor a superior\nbaguette sandwich, nor did I get to have my favorite pastry (tarte au citron), nor a\nmacaron (coffee or chocolate), did not register any truly exceptional wine and did not\nhave a truly 'aah' inspiring caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me doused in warm, creamy foam. But hey. I was still\nin foodie heaven.\nHotel: Very nice, in the 11e (my favorite arrondissement), small boutique hotel, H\u00f4tel Le\nMareuil. On a quiet street (rue de Malte). Closer to 'hipster' 11e (rue JP Timbaud) than to\nmy preferred 'bobo' 11e (rue Paul Bert, march\u00e9 d'Aligre). Well-situated, a close walk to\nthe upper Marais (rue de Turenne, rue de Bretagne, R\u00e9publique). Very helpful, bilingual\nstaff (although I was happy as a ....croissant to be jabbering away in French and\ndelighted to tap into that part of my cultural/linguistic identity); clean, Covid-safe (or so\nwe hoped?). I had a 'deluxe' room on the top floor, which of course, being Paris, was\nquite small but clean and comfortable, with a view over Parisian rooftops. Breakfast was\nadequate. Apparently there were some American style amenities like a gym, which I\ndidn't have time to check out. I do recommend.\nWhat I bought: My shopping appetite was whet, as was Jill's, and we enjoyed introducing\none another to some of our favorite shops. Practically on arrival, I headed straight to my\nfavorite jewelry store, La Tonkinoise in the rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, where Chantal\n                    \nManoukian, the most creative jeweler who upcycles vintage pieces found in flea markets\ninto all sorts of striking bracelets, earrings, barrettes etc., remembered me very well (I\nfollow her on Instagram and she knows I'm always in the market for dragonfly-themed\npieces). I bought a pretty bracelet featuring a kind of Art nouveau/Deco piece in silver. I\nalso took Jill along to my favorite clothing store, Anne-Elisabeth. Fairly slim pickings in\nthe sale basement, but I did buy a nice summer dress and two shirts. Also selected a\nnice smelling body lotion at Artisan Parfumeur in the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, where\nthe saleswoman was unnecessarily snooty, and was tempted by unique skirts in a pop-up\nstore in the same street. No time to go book shopping, unfortunately (although Vincent\nkindly gifted me three of his recent publications), and the rest of the items I bought were\neither food-related or gifts.\nOther visits: Beyond visiting with friends, walking (perhaps around 3-4 miles/day for me,\nnot bad considering my stamina is subject to off-kilter blood counts, effects of\nmedication etc.), caf\u00e9 sitting, sensual imbibing etc., I did make it, as planned, to La\nSamaritaine, an iconic 1869 Parisian department store located near the Pont-Neuf (1er),\nrecently subject to a vast, meticulous renovation to its former glory. The multitude of\npricey sales points in the store held no interest for me, but the architectural restoration\nwas fascinating -- a torrent of arabesques, peacock motifs, pastel yellows and blues,\nsteel and glass forming an ornate pre-Art nouveau shell. Delightful. Also had time for one\nexhibit, on Proust's Jewishness, at the MAHJ (quite interesting, yet I took issue\nw/comparisons of his editorial annotations on his manuscripts to midrash). Would have\nloved to have seen the Boldini exhibit at the Petit Palais. Might I be cautiously optimistic\nabout a 'next time?'\nA memorable morning at the Maison Vever: One of my week's highlights was visiting the\nshowroom of the recently relaunched Maison Vever, the fabled jewelry house to which\nI've devoted much of my research over the last fifteen years or so, founded by Henri and\nPaul Vever's grandfather in Metz in 1821. Camille and Damien Vever, the adult children\nof Doroth\u00e9e and Bruno Vever (Bruno being Paul's descendant, as Henri, the subject of\nmy research, left no direct descendants), are the brainchildren behind the relaunch, and\nthe showroom sits high above the rue de la Paix leading to the Op\u00e9ra and in view of the\nPlace Vend\u00f4me, a stone's throw from the original Maison Vever. The showroom is\nsublime (and subject to heavy security), the first jewelry lines, featuring gold, plique-\u00e0-\njour enamel, and lab grown diamonds both hearkening back to earlier pieces like Vever's\n_Sylvia_ pendant but with a modern sensibility, are gorgeous (gingkos!), and also on\ndisplay in the new Vever boutique at Le Printemps. I was delighted of course to see my\nbook, an edition of Vever's diary from 1898, on display, while the family was also kind\nenough to show me some original Vever pieces (including charming earrings Lalique\ncrafted for Henri Vever's daughter, Marguerite) in its possession. We casually discussed\npossible directions for future collaboration around art, commerce and research, as the\nVevers wish to penetrate the American market, and plan to visit New York before long to\nthis end.  After joining for group photos on the showroom's 7th floor terrace, I enjoyed a\n                    \nconvivial lunch with Bruno and Doroth\u00e9e Vever (who has been exceptionally kind and\nwell-disposed and supportive towards me over the past several years and whom I like a\nlot), our conversation ranging over French history (Louis XIV's policies!), Vever of course,\nmy treatment (briefly) and much else. After lunch, Bruno and Doroth\u00e9e desposited me at\nFoucher, another illustrious _chocolatier_ founded in 1819 in the avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra,\nwhen this area was the epicenter of Parisian luxury commerce and aristocratic tourism.\nDoroth\u00e9e had first taken me to Foucher a few years ago, and I bought some gifts for\nfriends.\nIt goes without saying that my relationship to Paris, and France in general, is like any\nmajor relationship that defines one's life, lest you think for a second that I'm simply a\nclich\u00e9-spouting Pollyannaish, garden-variety Francophile.  It's full of ups and downs, rifts\nand reunions, disappointments and pleasures, love and distaste. Anti-Semitism is\nabhorrent to me (as is all prejudice, of course), and I revile that part of France's history,\nhaving not only devoted much of my research to these questions but also having been\nprivy to banal, run of the mill (yet no less revelatory) anti-Jewish 'humor' (and worse) in\ncertain social situations in France. Bureaucratic inertia makes my skin crawl. But I\ndaresay this 'fraughtness' is just part of what has 'complexified' infinitely my relationship\nto France. The relationship is also a scrapbook of my life over the last (nearly) half-\ncentury. So many 'Willas' have sojourned there.  But what I've tried to capture here, in\nthis post and during this trip, is a more like a sensibility, a sense of well-being, at a\nparticular moment in time. Un 'feeling.'\nWas my rambling, cosmic, ruminative revisiting of my time(s) in France since 1975 worth\na night of insomnia last night? I have to believe it was. I caught a glimpse of my sixteen-\nyear-old self drinking cheap wine and flirting, with the rest of the summer study group in\nwhich I participated under the auspices of the Northfield Mount Herman School, at a little\nrestaurant in the Latin Quarter, called \"Le Bateau Ivre\" (_pace_ Rimbaud), then getting\nlost in the warren of streets around St. Michel with an American friend made on the trip,\nMargot, before somehow hopping onto a _bateau mouche_ at the last minute for an\nevening cruise around Paris with the rest of the group, which left me '\u00e9blouie' (I have a\njournal or a letter to my parents that recounts this evening but I can't find it right now).\nMore pictures to follow.\nHealth update: holding steady. Neck scan this Friday.\n \n.\n                    \nPhotos",

Sharon and I just arrived in Paris yesterday morning. It's my first time back\nsince fall 2019, which is my longest absence from the city since my grad school days. We\nlove being here seeing what has changed and what has remained the same. Last night,\nwe had dinner on our street at the Pure Caf\u00e9. We are still getting set up. Even though it's\nour apartment, there are always things that need to be fixed or taken care of that\nrequire attention as soon as we arrive. Sending you warm thoughts from the bobo-hood.\n  \u2014Richard Shryock, June 1, 2022  \n'Quelle joie de vivre' in a piece full of fascinating detail that took me straight back to the\nstreets of Paris. Willa, you could have had a second career as a travel writer....\n  \u2014Philip Mosley, June 1, 2022  \nSo glad you could relate, Phil, and that it brought back some good memories for\nyou too. I will never tire of writing about Paris, and most travel in general.\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, June 1, 2022  \nYou don't have to be a francophile (but I am) to appreciate your varied ectasies,\nthoughts and gratefulness!

It was a wonderful week, despite the rocky ending.\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, June 1, 2022  \nwhat a lovely recounting of a well-deserved trip to Paris! I think my smile got wider with\neach section. I am so happy you got to fit so much in during a relatively short time there.\n  \u2014Kory Olson, June 1, 2022  \n                    \nMerci, Kory! I know you can appreciate all of this. Didn't I run into you and Lorin in\nthe Marais on your first ever trip together there? I know you would have enjoyed\neverything we did, too (and would have added some early morning runs around Paris!).\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, June 1, 2022  \nAs an update, I had a great time Willa , and will travel with you anywhere\u2026 Sauf Covid.\nFor all your readers, everyone should know that I had very mild symptoms, with the\nworst being my worry that Willa would get sick. So glad you made it home when you did.\nEven though the trip was cut short, I was so happy to be a part of the adventure ,\nreconnect with you and see your Paris. While on my own, I did manage a little shopping\nand enjoy a few great meals. Willa, thank you for the lovely bio and kind words, You will\nhave to fill me in about Dr. Love, who was quite charming, and what a story we have to\ntell!

    "entry": "I haven't written in a while and I apologize. It's turned out to be a busy week, marked by\ntwo dissertation defenses since last Thursday, one in Art History the other in FFS (French\nand Francophone Studies). I had to move into high gear work-wise, a mode that has\nbecome less familiar to me since I retired (in terms of serving on committees etc.), and\nwas determined to bring my 'A game' to the defenses. This was especially true in the\ncase of this past Tuesday's defense, as the student defending, Morgane, is my advisee,\nwith whom I've worked closely over the past several years. As Morgane is in all likelihood\nmy last advisee, and as she's a particularly impressive younger scholar, I was committed\nto ensuring that all would go well (in terms of not only logistics for this zoom defense but\nalso the quality of the discussion, lines of questioning etc.). All went as planned: Morgane\npresented a fascinating project on unpublished life-writings from the Alsace-Lorraine\nborderland during the period when this region underwent multiple sovereignty changes\nand experienced two wars (1870, 1914-1918). The discussion with the committee (which\nincluded an outside member from the History department) was stimulating and rigorous,\nranging over questions of gender, Morgane's positioning in terms of the events and\nthemes she presented, material culture, future plans for this manuscript and more. The\ndiscussion and my reading of Morgane's dissertation actually made me give a lot of\nthought to my own practice as a diarist/blogger. I found after both defenses that I had\nreally been missing that level of discussion with colleagues and students, and felt good\nabout Morgane's work as well as that of the dozen or so other doctoral students I've\nhelped launch into academic positions during my time at Penn State (several have\nbecome close friends since). As happens often in these situations, it makes me reflect\nthat, had I stayed on for five more years or so at Penn State, I could have/would have\ndone more: more students advised, another book written (not out of the question,\nactually!), a Fulbright or other major grant scored, more extended stays in France,\ncollaborative work with international colleagues. \"I coulda been a contender.\" Oh well.\nIt's a regret, for sure, but knowing that I can't do anything about it I try not to let that\nrealization get me down.\nI drove up to campus after the defense - bearing champagne - for a lovely celebratory\nlunch in our conference room in Morgane's honor. She's off to take up a position as\nAssistant Prof. of French at High Point University in NC; her husband Aaron has a VAP\nposition at Wake Forest (VAP = Visiting Assistant Professor).\nI find that having discrete, manageable goals (such as preparing for two dissertation\ndefenses within a two-week period) is a helpful goal for me these days. It keeps me\ngrounded and structured, and helps prevent me from going into an emotional and/or\nexistential tailspin, consumed with questions about how I should be using my\n(remaining) time. My next goal is to finish off and submit a long article (to the journal\n_Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide_) on Vever's collaboration with the graphic artist\nEug\u00e8ne Grasset on twenty striking jewelry pieces displayed at the 1900 Paris World's\n                    \nFair. It doesn't need much more work. Then it will likely be back to editing Vever's 1899\ndiary; I'm pretty far along on that project as well. Colleagues at the Smithsonian and I\nare also working on Vever's 1891 travel diary to stops along the Silk Road after he\nparticipated in a trade show in Moscow, a fascinating document recording a trip that took\nVever and his wife all the way to Samarkand!\nAnyhoo, after last Thursday's defense in Art History, I found myself preparing a batch of\nrhubarb-strawberry compote, as I do so often (aside: some of you know about my long-\nstanding obsession with rhubarb - the color, the taste, the texture - resulting in a\ncascade of compotes, chutneys, cakes, etc. tumbling out of my kitchen and my drives to\nfarms where nice Amish farm ladies will go into their gardens and cut stalks of rhubarb\nfor me -- \"If I die young, bury me in a pile of rhubarb, lay me down on a bed of rhubarb,\nsink me in a river of rhubarb at dawn\" [!!!] -- Yes, it's to that point. I recall that my first\nencounter with rhubarb was in 1980, when my French 'mother,' eighty-year old Madame\nMarcelle Bloch, cooked rhubarb often. I remember that she always overcooked it and\nthat it was invariably stringy and of a grayish color, not that pleasing vibrant pink. I did\nenjoy the taste, though).\nIn any event, I was working (too) quickly and instead of slicing a piece of rhubarb, I sliced\nmy finger with a serrated knife, deeply, seemingly cutting into/off a chunk of it near my\nnail. It began to pulsate immediately and spurt blood (thank you, blood thinners). I ran\ninto the bathroom and tried to wash it, but that sent waves of additional pain shooting\nthrough my finger. By wrapping it in four bandaids applied extremely tightly, I was able\nto staunch the bleeding, and was then distracted for the rest of the evening by the\nbasketball game I watched  while lying on the couch. However, the throbbing pain was\nso intense that it woke me up several times during the night and essentially I wound up\nrenouncing sleep; I thought I had severed a nerve. At 6:00 a.m. I said to myself out loud:\n\"I need medical attention.\" I threw on some clothes and drove to the ER. Fortunately, it\nwas empty but I was assured that the Covid ER patients would begin to trickle in around\n7 a.m. The nice young doctor and then his older attending doctor took good care of me.\nWhen we removed the bandaids, the finger was still bleeding but the cut was not as bad\nas it could have been. The throbbing may have been made worse by my applying the\nbandaids so tightly. I also learned that long nerves run up the two sides of the finger. I\ndidn't need stitches nor 'skin glue' nor an X-ray. The doctors cleaned my wound\nthoroughly and wrapped it fairly loosely in sterile gauze. The finger's coming along well\nand I'm reminding myself not to rush when I'm cooking (and especially cutting).\nAccidents happen.\nI realize in retrospect that this was also a \"Jesus, take the wheel moment\" (wrong religion\nfor me, I know, but the image from the song fits). Sometimes I become completely\noverwhelmed by all I have to do to take care of myself: make, note and attend multiple\n                    \nappointments each week (labs, chemo, magnesium drip, scans etc.); advocate for myself\nwhen doctors who say they will call to discuss test results don't call; try to inform myself\nabout treatment options (I think I don't do a great job with this sometimes); arrange\nrides to/from some of my appointments (the ones during which I'll be zonked out on\nBenadryl; the others I can drive myself to); keep a running list of questions to ask my\nmedical team; pay medical bills; keep my house relatively in order, with help from a\nhouse cleaner (not always 100% reliable, but fine) and woman who helps me with\nerrands; prepare healthy meals for myself (I try to make one dish a week that will last for\n3-4 nights; this week it was turkey chili as I try to feature protein and veggies) etc. \"I\ncan't go on. You must go on. I'll go on.\" Sometimes I really want for someone(s) to take\ncare of me. And I would be negligent not to say that my wonderful circle of friends and\nfamily and neighbors do help immensely with that. And I'd also be negligent not to point\nout that my being 'alone' (a word I find distasteful and misleading in my case) is to a\nlarge extent my choice, as I often find it much *easier* and less cumbersome to do\nthings for myself than to have to involve another person in a 'caregiver' role, especially if\nthat person feels ambivalent about being in that role (of course, there are times, postop\nfor instance, when I truly need help, ask for it, and am only too happy to receive it). If\nyou know me well you know that I value my freedom above all (which of course is not to\nsay that I don't revel in my friendships and relationships, on the contrary), and have\npolitely declined at least one marriage proposal and two relationship proposals in recent\nyears, from guys who all went on to remarry, which is what they wanted (happy for\nthem!). Currently living in a completely existential (ie carpe diem, in this case) mode.\nWell, enough on that for today, shall we?\nOne night thoughts and questions about the final stages kept me up for a while: can I get\nhospice care at home here? How can I ensure a home death (which is what I want?). We\nare not there yet, though! So at one point in the ER, I remember saying to the two\ndoctors: \"Please just take care of me;\" I think this ER visit may have represented my\nacting out this scenario (of wanting to be cared for) in some way but it's hard to tell. I'm\nnot saying I cut myself *in order to get attention,* but once in the ER it felt so good to be\nattended to by the nice physicians. The young one kept going on and on about how\nmuch he loves rhubarb (wish I could have given him some!), while the older one simply\nsaid, before exiting my room: \"When you look at your finger, which will likely bear a scar,\nyou'll always think of rhubarb compote.\"\nThe rest of that morning was pretty crazy. I had a neck scan at 9:50 at the same hospital\nin whose ER I found myself at about 8 or so. Should I simply sit in my car until my next\nappointment, perhaps crawl into the back seat and doze? In the end, I decided to drive\nhome (about 20 mn.), crawl into my bed, and sleep for about half an hour. Then I was\nback up and driving to the hospital for the second time, for the scan. Sitting in the dingy\nwaiting area outside the CT-scan room, I was treated to the sounds of the elderly patient\nin the queue before me screaming her head off while undergoing her scan. My own scan\nonly took about five minutes (I honestly think I fell asleep in the machine). My next\n                    \nappointment was for lunch at 12:30 and at this point it might have been 11:00? So I\ndrove home once again, crawled into my bed once again, and slept for about half an\nhour before lunch with my friend Sandy. Lunch outdoors in the sun at Duffy's Tavern in\nBoalsburg was lovely despite my fatigue, and I told Sandy that I was very happy to have\nmy day officially 'begin' with lunch, burying the stressful, unpleasant morning. Oh well!\nWhen I told Sandy about the title I was mulling for this entry (\"It all began with a stalk of\nrhubarb\"), she reminded me of the first line of Ann Patchett's novel, _Commonwealth_:\n\"The christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with gin.\" Great first line\nand I love Ann Patchett.\nSpeaking of risky behavior (cf slicing my finger as if it were a stalk of rhubarb), I found\nmyself binge eating for a few days. In writing this, I do not know whether I seek\nchastising, compassion, sympathy/empathy or something else. I'm a bit surprised I'm\neven choosing to write about a 'secret behavior.' I think it's a bit like the \"Jesus, take the\nwheel\" moments I experience sometimes; I become unregulated, and I don't care. I need\nthat kind of release and testing of limits. I found myself eating somewhat insatiably and\nuncontrollably for a few days, even veering into some unhealthy and caloric foods that I\ndon't normally eat: a tuna sub from Subway (Subway! tuna, though, is the only sub I'll\neat from that place, and about once a year; I can't stomach processed sandwich meat), a\nrefreshing yet highly caloric and sugary lemonade from Wegmans' (ok, freshly\nsqueezed...); a bunch of sweets and treats from the Cake Shop by Tati, eaten in\nsuccession (a croissant, chocolate chip cookie, and a carrot-coconut muffin that I had\ntold myself I'd save for the following day but in the end did not), a big bag of popcorn\n(things with kernels are generally not good for me), some random candy from Trader\nJoe's, an entire jar of pickles that I drove twelve miles to buy from a specialty store in\nBellefonte (Belle Mercantile) and then wolfed down in my car, savoring the salty, sour,\ndill-infused brine and crunchy pickles. I think I'm back 'on the wagon' now and certainly\nrecognizable (yes?...) as a relatively slender person, but the temptation to cram my face\nwith copious amounts of food is still there. I think this binging also served the purpose of\ngiving me a little 'belly,' which I could subsequently blame for/confound with any\npotential stomach bloating indicating new or recurrent cancer. In other words, I may be\ntrying to 'mask' a potentially distressing result. Further, Dr. Beavis' account (at my\nrequest) of the final stages entailing losing the desire/ability to eat has me, I believe,\n'hoarding' food as a kind of buffer and trying to ward off this eventuality as a squirrel\nmight stock up on acorns in view of the 'lean periods' (magical thinking?). And of course,\nI do love to eat, cook etc. But in all realms I need to try to stick to 'behavior I can\nsanction' (a phrase my therapist and I bandy about). But oh gosh, it's really hard\nsometimes....\nBoth my MRI and neck CT indicate no recurrence. I had both Dr. Patel jeune and Dr.\nBettegowda at Hopkins look at the imaging, and spoke to the Dr. Patel's PA on the\nphone. This of course if very good news but in all honesty I'm much more nervous about\nmy pelvic/abdominal/chest scan next Tuesday. I've been having weekly magnesium drips\n                    \n(two hours) because that electrolyte level is low. Otherwise, my blood counts have been\nok enough for chemo to proceed every week (as it did today). My CA 125 (cancer\nantigen) level today is 13.9, well under the 38 U/ml limit considered normal. However,\nafter being told for months (years?) that this level is all important, Dr. Beavis more\nrecently told me that my current treatment somehow 'falsifies' this level, making it a less\nsignificant indicator (well then, why do they even order this test? I need more clarity on\nthis) and to Dr. Patel, \"it's just a number.\" What to make of it? I don't know. I will soon\nknow whether my treatment will change with the possible addition of Avastin to help the\nTaxol work better. In my mind, Avastin is \"the drug that's going to kill me\" because of\nthe very small risk of a bowel perforation (in which case, per Dr. Beavis, it's \"game\nover\"). I see we may be playing Russian roulette soon. Per Dr. Patel the elder, in an\nominous tone that annoyed me: \"There will be findings\" (from the CT-scan). When I\nasked him how he knew that, he replied that it's simply a matter of the natural\nprogression of the disease. I wish his tone had not been so foreboding. Of course it's\nscary. I need a lunch (and will have one soon) with my local friend Deb, a fourteen-year\nsurvivor who's undergone treatment all along. I've been reading in the NYTimes about\nsome promising new treatments for breast and rectal cancer. Wouldn't it be great if\n'they' discovered some sort of 'magic bullet' for ovarian cancer?... I may not live to see it,\nbut hopefully it will happen one day. And through all of this, in the end, I am not feeling\ntoo badly! My days are full; I do need to exercise more, but each day brings drives to\nseveral farmers markets, cooking, some work, reading, getting together and/or\ncorresponding with friends...\nBen is coming home for a week on Monday. I can't wait to see him! And my cousin Julie\nwill be visiting from Florida later this month! Have already made turkey chili and will\nmake, this weekend, garlic scape pesto, asparagus soup, and a rhubarb-strawberry crisp.\nNo sliced fingers, promise!\n \nPhotos",

    "date": "June 19, 2022",
    "entry": "When I finally summoned the courage to read the Geisinger radiologist's report on my\npelvic/chest/abdominal CT, on Thursday I believe, my mind immediately translated the\nfirst line - \"Progression of disease\" - into \"I am going to die.\" I ran into my bedroom to\nbegin frantically labelling and separating into ziploc bags all my heirloom jewelry to give\nto Ben and other family members, laying these heirlooms into an extra jewelry box I had\nbought for this purpose. I now understand that I was having at least in part a\nphysiological response to reading the report; fortunately, a number of relatives and\nfriends whose highly functioning prefrontal cortexes served to moderate my\nimpulsiveness and heightened 'fight or flight' responses, urged me to take a proverbial\nbreath and await further input from my medical team.\nWhich I did, both from Dr. Patel when I met with him on Friday and from Dr. Beavis via\nemail. Not unexpectedly (and I had said this to a few friends even before the fact),\nseveral lymph nodes in my abdomen have grown in size, indicating likely presence of\ncancer within. I could see them clearly and thickly on the image Dr. Patel showed me,\nand they sometimes cause me some discomfort (unless I'm misidentifying the symptom).\nThere also seems to have been growth of cancerous tissue mass in my abdomen, also\nnot a surprise.\nThe problem is that we appear to be running out of viable treatment options. Dr. Beavis\ntold me this would likely be the case. I've been through about five or six lines of\ntreatment already; after a while, they are no longer effective. My current treatment,\nweekly Taxol, appears to be helping in some ways -- tumors on the vagina, Dr. Beavis\nnoted, have actually shrunk in size! -- but not in others: several abdominal lymph nodes,\nwhich of course can carry cancer to other parts of the body, are enlarging. Unless a\npromising clinical trial can be identified for me at a place that makes sense for me to be\ntreated - Memorial Sloan Kettering, for example -- the next step is likely Taxol + Avastin,\na new drug for me. Avastin, Dr. Patel explained to me, helps Taxol work better as it\ninhibits the cancer cells from creating their own, autonomous blood supplies that they\ncan draw on (yes, this disease is insidious, as Dr. Beavis has said; thanks, guys [or gals]\nfor not only setting up camp in my body but developing your own blood supply to\nboot...). Tracy, one of the nice chemo nurses, told me that most patients tolerate Avastin\nwell. There is a risk of elevated blood pressure, some issue with a protein (my urine will\nbe checked every time), and of course that small risk of bowel perforation that could\nmean for me, in Dr. Beavis' words, 'game over;' Dr. Patel, though, as well as the nurse I\nspoke with, could really not recall this ever having been an issue with any of his patients,\nthough. A very scary prospect, nevertheless, and surely a 'leap of faith' will now be\nrequired on my part, the relative riskiness of the treatment being the measure of the\nstage we're at with it...\nAs for clinical trials, it is not certain this will be a viable option. I need to consult\n                    \nclinicaltrials.gov again and see if anything looks promising or applicable there. I may\nsimply try to get a consult at MSK if possible. I may need Dr. Beavis' help getting my foot\nin the door but I'll also try myself, probably tomorrow; time to do the work, think clearly,\nadvocate for myself, assure myself I'm exhausting all reasonable treatment options. For\nsome trials, one has to have been free of brain mets for a certain length of time; my\nbrain has been mets-free for (only?) five months. Yes, cancer research is ongoing and\nnew treatments are coming available; but will there be one suited to my case/stage, and\nwill I be able to access it? Not clear yet - at all. At this point, I would not feel comfortable\ntravelling any further afield than places within striking range, close to friends and family\n(Philly I suppose, Pittsburgh, Hopkins but I'm not seeing any trials going on there, DC,\nMSK/NYC). Is this the right decision?\nWhen I was with Dr. Patel, he looked at my imaging, sighed slightly (or was I imagining\nthis?) and said: \"Well, the good news is that your brain imaging looks clear.\" Incidentally,\nso do my chest and my liver, an organ I was concerned about. Actually, my liver looks a\nlittle 'wonky;' one lobe is atrophied, another hypertrophied, several cysts, although not\ncancerous, sit on its surface. To my relief, Dr. Patel explained that a liver can look like\nthis (is 'asymmetrical') when one lobe is working harder than the other. Dr. Beavis had\nasked that Dr. Patel call her to discuss the options, which Dr. Patel did, immediately after\nI spoke with him; he then stopped by the infusion room a bit later to update me on the\nemerging plan. Another brief exchange with Dr. Patel - everything happened quickly, and\nboth doctors are so busy - had me confirming that I wanted to continue with treatment.\nMy reading of our quickly exchanged words was that this could be a point at which some\npatients might choose to stop treatment, for any number of reasons. I told him with no\nhesitation that I wished to continue; I feel strong enough and am certainly not ready to\nstop. At what point I will wish to, though, is unclear. I will want to see how the new drug\ncombo works, if no clinical trial is available. Our goal is to maintain stability of the lymph\nnodes or to have them shrink in size. I'll need further scans after a while. And I will make\nsure all other viable options have been exhausted. I raised the possibility of further\nradiation, surgery, which Dr. Patel dismissed (too invasive, I suppose, but need to find\nout more).\nThe upshot of these fairly compressed discussions, on Friday, was that I did not yet start\nthe new chemo combo (I'm ok with this; I need to find out more, and it all seemed quite\nrushed although again, not unexpected). Instead, I had my now habitual weekly\nmagnesium drip. This is another point of some concern, I suppose. I am having trouble\nkeeping my magnesium level up, although the chemo nurse tells me I'm not at a 'critical'\npoint. This electrolyte regulates many important biochemical functions, including those\nrelated to the heart. Dr. Patel's first hypothesis was that I was losing magnesium\nbecause of diarrhea, but now he wonders whether I am 'leaking' it from somewhere\n(kidneys?). Another point of worry is a brown spot the dermatologist removed from\nbelow my eyelid on Friday during a routine appointment (it's a new dermatologist as my\nprevious one left town; we had been watching this spot develop but to be honest with\n                    \nmy focus on my other cancers I did not even stop to think that maybe a melanoma would\nget me in the end!!). Calling it an 'ugly duckling' because of its shape, Dr. Van Ness\n(whom I liked) said that she was \"concerned\" and sent it off to be biopsied. We simply\nagreed that should it turn out to be cancerous, we'll \"deal with it.\" Because that's what\nwe do.\nThrough all of this, I'm (still) not feeling too bad. My energy level is ok, I've been able to\ntake walks (1 mile?) and much longer drives that allow me to gain clarity and focus on\nnature and the beautiful countryside. Lots and lots of time to think. Today I crossed\ndozens of buggies filled with Amish in their Sunday best, rolling along Paradise Drive; a\ngroup of about ten girls returning from worship in crisp blue dresses, white bonnets and\nwhite aprons crossed my path and we waved hello. For some reason, the scene\nreminded me of some of Gauguin's paintings of pardons in Brittany. I am aware of my\nidealizing and likely somewhat voyeuristic fascination with this culture, but there is\nsomething in its simplicity that grounds me.\nAnd doing lots of cooking, buying produce right off the farms. Strawberry-rhubarb crisp,\nrhubarb chutney, cherry clafoutis, cream of asparagus soup, garlic scape pesto, parsley-\nfeta salad dressing, a tofu dish in green curry glaze. Still binge-eating a little bit, feeling\nlike I want to 'ingest' life to the fullest. And therefore not sleeping all that much; my mind\nis often racing. I'm determined to 'ingest' glorious June as entirely and joyfully as I can:\nbring on the farm stands, the nurseries, the beautiful light flickering and filtering through\nmy blinds at about 6 p.m., the lunches outdoors with friends.\nSo yes, meanwhile, there is the business of living to attend to. I spent Saturday morning\nin shul, at the bar-mitzvah of a friend's son. It was lovely, as always, to enjoy the\nfellowship of a few congregants I hadn't seen in a while. Everyone kept telling me how\ngood I look, and I generally can't deny that! But I tend to have mixed feelings about the\ncomment; it can even make me feel angry, as if people are not 'getting it.' Part of me\nfeels as if I don't want to deceive, understanding that one can look great or at least\n'normal,' and still be quite sick (Dr. Beavis and my own experience with others have\nconfirmed this point).\nAlthough there's undeniably great wisdom to be found in each of the Torah's portions,\nthe one the bar-mitzvah explicated, about a first Passover the Israelites celebrated in the\ndesert (before the more familiar Passover story), did not capture my attention. But\nthere's usually some verse of image in the prayer book that does. This time, it was a\nbeautifully-worded passage (which I wish I could recall verbatim) about the burning bush\nand ordinary miracles in our midst. Granted, the bush that burned without being\nconsumed by fire was perhaps no 'ordinary miracle,' but an extraordinary, supernatural\noccurrence. However, it made me think about the 'ordinary miracles' taking place right in\nfront of my eyes, the work of ordinary angels in my midst. The friend who texts: \"I am\nwith you always.\" A second friend who texts: \"Free to take a walk tomorrow?\" A third\n                    \nfriend, a marvelous cook, who offers to shop, cook, clean for a dinner party for me, for\nwhich I need only supply a guest list. Another friend who brings me goodies that she\nknows I will love - a chocolate babka from Breads Bakery, cheeses from Zabar's -- from\nNew York; my dear son, a wonderful comfort and a sensitive, helpful and fun companion\nall week, who offers to come over from his dad's one evening just so I won't have to\nwatch the NBA finals match by myself. I'll miss him but hope to get to the city before\nlong. I am grateful. \nPhotos",

    "entry": "It's been a somewhat uncanny, odd-seeming time -- time \"out of joint.\" Following my\nmost recent CT-scan, I spoke with both Dr. Beavis (by phone) and Dr. Patel, in the office.\nFrom Dr. Beavis: \"We still have options.\" However, I detected a discernable and\npurposeful (yet not vocalized) 'BUT' in her voice after that phrase. There are options...\nbut these are her so-called 'back-pocket options,' in extremis options (eg\nimmunotherapy-related options, which have *not* been shown to work effectively on\novarian cancer), options that entail significant risk. Unless a promising clinical trial was\nto be found quickly, Dr. Beavis indeed recommended (and Dr. Patel concurred) the\ncombo of Taxol + Avastin, the new drug that would be added. As I've mentioned several\ntimes, Avastin comports a 5% risk of bowel perforation, which could be deadly. Dr. Patel,\nthough, as I've also mentioned, has never (or hardly ever) encountered this scenario with\na patient. So I will live with some trepidation. And did I mention that my new combo of\nTaxol + Avastin has a *15%* success rate of stabilizing the lymph nodes or reducing\nthem in size? Well, perhaps I'll be one of the lucky 15 of 100 who benefit from this\ntreatment; I suppose I have other positives going for me (for example, not having any\nother major health condition such as high blood pressure, heart issues etc.). The decision\nto go with Taxol + Avastin was made pretty quickly, and in the few days that intervened\nbefore I began that treatment last Friday (so far, so good, no marked ill effects; I'll be\nscanned after about eight infusions) no viable clinical trials had been identified at\nHopkins nor at M.D. Anderson (or rather in the state of Texas), where my oncologist\ncollege classmate/guardian angel Dr. Steven Sherman practices. \nIn a late-breaking development today, though, I finally succeeded in scheduling a consult\n                    \nwith a gyn-onc at Memorial Sloan Kettering for July 18th! I am feeling pretty jazzed about\nthis, because until now it's proved near-impossible for me to get into MSK. They don't\nreally like you to be in treatment when they see you (in case they have something else\nto propose), but of course I really had to start my current treatment because I need it! So\non Dr. Beavis' advice, I very slightly 'fudged' what I imparted to MSK about my current\ntreatment, without veering into untruths, because I am feeling fairly desperate for them\nto see me. This appointment is giving me some hope.\nIn another late-breaking development, my friend Steve (the one who originally got me\nsquared away with the team at Hopkins, for which I am eternally grateful) offered --\nwhen I contacted him recently -- to share a summary of my treatment info with the same\ncolleagues of his who suggested Hopkins originally to see if they might know of any\npromising clinical trials for me. The website clinicaltrials.gov, on which all clinical trials\nmust register, is not user friendly and contains quite technical descriptions of trials,\nconfusing for laypeople. I am hoping that Steve's colleagues can help me parse it and\npoint me in the right direction, if possible. I would consider going further afield than my\ngeographical comfort zone (NY/Philly/Pittsburgh/DC/Baltimore) for treatment but it would\ndepend on what is available -- if anything at this time.\nI am not sure if there's anything else I need to be doing/pursuing right now. I am unsure\nwhether I should make some appointments, for example, at other major comprehensive\ncancer centers to see what might be out there.\nDr. Beavis' comment during one of our late-night conversations when I was in the\nhospital at Hopkins -- about her belief that each person should have the death they\ndesire -- has somehow recently functioned as a light switch for me. I broke through some\ninertia (and fear? and anxiety?) and began to jot down notes about my wishes for my\nfuneral and burial, possessions, charitable contributions I wish to make etc. Dare I say\nthat it felt empowering and liberating? And being the 'creative,' the extrovert, and the\nplanner I am, in a very strange way I felt I was sinking my teeth (sorry for mixed\nmetaphor) into this 'project,' thinking through the myriad details much like I would those\nof a dinner party, or a wedding, or a bar-mitzvah. Except I won't be there -- how odd --\nunless I opt for something like a living funeral, which is not outside the realm of\npossibility.\nI'm choosing to embrace death positivity. This does not mean feeling 'positive' about the\nthe prospect of dying. As a joy-bringer, life-affirmer, highly affiliative soul, and party girl,\ngetting up close and personal with my mortality all the time right now pretty much\nSUCKS big time. So please let's refrain from showering me with \"At leasts\" for now like\nsome sort of consolation prize in this awful game, shall we? (\"At least you have time to\nsay your goodbyes with sufficient time\"). Death positivity means a)striving to have the\ndeath I desire and b)bringing death into conversations all of us should be having\nthroughout our lives (and I should have started much earlier), not cordoning it off from\n                    \nlife like the...Black Plague.\nI do admit the possibility, though, that my death positive attitude may contain some part\nof denial. Major freakouts are likely somewhere on the horizon for me. At the same time,\nthough, I feel empowered, in control. At least for now.\nOf course, I have no idea how long I may live. A rogue cancer cell could metastasize to\nany part of my body at any time, and I could start not to feel well quickly. Conversely,\nthe MSK consult and/or *possible* clinical trial could help prolong my life. I could be\ngiven two years (as Dr. Beavis has done) and live twice that. Or something critical could\nemerge, and things could accelerate. So when to have these conversations? And how?\nAnd with whom? And to what extent? Because meanwhile the crucial business of living\ncontinues, and I am committed to it. Who do I want to hold close in the inner circle? Who\nto keep in different kinds of roles? There is no road map. It can be confusing,\noverwhelming. And I need to take care of myself. So I may lean more heavily on instinct\nthan I usually do. Instinct often serves me well. \nBtw, \u00e0 propos of nothing but fwiw: I don't believe in an afterlife. I will not be reunited\nwith my loved ones in any type of space of place in the future. I ascribe pretty fully to\nJewish beliefs about the end being the end. Dispose of the body quickly (I desire a green\nburial but there are no green cemeteries in State College, a dilemma), sit shiva, and\nmove on with the business of living. But I also ascribe to the lines we read in the\nKaddish: \"[The Dead] still live on earth in the acts of goodness they performed, and in\nthe hearts of those who cherish their memory.\" Life after death continues in perpetuity,\nbut it will be memory- and affect-based. It will be different. What a strange thought.\nI'll meet with my financial advisor and lawyer soon and deal with some of the nuts and\nbolts of fine-tuning. And plan to have some of those Hard Conversations. But I'm leaving\nplenty of time for buoying myself too -- dinners and lunches with friends, visits, drives,\ncooking, reading, writing, outings, little trips, tending to my pretty front garden patch. In\nan impulse buy yesterday, I scooped up some lavender incense cones and two small\nincense burners, like those I used to love in middle and high school growing up near the\nVillage in the hippie-dippy late 60s -- and which remind me of my younger self -- tokens\nof comfort.\nThere may be a part II coming with thoughts I've forgotten to include, devastated\nfeelings about the repeal of Roe and the current and future state of the country in\ngeneral,  plus an account of my fun weekend with Julie, my OG ride or die\npal/sister/cousin, who flew up from Florida to spend the weekend with me. For now,\ndinner time: some tofu with peppers and some sort of marinade, perhaps?",

    "entry": "Pretty much status quo on the health front. Looking ahead to my consult at Sloan on\n7/18; a few friends who are physicians or in biotech are also trying to help me identify\nviable clinical trials. I've connected with a physician who is a 'clinical trials navigator' at\nM.D. Anderson, thanks to Steve Sherman, but we have not actually spoken yet. She left a\nvery nice voicemail and I'll call her again after the weekend and forge ahead with\ninformation-gathering. Chemo on Friday was unremarkable; I had forgotten that I'm only\nreceiving the additional boost of Avastin every other time so was infused with just Taxol\non Friday. My magnesium level increased a bit so only one extra infusion next week, not\nthree. And the suspicious spot under my eye that was biopsied turned out not to be\ncancerous. I'll see my PCP on Tuesday for a routine appointment. My friend Zia has put\nholistic-type treatments, and especially juicing, firmly on my radar screen (thanks, Z),\nsomething I probably should have considered earlier on. I plan to buy a juicer and\nexperiment with all manner of greens, berries, ginger, turmeric, natural sweeteners etc.\nFeel free to send along your favorite juice recipes! Meanwhile, my appetite still feels\nvoracious, perhaps attributable to the steroid I'm taking for lingering skull discomfort;\nbetter than losing my appetite, I suppose. Not feeling badly overall.\nI did not lack for energy during my cousin Julie's recent long weekend visit from Florida.\nWe had a wonderful, relaxing, fun get-together, tailored to our current incarnations as\n63-year-old moms to sons (as well as older sisters to younger brothers, and daughters to\ntwo sisters, my aunt and mother). This meant, for example, late afternoon rests, a far cry\nfrom our marathon weekends growing up, exchanging visits from our homes in the city\nand in nearby Fairfield County, CT (we'd meet under the big clock in Grand Central\nStation); our hard partying college days, when once again we commuted between\nCambridge, MA and Amherst, MA, for unforgettable adventures; a high-intensity\ninterlude in Paris and southern France, where my passport was stolen and yet I somehow\nwas permitted, in these pre-September 11, 2001 days, to cross the border into Italy by\ntrain without papers after a distraught leave-taking from my cousin, who was heading\nback to the U.S.; and the several trips we took to see each other as married moms living\nin PA and FL. The marriages ended (as did our mothers'), the baby boys have grown up,\nbut our lifelong bond endures.\nSaturday took us to an arts festival in Milheim, and included lunch at Elk Creek Cafe,\nantiquing, and a drive in the country, while Sunday we headed to Bellefonte for more\nantiquing, admiring the well-kept Victorian mansions and strolling in pretty Talleyrand\nPark. Dinner (duck!) at Central Reservation one night; the other evenings we cooked.\nConvos often referring back to events of decades ago (and therefore requiring almost a\ntype of shorthand) mingled with musings on our current states, nostalgia working its way\n                    \ninto some of those Hard Conversations -- thank you, Julie, for your loyalty, love and care,\nand for the several important promises you made me without hesitation. \nA practice suggested in _The Book of Joy_ (conversations between the Dalai Lama and\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu), involving identifying three sources of gratitude daily, has not\nproven difficult for me at all! I am grateful to my dear friends Jim D. for having gifted me\nthis book, which turned out to be exactly the book I needed to read right now; to Helen,\nfor a carton of fresh eggs delivered to my doorstep; to Cheryl, for thinking of me during\nwhat I'm sure was a packed trip to Santa Fe, returning with a pair of gorgeous blue\nturquoise slab earrings for me (which I found tucked into one of my flower pots outside\nmy front door, along with a card bearing a meaningful Navajo quote about 'walking in\nstrength' and 'walking in beauty'); to Kathryn and John, for a box of delectable black\nraspberries from the Amish (I much enjoyed our lunch at Voodoo Lounge the other day,\noverlooking a tranquil gurgling creek); to my neighbor Pat, for baking me blueberry\nmuffins to enjoy with my iced coffee, delivered when she and her husband Dennis picked\nme up from chemo on Friday; to Isa, for sending me kitchen gloves to ensure that I avoid\nany trips to the ER in the future when/if my knife slips; to John O., for offering to cater a\ndinner party for me with his phenomenal cooking! If I haven't mentioned you here,\nplease know that I'm grateful for many other acts of kindness (texts, emails, calls etc.).\nAnother practice suggested by _The Book of Joy,_ with which I was already familiar\nthanks to my friend Shanny, is daily intention-setting. Recently, I set as my intention to\nrevel in the month of June, particularly glorious this year. This meant, of course, lots of\ndrives down backroads, enjoying gorgeous vistas, cooking with the bountiful early\nsummer produce, greenhouses and farm stands (I can't stop buying planters! My front\npatio looks like a lush floral paradise, albeit a bit over the top...). Today I drove further\nafield, about thirty miles away towards Lock Haven, to Sugar Valley/Loganton -- buggies,\na greenhouse, and an enchanting 1874 covered bridge, the last covered bridge, in fact,\nin Clinton County. Last night was dinner outdoors on my back patio with my friend\nAndrew: I made an heirloom tomato salad with ricotta and a good vinaigrette + a cherry\nand black raspberry clafoutis for dessert, while he supplied his fabulous Negronis\n(Stanley Tucci recipe; twice the gin!), of which I drank a few thimblefuls, ie small cordial\nglasses. Lovely evening, great convo. I try to stay in the moment and focus on all the\npleasure this brings...\n_Why I don't care for the 'fighting' or 'battling' metaphor:_ Yes, a non-seq here, but it's\nbeen on my mind. A lot has been written on this by others than me, but I'm aware that\ninjunctions to 'keep fighting' etc. irk me. It seems to me that I'm simply doing what the\ngreat majority of people would do should they desire to live. 'Fighting on' seems to me to\nbelong to a narrative we craft of control over disease, whereas ovarian cancer is nothing\nif not insidious. I can attempt to have agency over 'winning' or 'losing' to the extent\npossible, but at least some of it is completely out of my control. Moreover, 'battling' my\ndisease also means not only willing chemotherapy to kill off 'bad' cancer cells but also\naccepting that the chemo is killing or damaging many of my healthy cells as well, a\n                    \nstrange 'battle' indeed. I may be able to frame this more coherently going forward, and\nfor now I really can't say what type of injunction would motivate (or irk) me more than\nthe 'fighting' clich\u00e9. Perhaps simply meeting me and 'holding space' for me wherever I\nhappen to land at a given moment is the most helpful thing  you can do.\nEnjoy the holiday weekend. I have such mixed feelings contemplating our flag. It's\nbecome such a deeply divisive, multiple signifier. The local backroads are bedecked with\nthem, often paired with a \"Don't Tread on Me\" or occasional Confederate flag. In this\ncontext, it's a symbol that, sadly, almost repels me, whereas it used to make me proud.\nFor today, I'll simply focus on all the goodness that has been manifesting itself to me\nrecently. I believe in the goodness in you.\n[For some reason, my images are not uploading correctly. I will try again to add them\nlater].",

It connotes anger, nastiness, and a lot\nof other words. Staying positive, enjoying each day for what it brings, and thankfulness\nto see another day is enough. Public awareness is such an important thing. A now\nfamous cancer patient here in England died the other day at age 40. She made the\npublic aware of bowel cancer symptoms and the numbers Googling jumped from 2,000\none day to 23,000 the day after she died.\n  \u2014June Pickering, July 3, 2022  \nI agree with you, June. And I did read quite a bit about the cancer patient you\n                    \nmention (can't recall her name) and her campaign to bring awareness to bowel cancer.\nThis is very important. It seems like the focus on efforts like these is more meaningful\nthan discourse about 'the fight.'\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, July 3, 2022  \nYour appreciation of \"The Book of Joy\" sent me to Google excerpts. \"Hope,\" which\ncharacterizes you, brings inner strength, self-confidence, the ability to do what you do\nhonestly, truthfully and transparently.\" I would add generosity, the hallmark of your\nCaringBridge! XOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, July 3, 2022  \nWilla, re: \"fighting\": I wonder what you might think instead about metaphors of surfing or\nsailing, with control over rough seas only ever provisional or illusory. In this connection, I\ncan't help thinking of Victor Hugo's marine drawings, particularly \"Ma Destin\u00e9e,\" so\nevocative of the ocean's awesome power (BTW, it's apparently now available for\npurchase, emblazoned on a tote bag: https://www.redbubble.com/i/tote-bag/Victor-Hugo-\nMy-destiny-Ma-destin%C3%A9e-The-Wave-La-Vague-by-\nArtExpression/41491756.A9G4R).\n  \u2014Michael Garval, July 3, 2022  \nWhat an apt image, Mike.

Thank you, Janis, for driving me to chemo as usual and to Greg\nM. for picking me up, treating me to an iced cappuccino and scone at Caf\u00e9 Lemont, and\nbringing me home (even while planning your own trip to Boston for your father's funeral),\nwhere I conked out on the couch for a while. Three-month check-in this past week with\nmy primary care physician, Dr. Damaske. He tweaked some of my meds (upped my\nLexapro dosage; stressed taking high Tylenol dosage and antacids for sometimes bad\nindigestion and abdominal discomfort), examined me (said he did not feel any\nprotuberances near surface; cancerous lymph nodes must be buried further under\nsurface); let me know how to alert myself to a bowel perforation, a constant source of\nstress for me (basically, I'd experience sepsis>high fever and chills and abdominal pain,\nwarranting immediate attention in the ER). He's a kind, compassionate young(ish) doc,\n                    \nwho (I learned, from the rainbow striped heart pin he was wearing) treats many young\ntrans patients locally. Highly empathic, he asked if he could give me a hug, which he did,\nand I asked if I could call him Paul, which I also did (he calls me Willa on my insistence,\nno longer \"Dr. Silverman\"). Grateful to have him on my care team (and to have his\npersonal cell phone # at my fingertips if needed).\nI am also in an information gathering phase regarding clinical trials and other treatment\noptions. I eagerly await my consultation with gyn-onc Dr. Seth Cohen at Sloan-Kettering\non July 18th. I am very curious to know whether MSK might have something to offer me\nthat might prolong my life  -- targeted therapy, immunotherapy, clinical trial etc. -- no\nguarantee, of course. I have also spoken twice by phone to a 'clinical trials navigator' at\nM.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, a kindly and helpful physician, Liliana Milojevic\n(many thanks to my college classmate/guardian angel Dr. Steven Sherman for making\nthe contact). Dr. Milojevic gave me her opinion on a few trials that had been identified\nfor me by other contacts (Maria's physician son; Ben's friends Nikhil and Irene, who work\nin biotech/biological research). While as Dr. M. noted it can be hard to assess these\naforementioned trials as they are *trials* (ie in the process of being tested), she seemed\nto me to express some doubts about their viability (some would require much further\nadvance testing on me before I could even be considered for the trial, for example).\nRather, she sent me information about a number of trials going on at M.D. Anderson that\n*might* be useful for me. *If* I were to be accepted into them (and we are *many* steps\nfrom that point), I would need to go to Houston for treatment (and initial consult before\nthat), and possibly set myself up there for a while. I will also run the descriptions of these\ntrials by Dr. Beavis, who suggested that there appear to be no viable trials for me taking\nplace at Hopkins right now. I will query Dr. Patel too, but as a generalist medical\noncologist he is not likely to be up to date on the latest/best gyn-onc trials. And I'll likely\nfollow up with Steve Sherman as well. SO: information-gathering at least through my\nSloan consult, then assessing followed by Big Decision making. This keeps me up at\nnight (more or less every other night), but I'm also trying to proceed methodically and\nmake the best decisions for myself. Hope I am... Meanwhile, thank goodness, still feeling\nok, out and about, energy level acceptable, doing my stuff, seeing friends, finishing off\nan article, cooking, taking drives, looking forward to my mother's visit next week during\nArts Fest and then returning with her to NY for a few days (will stay in Ben's apartment in\nPark Slope after consult!). Amen.\nEvery day a blessing. Every minute, actually.\nOver the holiday weekend (which was quiet and perfectly pleasant for me), I read Delia\nEphron's memoir, _Left on 10th: A Second Chance at Life, A Memoir,_ which (like Suleika\nJouad's _Between Two Kingdoms_ but in a most different style) recounts the writer's\ngrueling treatment (in a clinical trial) for leukemia and her *recovery* from this\nseemingly near-fatal treatment, the \"poison cure.\" I should likely be struck down for\noccasional pangs of envy towards the author, who's in her seventies: she has means and\n                    \nname-recognition (and thus access to superior treatment, rooms etc.) and a remarkable\ncarer and adored second husband, a psychiatrist and widower named Peter Rutter, who\nreached out to her after she had written a piece in the _NYTimes_ shortly after her own\nhusband had passed (a well-known writer, she is also the sister of the late Nora Ephron,\nwho died of leukemia) (http://www.deliaephronwriter.com/latest/after-54-years-we-fell-in-\nlove-after-five-months-i-got-leukemia). She's also been lucky. Like me, she has a\ndevoted, astonishing circle of friends. Lovely homes in the W. Village (my dream\nneighborhood) and California; neighbors who formed a support community. My mini-\npangs were curtailed, though, by the dreadfulness of her treatment, centered on a rarely-\nattempted type of bone marrow transplant (haplo-cord transplant>adult donor blood is\ncombined with umbilical cord blood) -- which worked. Anyhoo, a few quotes from the\nbook stayed with me; I share them here, at random:\n>I was introduced to the expression \"casting crepe\" or \"hanging crepe,\" referring to\nwhen a doctor forecasts a bleak outcome for a patient. It references the custom of\nwidows wearing crepe for a year after their husbands' deaths. I suppose I took Dr.\nBeavis' prediction of my potentially shortened life span this way, while understanding\nthat I could be an outlier.\n>\"Being a patient in a hospital is the center of the world - a very small world, but I am\nthe definite center. Everyone is there for me. At the same time, I'm powerless. The\ncenter of the world but powerless.\" This paradox rings true.\n>An excellent description of how a close friendship deepened further during Delia's\nillness. I have experienced this before with a few friends: \"'What we experienced that\nweek was just the essence of what a true friendship is. It was sort of as if you and I had\ngone on a trip together. It deepened our friendship in such a profound way.' It was, I\nthink, my vulnerability, her having to assist with prosaic tasks, and, mostly, simply the\namount of time we were together. Conversations with purpose, conversations with\ndepth, conversations that meandered.  Silence. Sleep. Yes, even after years of endless\nphone calls and long lunches, we broke through to another level of comfort.\" YES:\nbreaking through to another comfort level...\n>On being a writer: \"My body may be gaining strength, but I am not writing. Both my\nscreenplay projects went south during my illness. I can't imagine sitting down in my\noffice at my laptop and having any thoughts spill out. This is huge. I am a writer first. It's\nsanity and comfort. But it's gone. That big piece of me is in a boat caught in a current,\ndrifting further and further away.\" It would take me more time/space/energy than I have\nright now to discuss how my illness (and retirement) have affected my feelings about my\nwork, my strong identity as a writer and at the same time my conflicted feelings about\nthe same. A conversation with my friend Andrew the other night, though, about\nsafeguarding my work as an important part of my legacy, got me back to my desk\nyesterday to finish up a long article that is almost done. I am motivated to send it off\n                    \nasap. And I've always loved personal writing, have an enormous trunk filled with my\ndiaries, dream books etc. and plan to also assemble stories, poems etc. currently lodged\nin my computer for whomever wishes to read them later.\n>A good description of my own 'flight' response; it resonates with me: \"I am curious\nabout many things and write about them - how people fall in love, why marriages beak\nup, family madness, family dynamics, psychological cruelties, childhood, the nature of\nfriendship - but about the science of saving my life, I know only this: if I do research I will\npanic, I will become hysterical, I will misunderstand, I will obsess. I don't even have an\nappetite for it. I'm not repressing curiosity. I simply trust my ability to choose people and\nthen abdicate.\"\n>I was introduced to the expression \"friend-daughters\" and realized I have several of\nthese, mainly former graduate and undergraduate students who have become cherished\nfriends, special friends because of the unusual nature of our professional/personal\nmentor/mentee relationship over many years (in part). I love them dearly. While I\ncertainly do not discount the extraordinary role of my male family members/friends,\nwomen  have played and continued to play a crucial role in my journey. I liked this quote\ntoo: \"I was amassing my women warriors. Looking back now, even before I decided, I\nwas assembling my troops.\"\n>On another note, a message from a woman (Kerri Grote) who recently passed from\ncancer, posted on Facebook by my friend Chris O. (yes, I am still on FB, which great\nambivalence), slammed the \"cancer survivorship as a battle\" metaphor much more\nforcefully than I did in my last post; kudos to her for helping me access my own feelings:\n\"But let me be crystal clear while I\u2019m able: I did not 'lose a battle' against cancer. This is a ridiculous,\nsteamy pile of horse shit that society has dumped on cancer patients. Western medicine, and\nWestern culture, especially, is so uncomfortable talking about death that instead it created this\n\u201cbattle\u201d analogy that basically shames people who die from cancer. News flash: None of us gets out\nalive from this rodeo called life. There is no shame in dying from cancer \u2013 or any serious illness. And\nit doesn\u2019t need to be a battle. It\u2019s a transition that each of us will go through.\"\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3087224811563411&set=a.1493039927648582\nFinally, I watched the TED talk, entitled \"What Really Matters at the End of Life,\" by one\nof my 'guides,' the hospice and palliative care physician (and triple amputee, following\nhis having  survived electrocution following an accident in college), B.J. Miller\n(https://www.ted.com/talks/bj_miller_what_really_matters_at_the_end_of_life). Watch it.\nIt's a compelling and clear-eyed talk that among many topics treats that of \"dying well\"\n(ars moriendi, something I hope to write about in another post). I like Miller's ideas about\naestheticizing death, replacing cold beeping hospital machines and isolation with beauty,\nsensual pleasure etc. (he spoke about the delight of having a snowball melt in his hands\nwhen he was hospitalized). I also liked this Miller quote so much I wrote it down: \"I am\nasking we make space so that aging and dying can become a process of crescendo\n                    \nthrough to the end.\" CRESCENDO THROUGH TO THE END.\n[Thank you, Mark F. and Michael, for providing some very useful clarity on end of life\nissues this week].\n[I am late in responding to a few recent emails, for which I am grateful; I hope/plan to do\nso this weekend].\nGrateful to hear this week from Gail G., after a little hiatus, Katerina, Clare, Zia [the\njuicing saga continues! I bought a Nutribullet] Denise [who I look forward to seeing for\nlunch in NY along with her husband Mike and our pal Richard, as I look forward to dinner\nwith Sandy and Cheryl this coming week], Kay (my dear friend whom I met when we\nwere about eleven years old and I spent a few summers in her hometown of Amherst,\nMA; we met while acting in a production of \"Tom Sawyer,\" remained friends through\nHarvard, followed parallel paths as humanities professors (she in English at UC Santa\nBarbara), mothered one son each, but are usually only in touch a few times a year, too\nfew); and for a slightly wet lunch with Nancy.

    "entry": "I wanted to write a brief post before leaving tomorrow for Mohonk. Rather, I will be at the\nGeisinger lab at 7:45 tomorrow to have blood drawn, then will meet Dr. Patel before\nproceeding to chemo. When that's all over, the 4+ hour drive to New Paltz. I've asked\nthe nurses not to give me any Benadryl to guarantee I'm alert. I'm slightly apprehensive\nbut hoping that I'll just ease into a driving groove, that the clear weather gods will be\nwith me, and that I can simply chill during the drive without excess fatigue. It's not ideal.\nBut it should work. Back Monday. I'm going to stay over in Tarrytown, NY after our lunch\n                    \nat Blue Stone Farms so I can be refreshed for my return drive on Monday. Ben will take\nthe bus from the city tomorrow late afternoon and I can't wait to have dinner with him at\nMohonk. The menus look enticing. Mohonk offers abundant activities but I may instead\nwish to curl up on our balcony overlooking Lake Mohonk with a good book. Yay, r&r!\nI've felt somewhat tired the past few days with some discomfort at top of my vagina (site\nof several tumors), lower back, and side. I've needed a lot of sleep, including several rest\nperiods during the day, and have relied on Tylenol and Oxycodone when needed. Of\ncourse it makes me worry about metastases (spine? brain?), tumor growth, progression\nof disease. Perhaps my CT-scan, likely planned for August, will be moved up (I'll confirm\ndate with Dr. Patel tomorrow). I suppose I could still be tired from recent travel to NY,\nstress surrounding the consult at MSK, bed hopping in Manhattan and Brooklyn, heat\nwave etc. So...much...uncertainty.\nThe question \"Is it ok to simply survive?\" popped out of my mouth when speaking via\nzoom with my therapist last Monday. I may have meant: \"Is it ethical to consume\nresources while not manifestly 'producing' anything tangible or laudable in return?\" (in\nmy case: publications, knowledge, learning etc.). Or I may have meant: \"Is it acceptable\nfor a lifelong *striver* such as myself to shift my focus to surviving on the days that\nseems about all I can handle?\" Or I may have meant: \"While *thriving* with cancer and\nenjoying the best possible quality of life remains my ultimate goal, should I simply cut\nmyself some slack on the days this proves challenging?\" Or I may have meant: \"Is\nsurvival enough to motivate me to press on?\" I grapple with these questions and don't\nnecessarily have an answer for them. I continue to set my sights on striving/thriving, of\ncourse, but those around me (as well as myself) need to know and accept that some\ndays I might only hit 80%, or 60%, or not at all (Ben, remember when I had to sit down\non your staircase for a rest because I couldn't manage the four flights in the heat?). Still\nquite a challenge for a highly-functioning person who can't escape niggling feelings of\nguilt or anxiety or disappointment or of disappointing others...\nStrive, thrive, survive: note that the concept of 'battling' or 'fighting' my disease is not\npart of this triumvirate.\nIt occurred to me the other day that I am into my *fourth* year of treatment. A milestone\nto be proud of, I suppose, but also one that lies close to the fateful five year mark by\nwhich, statistically, half of OC survivors are dead. That passage feels ominous. How\nmuch more of the \"poison cure\" can my body take? Is cancer taking a marked toll on me\nvisually (somehow, I care about that, although it seems trivial); do I look progressively\n'marked for death?' At the same time, memories of the vacations that have marked each\nof the four summers since my diagnosis are wonderful to return to. 2019: I was in rough\nshape recovering from my thirteen hour debulking surgery at Hopkins and was very sad\nto forego the trip to Lyon that I had planned for Ben and myself, but was delighted that\nBen and Sammi could go in my stead, enjoy a fabulous wine tour with a French friend of\n                    \nArnold's, stay in a swanky hotel in a renovated townhouse, indulge in Lyonnais\ngastronomy. 2020: Chatham, a fabulous week at the Chatham Bars Inn, an outstanding\nhotel on the beach. Lots of local seafood, a day in Provincetown, spa treatments, a long\ncar ride filled up with podcasts, chitchat etc.; the Cape is one of my favorite places.\n2021: East Hampton/Amagansett. Magnificent beach, seafood, cooking, the Hamptons\nvibe, a visit with my high school friend Eva. Driving back to the city through Hurricane\nHenri was scary, though, although we did make a pit stop to have some A+ Long Island\npizza. It was great having Sammi with us part of the time. 2022: ?.\nOk, I'm smiling now. Must go finish packing for tomorrow's trip. Be well, everyone.\n \nPhotos",

Yes, its ok just to survive is the reflexive answer that comes to mind. But know\nthat you've enriched my life, moved me, opened me to new experience and way of\nthinking about things in these two posts. So even if you're not feeling productive, your\nlife may indeed be generative (i.e., for others). Four of my family members have chronic\nor acute cancer struggles now, and the way family members are treating each other\n(and me) is depressing. It's wonderful to have a different model to absorb.\nAnd who knows how you affected the schmuck behind his own mask of rage and\ncynicism and lies and aggression, just by being yourself? Good for you for leaving him in\nthe barnyard dust. [And by the way, I went to that market once (or one very similar in\ncentral PA) and would love to go again sometime. ]\n  \u2014Mark Feinberg, August 7, 2022  \n  \nAugust 5, 2022 - Why I won't be going back there...",

    "entry": "[Catching up; further posts on recent days to follow, hopefully]\nHaving begun to reacclimate after our wonderful Hudson Valley idyll (about which, more\nsoon) and also having begun to climb out of a post-idyll health-related slip into a slump\n(about which, more soon too), I'm back to my State College rhythms: meals out with\nfriends (this past week at the Ale House with my gals Monique and Kathryn; this Sunday,\nbrunch at the Naked Egg with my gal Maria; next Tuesday coffee at Rothrock with my gal\nHelen, to whom I just recommended the hysterical/poignant \"Fire Island\" on Hulu, which I\nloved); to/from chemo car rides with my gals Janis and Jackie, mini-gab fests included;\ncountry drives; farmers markets and cooking (delicious tomato/watermelon soup\nadapted from the delectable one we sampled last Sunday at Blue Hill at Stone Barns\n(more tomato dishes - pie? jam? chutney? - to come); reading (Colm Toibin's _Brooklyn,_\nliking the novel/Toibin's style). I sleep oddly, punctuated by awake periods throughout\nthe night when I usually read NYTimes articles. The result is fatigue; must stay off my\ndevices!\nToday I made my annual-ish trip to a farmers market about 25 miles or so away, the Old\nSchool Market in - you guessed it - an old elementary school near Lamar, PA. Produce, a\nflea market, a small animal auction, a food court, butcher etc.; I was attracted by some\nvery nice (and inexpensive) planters they used to sell early in the summer, but didn't see\nany plants today. This trip also allowed me to stop at The Cakeshop by Tati, the\nphenomenal bakery en route to the market (but a good 9 miles from my house), to snag\na few croissants and a tiramisu, my favorite dessert. Tati (Tatiana, the baker, who is from\nPeru) produced my gorgeous birthday cake, the best cake of its kind I have ever eaten,\nbar none (although I fondly remember my childhood birthday cakes, usually purchased\nat the Gramercy Park Bake Shop [about which many more memories!], layered thick with\nsugary buttercream and bedecked with plastic ballerina figurines in a circle on the cake's\ntop).\nAnd I probably won't return to this particular market in Salona, PA. When Sammi gamely\nmade the trip there with me in 2020, the election campaign was in full gear, and a huge\nTrump flag bedecked an entire wall of the market. It should have tipped me off, but\nthese displays are not uncommon once I leave the protective cocoon of State College. \nFor the first time ever, I was actually harassed FOR wearing a mask inside a building!\nThe harasser was a central Pennsylvanian of a type that abounds in these parts: older\nman (70s? 80s?), slightly stooped, baseball cap, short sleeve checked shirt w/t-shirt\nunderneath, and khakis. Nothing objectionable there. \nAs I entered the school building:\n                    \nHarasser: Are you about to hold someone up? [I understood immediately where he was\ncoming from]\nMe: Why?\nH.: Well, you look like you're about to hold someone up.\nMe [starting to feel I'm being triggered in ways that absolutely incense me; too bad I\ndidn't have my AK-47 on me lol, I could have bought all the ammo I needed from a stand\nin the 'flea market' in the Old School; people have been shot for much less in this\ncountry...] Actually, I have cancer, which compromises my immune system. I am wearing\nthis mask to protect myself, but also to protect you. Next time you think about masking,\nperhaps you should remember me.\nH: [mumbles something apologetically]. Does it bother you? [I presumed he meant the\nmask and not cancer; I also now wonder if he meant no more than 'is the mask annoying\nto wear?,' as it is for all of us to greater or lesser degrees that we simply accept, but was\ntempted to ask him whether he meant \"does it bother you not only physically, but also\nideologically, politically, ethically, etc.?\"]\nMe: No. Does it bother you?\nH: [smiles disingenuously] Sometimes.\nI could feel my voice rising, with others overhearing our conversation, so I decided to\nmove on. In retrospect, I had wanted to say: \"Is there a policy *forbidding* the wearing\nof masks here?\" AND \"The next time you see someone masked indoors, please put aside\nyour ideology, your crazy adherence to the lies of Trump and his cronies, and your\ndisbelief in science, and think of me, if you're unable to direct your empathy to a broader\ncircle of your human brothers and sisters.\"\nHaving stopped short of a rant (I wonder what held me back?), I continued on to the 'flea\nmarket.' There was no a.c. and it was sweltering. One vendor was snoozing at her stand,\nanother one remarked to a third: \"Well, some days are simply not good days. Do you\nneed any money?\" I felt badly for them, then came upon the stand selling ammo for\nAK-47s, 9 mms etc. Again, not an unexpected sight around here in Pennsyltucky, but my\nphoto reveals all that is tragically, profoundly wrong in our country (or parts of it) today.\nLet's decode: The ammo, plentiful and not exorbitantly expensive imo, speaks for itself.\nThe poster to its left, which featured at one time politically neutral American iconography\nthat has in recent decades been fully coopted by the Tumpers (American flag, eagle,\nmusket man) reads \"God, guns & guts (often amended around here to \"God, guns and\nTrump\") made America free/Let's keep it that way.\" And at the pinnacle of this triangular\ndisplay, a poster advocating Doug Mastriano for governor. Mastriano's views, should my\n                    \nnon-PA brethren and sisters be uninformed, fall at the extremist fringe of his own party:\nhe made payments to Gab, an extremist social media site to which the shooter in the\ninfamous 2018 Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh belongred, for its\nconsulting services. In fact, Mastriano has long rubbed elbows w/anti-Semites and anti-\nSemitism, which he now claims to 'abhor' (perhaps he's an anti-Semite of the Alex Jones\nstripe, obsessed with nightmare visions of the nefarious influence of a \"Jewish mafia\").\nMastriano also opposes abortion *for any reason,* and has made this a cornerstone of\nhis campaign. An election denial activist, Mastriano has warned that he will decertify\nvoting machines in counties whose results seem (to him) suspect. Under the\nparticularities of PA law, he has unusually wide latitude to do this. And he laid out cash\nfrom his State Senate campaign to transport supporters to the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on 6\nJanuary 2020.\nPlease come to PA this fall to help keep our governorship blue! But will Pennsyltucky\nreally go for \"the Jew and the Black,\" conforming to notable perceptions of former state\nattorney general Josh Shapiro and Austin Davis, who may well lose in the fall. And please\nkeep our former lieutenant governor and current Senate candidate John Fetterman\n(running against snake oil salesman and carpet bagger extraordinaire, Mehmet Oz), an\nimpressive candidate with an unconventional persona, healthy, even *alive,* as he holds\nhis first rally today in Erie, after suffering a stroke in May that by his own admission,\ncombined with other health issues, might have killed him.\nEnd of rant. For now. But \"be afraid, be very afraid.\" Then get angry. And then do\nsomething.\nAfter being traumatized by my experience at the Old School Market, it was lovely to stop\nat Shemp's greenhouses and market on my way home, where I picked up some excellent\nlooking produce: heirloom tomatoes and a large head of garlic. And as most Saturdays\nI'll stop by the Amish market run by the friendly family at Hillside Farm, five mn. from my\nhome, where the bounty of August is reaching a crescendo, showcasing swelling mounds\nof green beans, eggplants, tomatoes, melons, okra, zucchini, peppers, cherries, peaches,\nblueberries, blackberries, basil, beets, fennel etc. + all the Amish baked and canned\ngoods that I don't really care for.\nMore soon w/health news (no major updates for now, but as usual, some developments).\nBe well.\nI badly owe some emails. Will make every effort to get to them this weekend!\n                    \n \nPhotos",

XO\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, August 6, 2022  \nUgh, maddening but predictable. I no longer waste my breath with these people. His\nexplanation that you looked like a masked bandit speaks to the deeply ingrained fear (of\nkarmic retribution perhaps) that is at the heart of white supremacy.

As for not returning\nto a place with so many triggers, know that one of my doctors left the Geisinger system\n(and the state) because she couldn't stand dealing with all the right-wingers in the\nDanville area.

I have been thinking about it for a few days. What possessed people in this\ncountry to be so mean spirited, selfish, small-minded and judgmental in a time of\nhardship\u2026? I am so sorry you had to deal with that - on an outing that was intended to\nlift your spirits and do something enjoyable. What a friggin jerk (to use mild language).\nYou really deflated his pompous gaseous self with your elegant restraint ! Good for you!\nYet I just hate that you even had to deal with the ugly bastard!

    "entry": "As classes begin at Penn State in two weeks, my psyche finds itself hard-wired, even in\nthis second post-retirement year, to spew anxiety dreams. This one was a variant of \"I'm\nthe instructor in charge of a class, it's the first day, I'm not prepared, and I'm worried\nabout the outcome\" (do note that I've also appeared as a student in this type of dream\nbefore). In the dream, I spend at least 15 mn futzing around with AV equipment etc. in\nfront of a large, full auditorium before introducing myself to the class. Surprisingly (and\nI've had a version of this dream before too), the many students in the class have stuck\nwith me, are still in their seats, and are attentive as I start class, although they've been\nnoisy before class starts.\nIn writing this just now, I realize that I may well have amended the description of my\ndream thus: \"I'm the cancer patient, I feel unprepared for what's ahead, and worry about\nthe outcome.\"\nOnce again, at this 'commencement,' I find myself anxious about how I'll organize my\ntime going forward, what I wish to accomplish etc., with my identities as a cancer patient\nand a scholar seeming to merge (and conflict, coincide etc.) in this instance. Part of me\nis attracted to the thought of simply sitting around and waiting to die while the other\npart, the one that won me over, is drawn to identifying some discrete projects to work on\n-- while of course faced with a wall of uncertainty concerning next steps in my treatment.\nMy thinking often tends to be quite binary* in this way -- all or nothing, death or life, give\nup or soldier on etc. (*except when it comes to my thoughts on gender and sexual\nidentity!). I'm also aware of not wanting to scare anyone, to not bring any further pain to\nloved ones. While I feel some obligation to continue to 'live large' (for me, but also for my\nfriends and family), I also wonder if this long *slog* might be unduly wearing. Another\nbinary, I supposed.\nFor the very first time today, I realized that I also have the option of stopping treatment.\nI won't do that, but not feeling well the past few days plus being consumed with anxiety\nabout my (as yet nonexistent, I realize) plans for endgame scenarios have only\naccentuated my feeling of slogging...\nIf I stopped treatment, I wouldn't be able to:\n*witness the leaves change color;\n*prepare for a joyous New Year (5782) by cooking foods, preparing the table, joining\nfellow congregants at services, observing tashlich etc.\n*dangle my feet in a deliciously chilly creek;\n*spend time with loved ones.\nMy scans (MRI, CT-scan) are scheduled for the end of August/beginning of September\n(I've forgotten the exact dates). Obviously, these are major assessment points, which will\n                    \nhelp determine next steps, especially if there's been progression. My 'scanxiety' has\nintensified the already perfect storm of factors that I am simply trying to hold right now,\nie:\n>Last office visit with Dr. Patel put me in a bit of a state. He seemed distracted and his\nbest bedside manner was not in evidence. Instead, he complained amply about staffing\nshortages (which impact when appointments can be scheduled and often delay them\ndue to lack of providers), issues with insurance companies, and layers of bureaucratic\nimpasse, which, as he said, were preventing him from helping cancer patients, especially\nmany of the younger ones he was treating. While he did not threaten to quit (well,\nperhaps he did...), he made a 'washing his hands of it' gesture, to indicate that there\nwere times he felt that frustrated he simply wished to be done with it. I blurted out\n\"Please don't quit; we need you!\" I certainly get where he's coming from, and feel badly\nfor him (we need more oncologists in this town and Covid, plus the repeal of Roe, have\nput huge strains on the medical profession) but I hope he appreciates how vulnerable\nthis can make patients feel, too. I would not unload my gripes about academia on my\nstudents, for example. I just don't find it appropriate.\n>Very low magnesium readings, which mean a number of important biochemical\nreactions in my body are out of whack. I'm currently getting two additional magnesium\ninfusions a week.\n>Chronic diarrhea, very depleting (and depleting of electrolytes such as magnesium).\nStill trying to get it under control with additional magnesium infusions.\n>Fatigue;\n>Stomach ache; discomfort in various parts of my stomach, but no real pain. And vital\nsigns good!\n>My CA125 level (measure of a protein, used to detect amount of cancer in the blood)\nhas doubled since last blood test, jumping from 11 to 22. It is still within the range\nconsidered normal (<38), though. I've heard diametrically opposed views about whether\nthis should be a concern; to Dr. Patel it's 'just a number,' to Dr. Beavis, it's no longer a\ngood indicator for me (not sure why). Nevertheless, it is *one* indicator among several,\nand I'm anxious to see whether it belongs to a trend or is an outlier.\n>Watching a video created for _The New Yorker_ entitled \"Documenting my Wife's Final\nDays on Social Media,\" another attempt to demystify conversations about death by\ndocumenting them graphically and publicly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i-\nTvqmjsBw The woman in question was dying, in her mid-fifties, of late-stage ovarian\ncancer. While I found much to admire in the honesty of this documentary, the specter of\nKathy's physical decay gave me the willies, like the worst Halloween spook you could\n                    \nimagine. Scary stuff.\n>Realizing at about 4 a.m. that I actually have no plan for endgame, have not explored\nnursing care, home care options etc., which is likely what would feel most comfortable\nfor me. I did begin to inquire with some of the nurses in the infusion room today and will\nfollow up. A lot of this seems daunting and time- and energy-consuming, though. My\nhouse cleaner, because she's facing challenges herself, cannot clean for a while, and just\nfinding someone to help clean and straighten my currently messy house is an ordeal. My\ngoal is to stay independent until I can no longer do so, but it occurred to me that I don't\nhave a caregiver! My friends have been extraordinary in helping me with all sorts of\nerrands, food etc. but I'm envisioning a much heavier lift at some point, one that friends\nand family may not be equipped for. When that point will be, I still don't know! \nHopefully, less slogging and more thriving await! Will see what the next days bring.",

    "entry": "On days when I'm not feeling great, a text or call from a friend or family member feels\nlike a lifeline. So I picked up my phone immediately when I saw \"Jackie C's\" name and\nheard her warm, slightly low, lilting Scottish accent on the other end, offering to come by\n(or get together) and to pick up some groceries for me. Suffice to say that as a survivor\n(of o.c. and beyond), Jackie gets how these physical>mental slumps work. We'll meet, sit\non my porch and have a cold drink, talk, or go for a short walk on Friday. It was also\nlovely to hear from my dear grad school friend Vinni, reminding me that we were to\ncatch up by phone today (to my chagrin and uncharacteristically, I had forgotten to note\nthis in my datebook, so I needed to move our phone call to today, and look forward to it).\nI think this 'survivors' club' may have some special intuition about when lifelines are\nneeded. And Ben has of course been checking in regularly. [And thank you, Shanny and\nMartina, for your phone calls too, and Melissa for your text and apt poem by Rilke! So\ngood to hear from you. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm able]. I'm still not feeling great,\nbut perhaps a bit better than a few days ago. I was at my neuro-oncologist's yesterday\nand was told that I didn't need to resume taking steroids for the discomfort on the right\nside of my skull, caused by inflammation stemming from my brain operation in January.\nThe brain isn't really my main concern right now anyway; the problem's my\nabdominal/pelvic area, breathlessness and fatigue.\nMy getaway with Ben was also a lifeline. Three summer trips with him since diagnosis! A\nfourth had been planned for summer 2019 but my debulking surgery intervened, and so I\nsent Ben and Sammi on their fabulous trip to Paris, Lyon and Annecy instead of my\njoining Ben for the trip.\nI surprised myself by embarking on the four hour drive to the Hudson Valley immediately\nfollowing chemo last Thursday, and it hardly tired me out. I checked into our wonderful,\nupdated 'vintage' room (the original lodge dates to the early 19th c.), with a working\nfireplace, dark wood moldings, antique furniture, no t.v. (yay!) and a balcony overlooking\nLake Mohonk, to be viewed peacefully from two Adirondack chairs. Ben arrived soon\nafter. We now have a joke that involves one of us flinging open a hotel door to reveal the\nother standing on the threshold in a new and unexpected location -- we've now\nrendezvoused (sp??) in hotels in Besan\u00e7on and Montpellier, France, my apartment in the\nrue Paul Bert in Paris and now - Mohonk Mountain House (Ben, have there been others? I\nthink so...). Somehow, we always get a big laugh out of finding one another on the\nthresholds of random hotel rooms in far flung locations in Europe and the States, which\nthen becomes the pretext for big hugs and more gales of laughter.\nAlthough there were plenty of kids there, I liken MMH to \"camp for grownups.\" We\nobserved many multi-generational families, likely returnees and skewing (although not\nexclusively) towards preppy. A dizzying array of activities was available -- yoga, tai chi,\nPilates, water sports, hiking and nature walks, house history tours, music, meditation,\n                    \ntennis, horseback rides, golf, spa treatments + three (more than) square a day. I enjoyed\nreading on our deck overlooking Lake Mohonk and the Catskills, a mild hike around the\nlake, relaxing in the rowboat while Ben flexed his muscles rowing me across the lake (we\ndrifted ashore a few times!), a house history tour (as at Bedford Spring, decades of\niconography decorate the walls; unlike Bedford, MMK was the site of various\ninternational conferences about pacifism and equitable treatment of the indigenous\npeoples in the area); and excellent music, part of their annual Festival of the Arts (one\ngroup, Miss Maybell and the Jazz Age, was recently featured on NPR; another, Birdland\nJazz Guitar, played lots of standards from the American Songbook). I found *everything*\nat MMH to be of  the highest quality - no skimping). Yes, it is pricey, but I have such a\ndifferent sense of the value of money these days...; ie you can't take it with you... Ben\nwas more adventuresome than me when I couldn't be, easy enough to do in the perfect\nweather we experienced: he swam across the lake, played golf; and climbed through the\nLemon Squeeze (a series of very narrow passageways through boulders) to the summit\nof one of the most difficult trails.\nMeals were served in about five different settings for us to choose from; in fact, there are\nusually so many people at MMH (at full capacity, apparently) that one's meal\ntimes/locations are pre-scheduled, but we were able to tweak our schedule a bit. The\nenormous main dining room w/dramatic views of the property at sunset is somewhat\n'upscale' and features 'continental' or vaguely locavore cuisine. The fish was tasty and\nBen tucked into various types of steak during our visit. The servers -- largely hospitality\nstudents from abroad -- our server hailed from Poland and wore a cute bow-tie - were\nlovely. We also took many meals at The Grange, an outdoor dining area w/checkered\npicnic tables overlooking the lake and a large grilling/serving station set up in the center\n(>camp for grown-ups!). Every day brought a staggering selection of grilled meats,\nnumerous types of sausages, burgers, fish, ribs, dishes cooked in cast iron pans (eg\ncornbread), plus many other entrees, salads (shrimp and fennel), fruit salads, desserts --\nall very tasty. We know how lucky we are!\nWe had plenty of time to be both serious and silly, to have bits of  Big Conversations and\nmake small talk, to collaborate on the NYTimes Spelling Bee etc. Recently, when I\ndecided (after speaking with my therapist) to try to shift to a 'process talk' with Ben and\nask whether he felt ok about how, when etc. we've been going about talking about\nissues revolving around my cancer, he replied, \"It's all good, mom, I feel I can talk to you\nabout anything, any time.\" Be still my heart :) I think my work might be done here for\nnow.\nSunday we left MMH around 11:00 and took the 'scenic route' along one bank of the\nHudson River, through New Hamburg, Beacon etc. (New Paltz, where MMH is located and\nwhere my nephew Isaac will be headed for college in the fall, seemed to have a bit of\nhippy-dippy vibe, \u00e0 la Woodstock?). Tarrytown seemed affluent and was largely Legend\nof Sleepy Hollow/Rip van Winkle themed. We found our destination, Stone Barn Center\n                    \nfor Food and Agriculture (est. by David Rockefeller; the Rockefellers seem to own half\nthe town, as well as adjacent Pocantico Hills).\nWe had reserved for lunch at the gorgeous Stone Barns at Blue Hill, perhaps the east\ncoast pendant to Thomas Keller's French Laundry or Alice Waters' Chez Panisse? At least\nthat's how I imagined it. In this temple to organic agriculture and farm to table\ngastronomy, we headed towards the 'cafeteria,' forgoing the several hundred dollar\nlunch/dinner, thank you very much (only offered during the week, in any case). Out\n'cafeteria' lunch allowed us to sample about eight or so of the dishes made from their\ningredients, all grown or produced on site (including all their meats and a variety of\ninteresting grains). In a clean but nondescript industrial looking space, an employee\nserved and explained to us what we'd be eating: the most delicious gazpacho I've ever\nsampled (pureed w/watermelon) - I've since replicated it at home - roasted beets with\nslices of plum and pine nuts, homemade ricotta cheese whipped up with ?, another\ncondiment (something pickled...), a slice of roast beef, a large spelt cookie filled with\nblackberry jam, corn lemonade, delicious miche made from one of their unusual grains. \nWe ate outdoors under a billowing white tent beside the stone barns, next to a small\nstand selling Blue Hill's produce and products (I bought some luscious rhubarb jam). We\nmight have been in Tuscany or northern Cali, but there seemed something distinctively\nAmerican about the scene -- I've tried, but I can't put my finger on what that was. It was\nhot, and my energy was fading, so we toured the impressive greenhouses on our own\n(cumin plants, which I've never seen before, and many interesting varieties of onions)\nbefore leaving.\nI drove Ben to the Tarrytown train station so he could return to the city (we were not far,\nin fact, from his late Berkman grandparents' house in Hartsdale, which witnessed many\nof Ben's best childhood memories, shared with his Berkman cousins). As it was about 3\np.m. and I was feeling worn out, I decided neither to drive all the way home nor to\nhunker down in Tarrytown for the night but to try to make some progress in getting\ncloser to SC. I aimed for Harrisburg, tempted by both a b and b I like, City House, and my\ngo-to old school Italian bakery, Alvaro's. The *long* (4-5 hours) drive to Harrisburg was\nexacerbated by a rainstorm the last hour. I was exhausted. But I made it to City House,\nwhere I watched a mindless hour of \"Ninety Day Fianc\u00e9\" and ate a piece of pizza I had\npicked up at reputedly the best pizzeria in Harrisburg, in one of its many dingy\nneighborhood. Like Baltimore, Harrisburg has much to recommend it (although on a\nsmaller scale, of course) but also many sad, blighted areas ripe for improvement. I slept\nlike a rock in my cozy room fronting the Susquehanna. Picked up some coffee the next\nmorning at Little Amps, a cute caf\u00e9 in the capital's renovated historic district downtown.\nThe owners of Alvaro's must have thought I was strange to have taken such a detour --\nor obsessed with their cookies and pasta (which I am) -- when they saw how crestfallen I\nlooked to find their bakery closed just as they were putting out garbage cans and getting\ninto their car to head off on vacation. I had forgotten that the shop is closed the first two\n                    \nweeks in August. I wished them a lovely vacation, then retreated like a sad dog with her\ntail between her legs. I'll be back, I hope. Road trip?\nHealth updates: received magnesium infusion yesterday. Have additional med to take for\ndiarrhea, hoping my abdomen will calm down over weekend. Dr. Patel, who stopped by\nthe infusion room yesterday (waking me up from a pleasant nap), suggested upping my\npain med dosage, said fatigue, breathless caused by lowered red blood cells from\nchemo. I'm inferring there is no way to 'fix' this, but I forgot to ask that explicitly. I'll do\nso on Tuesday, when I have a next mag infusion. Still short of breath, tired - ugh - but\nlikely no worse. Back to chemo next week unless things change. MSK still 'tracking' me,\nwanting to know my treatment schedule etc. I'm glad.\n \nMy friend Melissa sent me a quote from Rilke (\"Letters to a Young Poet,\" pub. 1929) that\nresonated with me in this particular moment:\n\u201cSo you mustn\u2019t be frightened, if a sadness rises in front of you, larger than any you\nhave ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloud-shadows, moves over your hands and\nover everything you do. You must realize that something is happening to you, that life\nhas not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall.\"\n \n \n \n \nPhotos",

A few years later, on a trip\nup from NYU, during a walk on the grounds, Alina and I decided to get engaged. And\nseveral years after that, when living in Cornwall-on-Hudson for a bit, we would go cross-\ncountry skiing at Mohonk, parking just beyond the grounds, next to a lovely little Swiss\nrestaurant, where we'd have fondue after skiing, for a thoroughly d\u00e9paysant, Alpine\nexperience in Ulster County, NY!\n(Now I'm not sure that my comment will boost morale by exactly the 28.2% that\nCaringBridge promises, but if any of this brings a smile to your face, I'll be glad to have\nwritten it.)\n  \u2014Michael Garval, August 12, 2022  \nHuge thanks for this new travelogue, which has both of us dreaming about a trip to\nMohonk!

    "entry": "Overall, I'm not feeling too badly, with some ups and downs. I was able to move my MRI\nup about five days, from Sept. 2 to August 29th, as I was experiencing headaches earlier\nin the week (in the front of my head) and this makes me extremely anxious. Fortunately,\nthe headaches seem to have subsided but I'm nevertheless eager (yet anxious as hell) to\nknow if any brain mets have recurred. CT-scan set for 9/6. Thanks to a good suggestion\nby Dr. Beavis, I'm seeing a palliative care doctor here on Aug. 29th. Dr. Beavis again\nstressed to me that palliative care is *not* the same thing as hospice: so far, *none* of\nmy doctors has mentioned the possibility of my stopping treatment and entering into the\nnext phase. 'Palliative care' has to do with pain management in serious illness (at least\nthat's how I understand it), and tends to treat the 'whole person' rather than a patient to\nwhom prescriptions are routinely doled out. Palliative care doctors might also suggest\n'alternative' treatments for pain such as acupuncture, yoga or... tiramisu! The wonderful\npalliative care doctor who treated me at Hopkins before my brain operation in January,\nas soon as she found out I loved tiramisu, kept bringing me that dessert from different\nplaces around Baltimore, so we could compare and contrast (she loves the dessert, too).\nPerhaps not the healthiest option for me but... it was fun! I was surprised to learn that I\neven have access to a palliative care doc in State College - I believe it's a relatively new\nspecialty - but this doctor is here once a week, so ... we'll see. The effects of Friday's\nchemo do not seem to be too bad, at least as of now. My magnesium count is up a bit,\nwhich is good. I had an extra magnesium infusion this week, during which I was annoyed\nby the patient on my right blabbling loudly the whole time into her cell phone, despite\nmy fairly violent \"shush-ing\" of her and several interventions by one of the nurses, and\nby the patient on the left, whose ring tone also loudly blared an anthem by country\nsinger Lee Greenwood of which I'm not fond: \"And I'm proud to be an American/'cause at\nleast I know I'm FREEEEEEEE!\" \nOtherwise, my memory of the last two weeks or so is of feeling up and down. Some days\nI was so tired it was a struggle to get out of bed or even make my bed (which I hardly\never fail to do). A few nights I think I slept in my clothes; I had no energy. Then I began\nperking up (perhaps the effects of the  Avastin had been wearing me down and were\nsubsequently wearing off?) and regaining energy. Dr. Beavis found me looking \"vibrant\nand fantastic\" in a picture I sent her of Ben and me at Mohonk. Ridin' the roller coaster.\nMy sleep is still very erratic. Last night I slept about eleven hours, soundly. The night\nbefore I barely slept two or three. I was worrying about my long end-stage 'to do' list:\nneed to downsize, make appointment with lawyer and tweak my will a bit, see rabbi\nabout funeral arrangements, finalize list of my wishes (now a hodge-podge of notes and\nideas). Needless to say, *nothing is (or appears to be) imminent;* I guess I'm just hard-\nwired to be worried about one 'to-do list' or another. \nIt is comforting, helpful and fun to have Ben home, for a week in this case.  Ben played\n                    \ngolf with Michael a few times and spent time at his home, but Michael was nice enough\nto offer to have Ben sleep at my house the whole time, so he could help me out. Ben was\nworking during the day, but we were able to make/share some good meals (my cooking\ngene kicked in and produced heirloom tomato tart, pasta with pesto and scallops, spicy\nroast carrot salad, peach crostada, tomato, basil and mozza salad, tomato jam and\nmore). He helped me with lots of chores around the house. Michael and Sue grilled\nburgers and hot dogs for us one night at their place. Ben and I watched _The Deer\nHunter,_ which I don't believe I had seen since it came out. Powerful, amazing movie that\nhas stood the test of time. Stunning acting by the young Robert de Niro, Christopher\nWalken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale. It had me remembering two young men I knew in the\nearly 70s, when they were just home from 'nam (one was a guy I worked with at NYU\nlibrary, when I had my first summer job as a shelver; the other was the son of the\nsuperintendent of our apartment building in NY - he would just sit on the fire escape and\nsmoke cigarettes all day, and I had a few strange conversations with him). \nThe sun was shining on the graduation of my (ostensibly) last Ph.D. student, Morgane, a\nwonderful occasion. Morgane's husband, Aaron, also received his doctorate that day\nabout a week ago. The ceremony itself is a bit 'meh,' but I was grateful to be around to\njoin Morgane on this day that marked the apogee of seven (?) years of hard work on her\npart, and happy to have contributed in any small way to helping her reach her goal.\nPSU classes start tomorrow and, like last year, I am sad (depressed?) not to be a part of\nit (but yes, of course, grateful for the 35 years I did have, but still....sad). I always loved\nthe first day of class, certainly as a teacher if not as much as a student, loved the energy\nand excitement, the bustle on campus, the anticipation, the performative aspect of the\nfirst day: \"It's showtime, folks.\" And I love teaching, working with students, and being in\na university setting. I had thought about taking myself away to the beach and holing up\nfor a few days with some good books (currently reading Salman Rushdie's _Joseph\nAnton_) but the hotels I was interested in on the Delaware shore were all booked. Maybe\nanother time soon. This week will hopefully bring a few diversions, including a little road\ntrip to Alvaro's in Harrisburg next Saturday.\nI had a scary dream the other night: I was driving in a car. I was alone and seemed to be\non a country road, even in a forest. It may have been night. All of a sudden, I saw a cute\nlittle bear cub on the side of the road and thought, \"Oh, how cute.\" As I went further,\nthough, I saw that there were other cubs, and a mama bear too. At this point, I needed\nto be concerned not only about my safety but also by the fact that the animals were\ntrying to cross the road and/or were approaching my car. I drove on, navigating the\ndriving as best I could, as more and more menacing animals began to appear. Wolves!!\nSoon there were terrifying animals surrounding my car, trying to cross the road,\napproach or even mount the car etc. I focused all my frightened energy on trying to\nnavigate this horrifying situation as best I could, struggling to 'get through.' What a scary\nmetaphor for riding the rough waves of serious illness -- all alone, in this case.\n                    \nThere was a second dream that I don't remember well. It wasn't as overtly frightening,\nbut it involved my being in a difficult situation: I needed to put small items (like a roll of\npaper towels) back in their correct spot, but within some sort of absolutely enormous\nspace, ship, hotel or something of that nature; it went on for miles and miles. There were\nsome people around, but no one could help me with my laborious, Herculean task. I was\nearnestly giving this daunting mission my best shot, but it seemed tremendously\ndifficult.\nI owe some emails, dear friends! I am working through them and it's a pleasure to write.\nDon't despair of me, as sometimes I get delayed by not feeling well, visits etc.\n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "Although I'm grateful for every day, this past week had a bit of a \"it just kinda happened\"\nfeel. I do recall struggling with fatigue and spending a lot of time on my couch napping,\nresting or reading. At times this felt discouraging. I continue to be plagued by diarrhea\n(hopefully not tmi?!), which I do my best to try to control with medication, and by the\nconsequent loss of magnesium, which can feel very depleting and that this coming week\nwill again be countered by additional magnesium infusions. My labs this week revealed\nanother increase in my CA125 level; it's gone from 11 to about 22 to about 27. Say what\nyou will about this indicator being only one among several (with imaging likely the most\nimportant one), I still feel that the increase over two months can't be a good sign, as my\nown 'good' level has rarely risen above the teens. Chemo on Friday went smoothly, and\nI'm grateful to both Janis (whose younger brother died recently) and Jackie for being so\nkind as to continue to provide my transportation that day. My neuropathy, especially in\nmy right foot/leg, has become a bit more irritating. I feel I should be pushing myself to\nexercise more, but find myself short of breath and fatigued. Still feeling a bit 'aimless'\nnow that Penn State's fall semester is underway; I continue to feel tethered to the\nacademic calendar, its rhythms and expectations.\nDespite all this, things could certainly be worse. Please send your good thoughts and\nenergy my way beginning tomorrow, when I have my brain MRI at 7:45 p.m. -- in fact,\ntomorrow I'll experience a quadruple-whammy of medical appointments, with a\nmagnesium infusion, meeting with palliative care doctor, and eye doctor appointment\nadded to the mix!\nI did rally sufficiently on Wednesday to enjoy a lovely dinner at the Allen Street Grill with\nmy pals Kathryn, Sandy and Cheryl. And I perked up in a big way -- this can happen -- on\nSaturday, in time for a road trip to Harrisburg with pals Maria and Helen, destination\nAlvaro's Italian Bread and Pastry Shop, which Helen knew already and which I had been\nvaunting to Maria for months. After a delicious breakfast there (omelets, sfogliattella,\ncappuccino), we loaded up on Italian entr\u00e9es for dinner (spaghetti and stuffed eggplant),\nhome baked Italian bread, Italian cookies and gelato. Lots of interesting convo with these\ntwo and a convivial time. Definitely gave me a boost.\nIn fact, I surprised myself by my 'perkiness' on Saturday, as I had only slept a few hours\nthe night before -- this happens too. One [feature? advantage?] of this late stage of my\ncancer journey is that the night hours often bring an opportunity for a 'deep dive' into\nthe history of a friendship, a relationship, an event in my life. Friendships, for example,\nspool out onto the canvas of my mind with great clarity, allowing me to appreciate them\nin all their particularity (how exactly *did* I become friends with that person, fifty years\nago? What memories do I associate with them? What were we like then, and now?).\nWhile I'm certainly bummed not to be able to sleep on nights when I am 'visited' by\nthese cosmic forays into the nooks and crannies of my life, I don't become anxious\n                    \nbecause important realities are manifesting themselves to me. So for now I'll refrain from\n\"fixing a hole where the rain comes in, and stops my mind from wandering, where it will\ngo...\" I just let my mind wander...\nNot overly tired today, either. I slept soundly and likely recovered my sleep debt from\nFriday night. Finished up a piece I've been writing for Ben, then took a relaxing drive out\nroute 45. Leaves are beginning to fall. Many Amish in their 'Sunday best' returning from\nchurch or out driving in their buggies in the nice weather. All roadside stands closed: \"No\nSunday sales.\" Took a short nap and spoke to my dear (and only) aunt, Marlene Green,\nfor nearly an hour. Hope to make some zucchini pancakes with feta for dinner.\nSaturday night I watched a memorable film: _Coda._ I know it's received flak from some\nparts of the deaf community; I also know that it relies on some familiar tropes (coming of\nage; inspiring teacher; rebellion against v. loyalty to family). However, the setting in\nwhich these narratives play out, and the extraordinary acting, are so fresh, poignant and\noriginal that I am still thinking about the film today while continuing to tear up, as I did\nduring most of the film! I'm reading Salman Rushdie's fictional memoir, _Joseph Anton,_\na long, intriguing book. I'll try to share further reactions once I've finished.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Health update: I will have my CT-Scan this coming Tuesday. Then, it can take the\nradiologists 1-7 days to produce their report. Obvs, this is the scan I am most concerned\nabout as all the other problems (including the metastasis to brain) stem from my ovaries\n(or, more likely, my fallopian tubes). So this scan will include my abdominal, pelvic and\nchest area, to assess recurrence and/or progression of my disease (which is likely, in my\nview, from general trend of my disease over past 3+ years; increase over two months in\nCA-125 marker; Dr. Beavis' statement that \"this cancer is not going away;\" under 20%\nsuccess rate [i.e. stabilizing the cancer or making it regress] of my current chemo\ncombo, one of an increasingly small number of ones still available to me). The CT-scan\nwill also indicate any metastasis of cancer to, for example, chest/lungs, stomach, liver\n(on which there are a number of as yet benign exterior nodes), kidneys; assess current\npresence of cancer in lymph nodes (have they widened, remained the same or\ndecreased in width?) and tissue; detect any new masses; assess size of tumors sitting\natop the vagina, causing discomfort. Not much to see in my reproductive system as\nthere is currently scant trace of it (exterior parts and a few interior ones still remain,\nthankfully!); fortunately I put this 'system' to good use before my cancer.\nThat paragraph was pretty dense. Hope you could wade through it.\nSo this scan is all important. And I begin with it in this blog post to put the better news\ninto perspective. Please note, too, that I'll be sending the results of all three scans to\nboth gyn-oncs at Hopkins and Sloan-Kettering for their radiologists to review. I've noticed\nin the past that there are often slight discrepancies between and among the reports, but\nusually the overall impression is similar.\nMy full body bone scan, conducted to assess whether my cancer has metastasized into\nmy bones after I complained about lower back pain, shows \"no osteoblastic lesion.\" For\nthose not in the know (including myself), 'osteoblastic' has to do with increased bone\nproduction due to tumor signals to bone. It results in thickened, inflexible bone being\nformed. From this and other indications in the report, I take it to mean \"no bone cancer.\"\nYes, this is good news. It is also news that, deep down, I expected to hear; we\nproceeded with this scan out of an abundance of caution. I note, too, at the same time,\nthat I'm ill-equipped to read/interpret physicians' reports and their technical writing,\ngenerally, although out of necessity I've gotten better at it. My eyes start to glaze over\nas soon as I hit the technical vocabulary (which essentially comprises the near-entirety\nof the writings). My friend David Rothman, a poet, somehow seemed to master reading\nand parsing these materials; David, how did you do it?? \nI had to run the next-described report past my brother and son to get their take on it.\n                    \nMy brain MRI reveals \"Postsurgical changes [...] without evidence of recurrent or\nmetastatic disease.\" I take this to mean, and my brother does too, that there is no\nevidence of a recurrence of cancer in my brain or new (or old) mets in my brain. I was\nslightly confused by a 'diagnosis' of 'secondary malignant neoplasm of brain' but this\nappears to describe my original diagnosis, not a new one.\nNo evidence of metastasis to either bones or brain (including recurrence) is good news\nindeed (once again, this does not mean no mets to other organs tb-scanned this coming\nweek). It *may* also mean - and this is what I would be most encouraged by -- that I *not\nineligible* for consideration for a clinical trial somewhere (hopefully, Sloan or Hopkins).\nHowever, as noted, I will need to verify whether other metastases, should they be\nrevealed by this Tuesday's scan, would likewise render me ineligible  for a clinical trial.\nPresumably, being treated for two forms of cancer would make me even more vulnerable\nhealth-wise and a less 'attractive' candidate for a clinical trial. If the trial 'worked,' for\nexample, it might be difficult to assess which form of cancer (if I had two or more) the\ntrial was treating successfully. I may not completely understand all the reasons for my\n'ineligibility' in case of metastasis, but I'm sure they are valid. For now, one day at a\ntime. I will meet with my neuro-onc's PA, Angie Klein, on Wednesday, to review the MRI\nresults.\nIn any event, the positive-seeming report on the MRI gave me such an energy boost that\nI jumped into my car after just a short post-chemo rest and took my favorite drive to the\nantique store where I'm a regular, the Beaten Path, where I bought a pretty Deco pin (a\nblingy rhinestone bar with a large, faux aquamarine pendant hanging from it) and some\nvintage greeting cards to use for upcoming occasions, then out into the countryside,\nwhere fall is a-coming judging by the pumpkins (!) for sale at the roadside stand on Rte\n45 where I usually stop (I bought two mini-pumpkins packed with wildflowers that I will\ngive as gifts). Have also seen gourds and mums emerging at Tait Farm and elsewhere.\nTime to change my decorating scheme! Final stop: an Amish farm I didn't know; a little\nboy with one suspender on, one dangling (cute) sold me some fine-looking brown eggs.\nThis past week was largely dominated by medical stuff, as part of this coming one will\nbe, and it was stressful and very tiring. On Monday I had four medical appointments: a\ntwo-hour magnesium infusion as my level is still quite low and seems to remain that way.\nAt 1:00 p.m., immediately following the infusion, I met, for the first time, a palliative care\nDr., Nicki Vithalani, who is in State College once a week and the rest of the week at the\nLewistown (?) hospital. This meeting was very useful for me. Not only does she deal with\npain management in serious illness (fortunately, not really an issue for me now, although\nshe did give me a script for Trazadone for insomnia, which last night proved of no use\nwhatsoever), but she also helps patients navigate end of life care issues in general. She\nassured me that, when needed (and even beginning now just to get the lay of the land),\nshe would connect me with a social worker (the Geisinger office is trying to hire one),\n                    \nwho in turn could hook me up with home health aides, agencies etc. (*good ones,* I\nspecified). This left me feeling less overwhelmed by the process of investigating all this\non my own, then interviewing potential aides etc. I do need to see what my PSU-\nsponsored insurance will cover. Nicki also gave me a DNR order to fill out and put on my\nfridge. I told her that I wanted to die at home, as most people do. She also seemed to\nfunction as the token 'friendly person' on my team, the one who compliments me on my\ndress and my Skechers (!), asks me in detail about what I taught, if I am an extrovert\netc. Similarly, my relationship with my palliative care doc at Hopkins seemed to revolve\nlargely around tiramisu (!) and a similar 'holistic' approach to the patient as a *person*\n(did Nicki really care that much about my Skechers (which she contrasted with her beat-\nup slip-ons from Target) or was she just trying to be friendly? And I did think I looked\npretty cute in that new shirt dress from Paris, which I insisted on wearing to chemo even\nmost folks are there in their sweats, letting it all hang out including their bald heads!).\nSmarminess aside, it was great to meet Dr. Vithalani and we'll connect again in a few\nweeks by video chat. Glad to have her on my care team.\nAt 3 p.m. (following a short rest at home), I happened to have my yearly eye exam,\nwhich was useful as I've been having some problems with close-up vision (e.g. reading)\nwith my relatively new lenses/glasses. Indeed, Dr. Nelson (a nice, youngish woman fairly\nnew to my practice w/whom I 'click' well) tweaked my prescription slightly (my eyesight\nis actually improving, as can happen in more 'mature' age) and also gave me a script for\nreading glasses if needed.\nHome again for another rest (by this point I was fairly beat). Had a bite, then proceeded\nto hospital for my MRI (at 7:45 p.m.). Somehow, I thought it was going to take 15 mn.\nbut it wounded up lasting an hour: I moved slightly when I became anxious, and some of\nthe images needed to be reshot. So after an hour of the sound of jackhammering around\nmy head, I waited another 20 minutes or so to obtain discs containing the images (to\nsend/bring/upload for the Sloan and Hopkins oncologists/radiologists to review). By this\npoint (almost 9 p.m.), the hospital seemed empty and eerie. Compounded by my wealth\nof bad memories of the place from Ben's birth on, being there drained me. I watched t.v.\nto unwind when I returned home, then fell asleep immediately (unusual for me!).\nTuesday, I had my full-body bone scan at Geisinger Gray's Woods (a much brighter,\ncleaner-seeming place than the hospital). I drove there for 9:45 to have an injection of\nsome sort of dye, then returned at 2:30 for the scan itself (this also took about an hour,\nbut remaining completely immobilized for that duration was not necessary, as we took\nbreaks between shots). The technician, Eric, was pleasant. Nothing else is indicated in\nmy datebook for Tuesday. As I recall, it was one of two days that week during which I felt\nreally rotten, and spent much time on my couch sleeping, resting, or watching a bit of\nt.v., maybe a little reading. Again, I felt completely drained, and actually convinced\nmyself I was going to die soon.\n                    \nWednesday, I rallied enough to have lunch with two of my former colleagues who are\nnow (and always were!) friends, Kathryn and Monique. We ate outside at Duffy's Tavern\nin Boalsburg on a lovely day and had a most pleasant time. Later, Abbye, a kind and\nefficient woman a bit younger than me who helps me out with errands and tasks around\nmy house once or twice a week, came by to deliver my groceries, tidy specific areas of\nmy house, take out my trash etc. It's a help, and I could use even more of it. I normally\ndon't have the energy to do some of the intensive downsizing and straightening that I\nneed to do. Also, I'm acquisitive (if you haven't noticed...). My new policy is to give away\n(often to St. Vincent's thrift shop) one item for every one I acquire. In any event, on\nWednesday I also think I rested most of the day. I felt stressed about my MRI results,\nwhich I was awaiting.\nThursday, I had my weekly labs (I've hit it off with one of the phlebotomists, Patty; she\nhas a son who works virtually from exotic places like Bali [he's recently been in France\nfor quite a while] while his husband remains in NY. Scratch the surface of some of these\ncentral PA exteriors and you will often find wonderful, interesting people!). After resting\nsome more (really seemed to need it last week, and let myself get all the rest I need,\n'cos it helps), I met my friend (and eons ago, former student) Ted at Voodoo Brewing Co.,\na hip brewery set outside on a charming creek, featuring pub food++ as it's made with\nthe delicious seafood from Maine Bay & Berry, which the owners bring back from Maine\nweekly to their shop above the brewery. Store + brewery is a winning combo, and the\nplace is always packed. We had fun catching up (Ted works in biotech and introduced me\nto some interesting innovations in cancer research; his sis is also an OC survivor as I am)\nand took a few pics.\nBack to Friday, which was chemo day plus magnesium infusion. I wound up in the chair\nfor 4.5 hours. Thank you, as always, to Janis and Jackie for providing rides; Jackie was\neven kind enough to bring me an iced cappuccino from Caf\u00e9 Lemont as I was going to\nmiss their closing time.  However, as mentioned earlier, I received the positive-sounding\nnews on the MRI that day, and shot off into the countryside to process it in the late\nafternoon...\nRandom note: I have a small host of side effects that I try not to focus on because they\nare manageable. They include, for example, neuropathy (loss of sensation from nerve\ndamage) in my feet and lower legs). This does not prevent me from walking at all, but I\nneed to be careful about balance or getting up too quickly, as I broke a bone in my ankle\nthis way two years ago. I got up too quickly after sitting for along time and went crashing\nonto the floor as I had essentially lost feeling in my feet/legs. Another effect I have\nnoticed affects, strangely, my voice. I used to have a lovely singing and speaking voice.\nNow I notice a markedly less lovely singing voice and a bit of 'vocal fry' and odd\nmonotone quality to my voice. No one has mentioned this to me, so I may be overly-\nconscious of it, but it's annoying! But again, in the scheme of things... Avastin, finally,\nseems to stimulate my mucous membranes. Lots of sneezing of mucous, some blood.\n                    \nLovely, I know. But still, I try not to 'sweat the small stuff.' LOL.\nRandom stuff: I think my 'roller coaster' metaphor is getting tired. Yes, my life is filled\nwith 'ups and downs' (e.g. \"I'm about to die,\" \"I could live much longer than expected\"),\nanticipation, uncertainty, fear, very occasional moments of exhilaration. But usually the\nfight seems more 'cosmic' (yes, a time-worn image as well...). Mythic? Biblical? Daniel in\nthe lions' den? Jacob wrestling with the angel? Struggles beyond time and space, at time\nbeyond meaning (yet also shot through with meaning). Many differences here too (not\nsure if the divine intervention stuff applies to my story as well), but I may ditch the carny-\nride metaphor for something more appropriate-seeming.\nSpeaking of epic combats, all hail Queen Serena (my eyes are starting to tear as I'm\nwriting - this will be transition number III to follow) for embodying grace, grit,\ndetermination, confidence and much more to so many. The Queen staved off six match\npoints and brought her opponent to deuce eight times. This Queen was not going down\nwithout a fight! This Queen was leaving it all on the court! What an inspiration.\nSpeaking of metaphors (or similes) --  transition number II is here, wait for it! -- driving to\nbrunch today at the Naked Egg Cafe (lovely meal outside, solo) - I was contemplating\npacking up some additional boxes of my French-related books (books in French/about\nFrance and Francophone world) to see if one or two of my colleagues could bring them to\nschool to donate/sell to anyone who wants them. Next thought: but I'm not parting with\n*anything* from or about the 19th century, especially those paperbacks of my favorite\npoetry, purchased over the years (high school? college? grad school?). Then, lines from\nmy favorite poet, Baudelaire, popped into my mind *from memory:*\nJe t'adore \u00e0 l'\u00e9gal de la vo\u00fbte nocturne,\nO vase de tristesse,  \u00f4 grande taciturne\nEt t'aime d'autant plus, belle, que tu me fuis\nEt que tu me parais, ornement de mes nuits,\nPlus ironiquement accumuler les lieues\nQui s\u00e9parent mes bras des immensit\u00e9s bleues.\nhttps://fleursdumal.org/poem/121 [for the translation]\nSwoon.\nNext thoughts were about the gorgeousness (and macabreness, as the verses advance)\n                    \nof this poem, and reminded me of the joy it brought me, when I was younger, to\nread/study/discuss it. It made me nostalgic for those days of dissecting literature (before\nI moved more fully into history and art history). Why does the poet spell out the simile (I\nbelieve it's a simile and not a metaphor, here?) so explicitly in the first line (\u00e0 l'\u00e9gal de)?\nWhat about the interesting use of 'ironiquement' in line 5, likely signaling a host of\n'ironies' in the lover's comportment towards the poet (she 'accumulates' 'spaces' - such a\nvague word - that, ironically, serve not to bring the couple closer but to drive them apart,\na 'separation' upon which, bien s\u00fbr, the poet's attraction is based). A classic case of 'hard\nto get,' but whoever used words to paint it more gorgeously? So...I actually started\n*tearing up* in my car, both surprised that these verses are permanently ingrained in my\nmind (even post-brain surgery!) and longing for those halcyon days (ht to Michael, with\nwhom, just about an hour ago, I was discussing the demerits of a sleep aid we used to\nrely on, Halcyon!) of wonderful, creative, and intense group discussions of literature, my\nfirst academic love.\nSo speaking of eyes welling with tears (transition III!), I was driving home about 6 p.m.\non Thursday and stopped at a long light on the corner of College and Allen, where\ncampus intersects town in front of the main gates to campus, traversing which one\narrives at the majestic elm-lined mall that leads uphill to the library, office and classroom\nbuildings. Town and campus were buzzing on this beautiful early evening: long lines at\nbars as students likely sought out big screens on which to catch the first football game of\nthe year, at Purdue; students heading home after class and faculty and staff from work,\ntoo. Penn State students dressed like, well, Penn State students: PSU logo gear,\nbackpacks, sweats and gym wear, young women in crop tops and short shorts. I miss the\nbuzz, being in the mix. I miss the many opportunities for creativity and hope that I'm still\nusing my creativity in other ways, even on a reduced - or different - scale. I miss\nteaching and my colleagues. Cue the tears. I seem to do some of my best crying in the\ncar!\nIt's a relaxing holiday weekend. I hope to have lunch with my friends Maria, Mar and Jessi\ntomorrow or Monday. May start cooking for the holidays; it takes a lot of time and\nenergy. *Might* go to NY next Friday; feel that I need a change of scene. Meanwhile,\nnext week: CT-scan, labs, magnesium infusion, therapist appointment, meeting with\nneuro-onc's PA to review MRI results, but no chemo! Will likely have more clarity on the\npath forward by the end of next week.\nHopefully, more writing, reading. Watched the movie adaptation of _Brooklyn,_ as I had\njust read Colm Toibin's marvelous novel of the same name (sorry, I don't know how to\nadd the accents in Gaelic).  Saorsie Ronin delivered a good performance, but I don't\nrecommend the movie. A final section including a happy ending was added, whereas in\nthe novel the 'what happens next?' is much more ambiguous. Also just ordered a\nHolocaust themed novel recommended by a friend, _La Carte postale_ by Anne Berest. It\nwon several literary prizes. Am always looking out for excellent works of fiction, film and\n                    \nnon-fiction on the French experience of the Holocaust.\nI am still catching up on emails and texts!\nPhotos",

You are so gifted.\nI came to understand those technical terms simply by looking up every single word I\ndidn\u2019t understand, then looking up the words in the definitions I didn\u2019t understand, and\nso on, until the serious research pieces began to make sense. A bit like learning a\nlanguage.\nOn this clinical trials \u2014 my understanding is that they generally don\u2019t want subjects\nwhose disease is actively advancing because it makes results that much more difficult to\nanalyze.\nOn film \u2014 I recently saw a wonderful French film by Luc Besson. Yes, many of the films\nfor which he is most well-known are slick thrillers, but \u201cAngela,\u201d from around 2005, is\nabsolutely not that. There is nothing more violent than threats and punches (thrown by a\nbeautiful angel). It must have been some kind of passion project. Filmed in black and\nwhite and explicitly based on Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d it is funny, sentimental and\ncharming.\nThinking of you.\n                    \n  \u2014David Rothman, September 4, 2022  \nDear Willa, I am heartened by how successfully you are meeting all the challenges put in\nyour way. They will continue and so will you, dear, passionate, vibrant, life-affirming\nniece. You seem to be able to want to absorb everything. One upcoming program you\nmay already have on your calendar is Ken Burn's documentary on the Holocaust, Sept.\n18th-20th.\n  \u2014Marlene Green, September 4, 2022  \nThank you, dear aunt!

    "entry": "Thank you to the many of you who showed concern regarding my CT-scan.\nUnfortunately, my CT-scan was cancelled today and needed to be rescheduled. I\nreceived a call from Geisinger scheduling at about 10:30 a.m. or so, while I was lying on\nmy couch in the sunroom, in the middle of my four-hour fast (those 24-hours fasts on\nYom Kippur proved good practice...). The technician had to leave on short notice, et\nvoil\u00e0. Next available appointment at Gray's Woods: late September. So instead I\nrescheduled for this Thursday, at the Lewistown hospital. Fifty miles round trip; I have\nenough 'juice' in my 'tank' to do it, but it's a pain.\nAll this made for a stressful day. I've not been feeling great, extremely fatigued, short of\nbreath, and with a low-grade headache all day (just today). I need a lot of sleep. The\n                    \naccumulation of the chemo drugs in my body wears me down, and this particular combo\nseems to be hitting me hard. I feel so frustrated not being able to 'accomplish' or even\nmove forward with most of my normal activities. Please do remember how much fun I\nam (was?...)!

    "entry": "First, my apologies to NY pals I won't get to see in next few days, even though I miss\nyou! Feeling up to it, if still generally fatigued, I decided to take the train to the city\nyesterday for a few days to see my family. We'll be celebrating the *97th* birthday of my\nmother's partner, Arnold, a World War II veteran, and I wanted to be here for that. Lunch\nwith Ethan tomorrow, after I drop off discs of imaging plus radiologists' reports at Dr.\nCohen's office at Sloan-Kettering (still with the intent of ascertaining whether a clinical\ntrial at MKS might be in my future). Today, Ben and I are planning to take the ferry that\n'contourne' (sorry - I am writing quickly and can only think of the French word!) Brooklyn,\nmaking stops at Atlantic Avenue, Bay Ridge and other stops that I've forgotten. It's\nraining, not heavily right now, and this trip by water is something of a bucket list item for\nme. Had we taken it twenty-one years plus one day ago, the Towers would have loomed\nabove us. It seems an appropriate gesture of homage and mourning today. I have many\nthoughts about the enduring - and the transitory - meaning(s) of 911, and how they have\nmorphed over the past twenty-one years, but don't have time to write about that now.\nMemories seared into our hearts and minds forever, as is the one of six-year-old Ben\nasking whether there were children on those planes.\nA brief preliminary update on the radiologists' report on my CT scan. As expected, my\ndisease has progressed in my pelvic/abdominal/chest area; that is the overall\n\"impression\" of the radiologists ('impression' in the report refers to their overall findings).\nThe report had arrived in my Geisinger portal when I woke up yesterday and as I was\nrushing to drive to the train depot (the oldest in PA, from 1849!) I was only able to read it\nonce. I expect to have Drs. Patel, Beavis, and perhaps Cohen interpret it further for me\nthis week. Its language is technical and found me looking up words I did not understand;\nI need to have the doctors put it all in laywomen's terms for me. Some lymph nodes have\n                    \nincreased in size, one or two have decreased. I don't believe I read the word 'metastasis,'\nbut I would need to read it again. Pancreas is clear. There are nodes on the exterior of\nmy liver; up to this point, these have likely been benign. I don't know if anything has\nchanged. The area scanned still reveals masses (which I'm pretty sure I can feel). The\nreport contains additional revelations but I have put it aside for now, and probably won't\nlook at it again until I speak with my doctors. There's not much more I can do for now; so\nI'll just enjoy my time in NY.\nI was expecting the news, but it's certainly not pleasant to read. So many emotions:\nanger, sadness, gratitude - at least for now. Why am I only entitled to 82.8% of a\nlife(span)? I could have accomplished so much in the remaining 17.2%... I'll write about\nmy notion of 2/3 of a life some other time.\nImmense gratitude to my friend Lisa Sternlieb for accompanying me to Lewistown\nhospital last Thursday for my CT-scan, keeping me laughing with her stories and our\ngabbing while I worked my way through two large bottles of a barium drink\n(yummmm......not), indulging my craving for French fries from McDo after the scan and\nthe fast that preceded it, and taking time off from her busy teaching/school schedule. It\nwas wonderful to spend time with Lisa. I only felt moderately (re)traumatized by\nrevisiting Lewistown Hospital, site of my ill-fated trip in Jan. 2022 (for which I have\nMartina Kolb to thank - not for the trip being ill-fated but for her strength during it, and\nher kindness). What was to be a visit for a simple MRI that frigid day wound up with my\nlanding in the ER in Lewistown, and then being life-flighted to Hopkins, as I watched\nMartina become a tiny dot waving goodbye from the roof of the hospital as the helicopter\ntook off.\nGabe and Yvonne, you were in my dream last night. I think about you fondly, and often,\nand hope I'll be able to write you a catch-up email before long... I hope you are both well.\nI must run now to have a bite and then Uber down to \"Corlears Hook\" (which I never\nknew existed) to meet Ben for our Brooklyn ferry adventure. Feeling quite\nWhitmanesque...\nFeel free to DM or text me. More news when I have it.",

    "entry": "A brief update between a visit to family in New York (fun, if a bit arduous physically, but\nmore on that in another posting), from which I returned yesterday, and a drive tomorrow\nto Maryland, for a telemedicine appointment with Dr. Beavis.\nThere have been many, many twists and turns over the past few days as I try to share\ninformation with three oncologists, figure out the optimal order of meetings, and of\ncourse arrive at decisions regarding the best path forward. I'm picturing myself making\narrangements with Dr. Beavis' nurse while on the train home from NY yesterday (I try to\nspeak as softly as possible, unlike the remarkable number of folks gabbing at full volume\ninto their phones, often for hours; this actually led me to a semi-altercation with a\nwoman on the train, but I'll skip that story for now); and conversing with Dr. Cohen's\nnurse twice, once while a)sitting in the big comfy chair in the infusion room (I got 'stuck'\nin the chair and couldn't figure out how to climb down, tethered to my port, to retrieve a\npen so I could take notes) and b)while driving around the Amish farms, necessitating a\nstop in the long driveway of one of them so the nurse and I could discuss clinical trials.\nHope you could wade through that sentence, dense as a thicket.\nThe sheer chaotic pace of the past few days called to mind Jacques Brel's wonderful song\n\"La Valse \u00e0 mille temps\" (\"Carousel\"), with its steadily quickening, dizzying pace:\n\"We're on a carousel\nA crazy carousel\nAnd now we go around\nAgain we go around\nAnd now we spin around\nWe're high above the ground\nAnd down again around\nAnd up again around\nSo high above the ground\nWe feel we've got to yell\nWe're on a carousel\nA crazy carousel\"\nI was on a bit of Brel kick yesterday as I listened to him singing \"Le Moribond\"\n(improbably translated into English as \"Seasons in the Sun,\" which many of us 'of a\ncertain age' remember):\n                    \n\"Carousel:\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4tMl9_fWi8\nBrel singing \"Le Moribond\" (\"The Dying\nMan\"): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzmbZUO7rU8\nI'll avoid the byzantine minutia of the past few days and provide a summary: a)\ntomorrow I am driving to Maryland for a telemedicine appointment with Dr. Beavis. As\nshe can no longer 'practice' (including virtually) in states other than MD, I must be\n*inside the MD border* to meet with her! This requirement of being in the state where\nthe physician practices was suspended during the height of COVID when people were not\ntravelling (and sometimes not even leaving their homes), but is back in place now. We\nwill review the results of my latest CT-scan and discuss the path forward. I had\nconsidered various options for tomorrow such as renting a coworking space for my visit\nwith her or even hitting a coffee shop, but decided to opt for privacy, comfort and\npresumably a good internet connection...at a suites' hotel in Hagerstown, MD (!). I'll pick\nup dinner on the way down from Alvaro's in Harrisburg, then hunker down tomorrow\nnight to watch the premiere of \"The Great British Baking Show\" and/or to read and/or\nwrite and/or take a dip in the pool. My appointment's at 4 and I'll return Saturday\nmorning; b)in order to meet with Dr. Beavis, I cancelled my Friday morning meeting with\nDr. Patel, followed by chemo. For the moment, the current chemo regimen is off\n(although it, or another chemo regimen, may eventually be back on). Any chemo I get at\nthis point will have a very low success rate because I've exhausted so many of the\nconventional lines of treatment); c)the possibility of a clinical trial at MSK is part of the\npuzzle. Dr. Beavis asked me to reach out again to Dr. Cohen to get his input, so I did. His\nnurse called me today to tell me that there are two trials that are, as we agreed,\n\"potentially possible.\" That call raised my spirits significantly. Then she called me again a\nfew hours later to tell me that, after thoroughly reviewing all my information and the fine\nprint of the clinical trial description, I am only potentially eligible for *one* of the trials.\nLearning that the number of trials 'potentially possible' for me had just diminished by\n50%, I felt significantly less buoyant (but still a bit puffed up -- see title of this blog, with\nthanks to Jane Mallison for the Latin proverb!). Even if Dr. Beavis agreed that this trial\nrepresented the best path forward, I would still need to go through several tests at MSK\nto confirm or deny my eligibility. The MSK nurse sent me the descriptions of the trial\nfrom Clinicaltrials.gov. Of course these files were way too big to send to Dr. B through\nthe portal, so I am hoping that she will be able to locate their descriptions on her own\n(she is likely familiar with them). d)I will gather information tomorrow and share with Drs.\nPatel and Cohen on Monday. Oy!\nToday I had a magnesium infusion, after which I took a lovely drive in the country. Yes, I\nbought lots of gourds (pls see cartoon - guilty of #3 as charged!). The leaves are starting\nto turn. I also bought an acorn squash that I'm cooking now, fresh brown eggs, and a\nhuge, gnarly pumpkin. It was a beautiful day here.\n                    \nSome of my classmates are enjoying a lovely class reunion in Rome as I write, complete\nwith a black tie dinner at the Villa Borghese. I would have loved to have hopped on a\nplane, bought or brought a few cute dresses, eaten an incredible pizza, and cried over\nbeautiful art in one of my favorite cities. But as I often tell myself, \"this is what we're\ndoing right now.\"\nPhotos",

    "entry": "It's easy for my mind to play tricks on me and embrace the worst case scenario,\ntriggered by certain key words in radiologists' reports and my oncologists' interpretation\nof them. So I apologize if I gave the impression that I was at death's door, and hope that\nI'm not turning into the girl who cried wolf. \n\"Your time is limited,\" per Dr. Beavis, verbatim. No surprise there. But nothing is\nimminent and no one is discussing stopping treatment. And maybe there's a magic bullet\nout there, somewhere. Who knows.\nI've been caught up in a whirlwind the past ten days - I'm on the 'crazy carousel.' After\nreturning from NY on Wednesday, Dr. Beavis and I determined that we would have a\ntelemedicine appointment on Friday at 4:00 p.m. to discuss my recent scans and next\nsteps. She (and all doctors, I believe) can no longer benefit from the Covid loophole that\nallowed them to practice medicine virtually across state lines. As a result, I was obliged\nto cross the border into Maryland to telemeet with her (thank goodness it wasn't Boston,\nor Houston). I had to, in a quick day's time a)find a logical Maryland location for me to\nland (I chose Hagerstown) b)unpack and repack (I was so short on time this consisted of\nmy dumping everything out of my suitcase onto my bed and putting a few items back);\nc)try to rest and ready myself for the next trip. I enjoyed the September mellowness on\nmy drive down, with a pit stop at Alvaro's in Harrisburg for lunch (excellent pizza, also\npicked up pasta/eggplant parmigiana for dinner plus a few lemon ricotta cookies for the\nroad). Arrived at the hotel about 2:30, a ratty Radisson (something that sounded like\ncartoons blaring from the room next door; shoddy internet made me panic but the front\ndesk somehow managed to improve the connection shortly before I was to meet with Dr.\nBeavis). Oh well. It was a good enough place for me to land for an overnight.\nI spoke to Dr. Beavis for about an hour. Without going into too much detail, she\nrecommends prioritizing the clinical trial at MSK about which I've been in touch with Dr.\nCohen. She feels it's probably a good time for me to have a prolonged break from\nchemo: the neuropathy that is one of chemo's side effects will only worsen, she warned,\nand has already morphed into a bothersome case of 'restless leg(s),\" which sometimes\nkeeps me awake. My body has absorbed a lot of chemo over the past three+ years. In\nmy understanding, clinical trials at the top cancer centers often subsequently set the\nstandard for care; Dr. Beavis feels that now's the time for me to try a more 'investigative'\noption such as a trial. The trial itself involves immunotherapy and another substance (an\nantibody?); it is not chemo. One of the 'substances' is now marketed as Keytruda\n(perhaps you've seen ads for it on t.v.), but is not yet used to treat advanced uterine and\novarian cancer, nor is it used in combo with another substance.\nMy admission to the trial is definitely not a done deal, however. Dr. Beavis raised two\nconcerns about my eligibility. I have, this morning, queried MSK about these. Further, I\n                    \nwould/will need to return to NY for screening tests to assess my eligibility. For now, then,\nI'm not sharing further details about the trial itself as they are moot.\nIf the MSK option falls through - which I hope it doesn't - Dr. Beavis next proposed a\nclinical trial at Hopkins (not yet tested on humans...!); she'll have the research team\nreach out to discuss the trial with me. The third option, per Dr. Beavis, would be another\nline of chemo, retaining Avastin and adding a drug other than Taxol. That 'back pocket'\ncontaining the remaining chemo options will soon become tiny, although she and Dr.\nPatel are not ready to give those up yet, especially as a few of my lymph nodes\ndecreased in size from the last scan.\nVoil\u00e0. The plan sounds reasonable to me and I will pluck up my courage and energy for\nthe next round, whatever it may be. Schedule, whereabouts, travel etc. all up in the air\nright now. If you're a listmaker, an organizer, a detailed planner, a schedule junkie (all of\nwhich I am), you'll watch it all go out the window when you undergo cancer treatment.\nWhich is not always a bad thing.\nMy CT scan, for which the Hopkins radiologists produced a much more detailed report\nthan Geisinger's and which Dr. Beavis herself analyzed closely in comparison with my\nearlier scans, shows, per Beavis, a \"slight increase\" in tumor and lymph node size. I was\nrelieved to learn that the progression of my disease has not been radical. Further, no\nmetastases were detected. And, since she didn't mention these, I presume that the\nnodes on my liver's exterior are benign. Yes, it could be worse.\nOh, I forgot that she's put in an order for another scan that will detect whether I have a\nclot in my lungs (which she considers doubtful) and she'll speak to Dr. Patel about\nordering another type of scan of my heart. This is because she finds my shortness of\nbreath somewhat surprising, given that in her view my red blood cell count is not all that\nlow. My breathlessness may simply be attributed to 'deconditioning' - must try to get in\nthose steps, pushing through the discomfort. I'm glad she's being thorough.\nSo it seems I have a break from chemo for a while.  In any event, I'll need to have a\n'wash' (ie let the current chemo wash out of my system) before starting in on the next\nthing. Hopefully I'll feel better as a result. And I plan to have a cocktail!\nI was grateful for my convo with Dr. B. yet afterwards (perhaps understandably) felt\nadrift, alone, drained and out of sorts. The hotel was in some sort of very spread out\noffice park cum mall so there was really nowhere to walk. I wound up having my dinner a\nwhile later and then reading in this somewhat sinister looking room. The hotel didn't\ncarry Netflix so my plan to watch \"The Great British Baking Show\" was foiled, but I\nenjoyed it when I returned home the next day.\nRealizing I was in close proximity to several Civil War battlefields, the next day -\n                    \nSeptember 17th - I decided to learn some American history on the way back to State\nCollege. My mother told me that the 17th was the 160th anniversary *date* of the Battle\nof Antietam, the 'bloodiest day in American history' due to its astounding death toll of\n23.000 that day -- boys and men from Pennsylvania, Ohio, Vermont, Texas, Louisiana\netc., under the command of Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and other generals. The\nanniversary apparently drew even larger crowds than usual to the 3.000 acre site in\nSharpsburg, MD, strewn with monuments and markers of all types, and special activities\nwere taking place (I jumped every time I heard the loud boom from the artillery\ndemonstrations). I took a self-guided tour in my car that comprised eleven different\npoints of importance regarding the battle -- the Dunker church where wounded were\ntaken, the peaceful cornfield that became, on that day, a killing field. I could go on and\non about what I learned and how glad I was to have made the detour. The crowd itself --\nCivil War history buffs, scout troops, Confederate nostalgists, reenactors, families, others\n-- piqued my curiosity. And ringing the battlefield, modest homes in small-town rural\nMaryland, many of them boasting American flags and pro-Trump signs. Hadn't Lincoln,\nwho three months after Antietam issued the Emancipation Proclamation, quoted from\nthe Book of Matthew when he was chosen to run for Senate in 1858 as the Republican\ncandidate, declaring that \"a house divided against itself shall not stand?\"\nHistory's a palimpsest, isn't it? And just as we need to study the past to learn about the\npresent, we need to observe the present to learn about the past. This notion struck me\nagain while watching the first part of Ken Burns' excellent documentary about America\nand the Holocaust last night. Antietam certainly took my mind off cancer, and I'd love to\ntalk more about it with anyone interested.\nSo looking forward to my girlhood friend (and then college classmate), Kay, arriving\ntomorrow for a visit (lots of gabbing in store), followed by my mother's arrival, as each\nyear at this time and laden down with a round challah, to help celebrate the new year.\nMy phone is quite full and I need to pare down the amount of stuff on it before I post\nmore pictures...\nBe well, everyone.",

    "entry": "Health-wise, this has been a deflating week. Yesterday, I found out that, in the end, I'm\nineligible for the clinical trial that I had very much hoped to be part of at Sloan-Kettering.\nI had an appointment scheduled for next Thursday, to undergo screening tests, with the\ntherapy itself slated to begin on October 6th. I was eager to try immunotherapy as an\nalternative to chemo, as I have heard promising things and my body has absorbed so\nmuch chemo, which can be debilitating. An ancillary advantage would have been\nproximity to my great support system in NY. Dr. Cohen called me yesterday while I was\nwaiting to have a magnesium infusion here in State College to let me know that, after\nhaving re-reviewed all my materials, he determined that I've had too many lines of\nchemo to be eligible for the trial. I'm not sure precisely why that is the case, but I was\nfeeling too stunned to query him about it. Further, I was mortified to learn that he had\ncalled me about a week earlier to share this news with him, but I only infrequently check\nmy voicemails (lesson learned...) as I'm much more accustomed to receiving written\ncommunications from my physicians through online portals, which I check every day. Dr.\nCohen acknowledged that the news was \"extremely disappointing\" and said that he'd\ndefinitely let me know if he becomes aware of any other trials for which I'd be eligible.\nSo yesterday was a deflating day -- I went practically straight from the infusion room to\nGray's Woods for a scan of my lungs, to assess whether a blood clot might be the cause\nof my shortness of breath (it's not - yay). Then I simply let myself relax for the rest of the\nday; I thought about taking a drive in the beautiful early fall weather, but felt too tired so\nheaded home to enjoy the prettiness out my sunroom window while relaxing wrapped up\nin a pashmina shawl on my cozy couch.\nI will need to regroup and, with Dr. Beavis' help, figure out the best plan B. I've written\nher already with the disappointing news from MSK. As I wrote in my previous post, I\nbelieve, with her usual foresight she had already laid out options B (clinical trial at\nHopkins, about which I know nothing at this point) and C (another line of chemo, which I\ndiscussed with Dr. Patel this past week, but in which neither of us places enormous hope\nfor marked success, ie stabilizing or reducing the size of my tumors/cancer burden). \nI will also look into, more seriously than I had when I thought MSK was a go, potential\noptions further afield geographically, especially at M.D. Anderson in Houston and at\nUCLA, where I have contacts and where I have already initiated inquiries. Whether I'd\neven fly to one of these places to meet with a gyn-onc will depend, of course, on whether\nthey are running trials for which I might be considered (not a given, by any means). And I\ndon't do well emotionally and mentally without a strong support system accessible,\nespecially when taking into account a presumably limited lifespan.\nSo these will be the next steps. But first the holiday -- my mother arrives shortly, as\nevery year in recent memory, to observe and enjoy the new year with me (and, at\n                    \nservices, my congregation).\nFortunately, the week, which ended with a thud, began with an uplift! My girlhood friend\nKay came to visit for three days, after having kindly proposed the visit (she lives in SoCal\nbut happened to be spending some time on the east coast). We met when we were\ntwelve, in Amherst, MA (where my father was teaching summer school) in a local\nproduction of a musical version of _Tom Sawyer._ Our friendship continued on and,\ncoincidentally, we both wound up at Harvard, even living in the same dorm our freshman\nyear.  We've maintained our friendship, but it had become slightly perfunctory, with\nheartfelt phone calls, then emails, but only once or twice a year. Thankfully, we had the\nchance this time to renew our friendship and 'dig deep' through hours of talking,\nreminiscing, and setting off on fun outings in search of vintage jewelry and the perfect\ncocktail. I'm just sorry that this reconnection didn't happen sooner, but better late than\nnever. We have so much in common! After college, we both eventually obtained our\ndoctorates and pursued careers in academia (Kay in English at UC Santa Barbara); we've\nboth recently retired. We're both daughters of academics, too, with one son each (mine's\n27, Kay's is 28), both of whom are data scientists after obtaining their M.S.s in that field.\nWe're both Jewish. And our temperaments mesh well. Kay is *in part* ever the creative,\nimaginative, witty, ironic, literate, smart lover of performativity -- and, accordingly,\nbrought with her 'costumes' for the two of us to wear for our day out and about in Happy\nValley. Dressed in matching Harvard t-shirts and baseball caps -- ironically, on the eve of\nthe Nittany Lions' big home game against Central Michigan -- we garnered the strangest\nlooks and comments (which of course was the point). Thank you, dear Kay, for your visit.\nRunning out of time here. Wishing everyone (should you happen to observe, especially) a\nblessed, sweet, healthy, happy and successful new year 5783, as full in its cyclicity as\nthe round challah we eat at this time and as bounteous as the seeds in the\npomegranate. L'shanah tovah!\nFood pics to follow. Somehow, somehow I've managed to cook all the holiday dishes for\nour meal tomorrow evening - chicken soup with matzah balls, tzimmes, lokshen kugel,\nhoney cake, with brisket to be cooked tonight/tomorrow.\n\"...and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.\" B.J.

    "entry": "Medical update: Up-and-down may work better than the roller coaster metaphor as a\nroller coaster ride holds the promise of being thrilling. Recent developments have not\nbeen thrilling. At all. [btw, for the discussion of 'up-and-down' v. 'roller coaster' I credit\nAmy Bloom, whose memoir, _In Love,_ I am currently reading. Bloom helped her\nhusband, Brian, take his life in Zurich under the auspices of Dignitas when Brian was\ndiagnosed at 65 with Alzheimer's].\nAs I shared, Plan A, participation in a clinical trial at Sloan-Kettering, fell through at the\nlast minute when Dr. Cohen concluded that I had had too many lines of chemo to make\nme eligible for the trial. Just today, after I had let the trial nurse know that I wanted to go\nahead with a trial Dr. Beavis identified for me at Hopkins (Plan B), I found out the last slot\nin the trial had just been claimed. The nurse will let me know if the last participant is\ndeemed ineligible or if new slots open up, but when will that be? Ben convinced me to\nstop kicking myself for the delay caused by my taking a bit of time (a few days? I don't\nremember. The holiday, which I observe, also intervened) to find out about trial options\nat M.D. Anderson and UCLA, where personal contacts had directed me. M.D. Anderson,\nwhich I first contacted in July and where a physician named Dr. Milojevic had been quite\nhelpful, sent me descriptions of three trials for which I might be eligible, which I've now\nforwarded to Dr. Beavis. At UCLA, the nurse for Dr. Beth Karlan, a prominent gyn-onc\nspecializing in ovarian cancer, was extremely helpful in a long phone convo yesterday,\nexplaining much about trials and drug therapies that had remained murky for me. She\ndissuaded me from pursuing a trial at UCLA, mainly because of the distance, expense,\nsignificant time away from my support system etc. -- and the lack at this time of a really\nsuitable trial for me. Moreover, I've been feeling caught between two camps of\nfriends/family: the ones who urge me to 'leave no stone unturned' against this insidious\ndisease and the ones who understand that far from my support system I don't fare well,\nespecially knowing that time may be limited. Hopkins, as my brother reminded me, is\nalways a safe bet as it's been my 'home away from home' since 2019 and I never falter\nin my esteem for this medical center and its world-class staff. It's never been a question\nof my trying to 'sneak behind Dr. Beavis' back,' either, but simply of looking into what's\nout there. She knows that I've been exploring what other major cancer centers might\nhave to offer me, and approves my efforts. It's simply unfortunate that my investigation\n*may* have cost me a spot in Hopkins' clinical trial (but again: no guarantee the trial\nwould have worked for me, no guarantee I would have been eligible in the end, no\nguarantee that the last trial spot was claimed precisely when I decided to move forward\nwith Hopkins and not earlier, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.).\nI await word from Dr. Beavis, but it seems we may be on to Plan C, another line of\nchemo. The hope was to give me a break from chemo, as I've had so much of it, and to\ntry an 'investigational' option at this time. If in a few months this line of chemo only\nshows limited success, as all the previous ones have, perhaps there will be an\n                    \nappropriate clinical trial available to me at that time.\nThere's still room for this revised plan to change, however. Of course I was feeling\ndisappointed today and got into bed crying after returning from lunch and learning that\nPlan B was a no-go (also forgot to take my Lexapro, which keeps me even keel). Such a\nfucking insidious disease. I'm hoping that by early next week the latest plan will be in\nplace.\nAlthough I haven't had any treatment (except magnesium infusions) the past several\nweeks of 'wash out,' I'm not feeling too badly. Abdominal discomfort, fatigue etc. not\nmarkedly worse than several weeks ago. Still getting out and about, although of course\non a somewhat more modified scale than during my pre-cancer days.\nFollowing our tradition of the past ten years or so, my mother came to State College for\nthe holiday. Somehow I managed to pull off a Rosh Hashanah feast. I began cooking\nabout two weeks before the holiday and relied on days when I was feeling more\nenergetic than others to cook or bake. On Sunday, I spent the entire day cooking,\nstraightening, and creating an eye-catching d\u00e9cor for the meal - with my mother's help\nof course. I made: chicken soup with matzah balls, lokshen kugel (w/an artery-clogging\ncombo of farmers' cheese, cottage cheese and sour cream), tzimmes (prunes, carrots,\nand sweet potato slices slow cooked for hours until they become caramelized; I added\nginger, grated orange peel, orange juice and liberal dollops of schmaltz), saut\u00e9ed\nzucchini, sweet and sour brisket with cranberries (tangy!) and for dessert, honey cake for\na sweet new year, blueberries, raspberries, and lemon sorbet. A bold Cab to drink.\nApples and four kinds of local honey. Appetizers: pickles, cheeses. The end product was\nwonderful, but I must admit it was tiring. I had to lay down every two hours or so for a\nrest. We were delighted that my friend Lisa and her daughter could enjoy the meal with\nus, abbreviated as it was, unfortunately, as my mother and I needed to leave for\nservices. \nServices resonated differently for me this year, likely for good reason. I do enjoy the\nprospect of a new year, regeneration and renewal, the pretty fall colors. But I simply\ncan't get behind the idea of God's infinite lovingkindness and protectiveness. A question\nas old as  Job, but yes: if God is these things, why would he blight me with this horrible\ndisease and all the pain and anxiety I've experienced the past few years (which is not to\nsay that the wonderful times have not outweighed the bad and that my spirit remains\nstrong and determined)? [and, incidentally, why would s/he allow - sanction? - mass\nkillings of civilisans in Ukraine?] I of course know that there are 'explanations' -- or\nrationales-- for suffering in our theology, but I just don't buy them (and I truly apologize if\nI'm offending anyone's beliefs here, but I need to be candid about my own). A spiritual\nwake-up call? An opportunity for others to appreciate their blessings in contrast to my\nsuffering? A chance to elevate my soul? An example of \"God working in mysterious\nways?\" A call to examine my own sinfulness and lack of repentance? I can't possibly\n                    \nhave been *that sinful* this past year as to merit some of the physical agony I've been\nthrough (I in fact breathed a sigh of relief during tashlich, realizing that the number of\nsins I needed to cast off into the creek in the form of bits of challah was fairly minimal\nthis year!). And I can't accept that any amount of prayer, Torah reading or tzedakah (I\nalways make donations at the new year, and this year gave to the central PA food bank)\ncan \"alleviate the harshness of God's decree.\" Sure, bits of the service, ideas, verses,\nstuck with me as always. But I don't believe in the 'God' presented to us during services,\nat least not in the conventional form...\nSo what do I believe in? I believe in the goodness in you. Call that godliness if you will.\nEvery caring email, text, phone call, card, visit, kind word, gift manifests blessing. \nShabbat Shuvah shalom! Wishes for peace and peacefulness on this special shabbat\nbetween Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "I hope I didn't come across as overly bitter in my post yesterday -- an image that's\ndistasteful to me -- nor worthy of pity - ditto. My rapidly cycling emotions in reaction to\n                    \noften quickly changing circumstances are simply part of the up-and-down.\nI did want to leave a written trace of my lovely few days in NY in mid-September, a\nfamily-focused visit.  I tried not to 'overbook' myself but rather to focus on one outing a\nday, so as not to become overtired -- not my usual NY pace, but so it goes. Ben was kind\nenough to indulge one of my bucket list wishes (although I'm not big on the whole\nbucket list idea) - a ride on the South Brooklyn ferry, the regular one that transports\nBrooklynites to and from, not any of the ferries geared towards tourists.  After a false\nstart during which we were thwarted from boarding the ferry at Corlears Hook (an\nunknown to me NY locale!) b/c of construction, we regrouped -- soggy, cranky and a bit\ntuckered out though we were after having trouble finding one another -- then Ubured to\nWall St., and boarded our ferry there, where the largest crowds were taking another ferry\nto Ikea in Red Hook. How refreshing to leave the densely-packed island for the wide,\ncalm, quiet expanses of New York harbor and the Brooklyn shore line, ending up in Bay\nRidge. As it was raining lightly (and a Sunday), we were actually the only passengers on\nthe upper level of the ferry! It was also September 11, and such a peaceful trip in the\nharbor felt appropriate; the one firehouse we passed, close to Ground Zero,  was busied\nwith a commemorative luncheon and bedecked with memorial wreaths. Such a slow-\npaced, still place, the ferry, an offshore oasis. As I was afraid my wig would blow off into\nthe harbor, I shoved it in my purse and let the wind massage my bald head!\nI had reread Whitman's \"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry\" (1856) because I love Whitman\n(describing a ferry ride from Manhattan to Brooklyn along the trajectory that was to\nbecome the Brooklyn Bridge) and knew his poem would resonate with (and aggrandize!)\nour modest outing:\n\"Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\nOthers will watch the run of the flood-tide,\nOthers will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to\nthe south and east,\nOthers will see the islands large and small;\nFifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high,\nA hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them,\n                    \nWill enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the\nebb-tide.\"\n \nAfter our return to terra firma, Ben and I Ubured to Veneiro's (by now, you may know\nthat I have a 'thing' for Italian pastries - and pastry shops, and this 1885 shop is one of\nthe best) for luscious cake (tiramisu cake for me) and cappuccino.\n \nAnother treat was to have my brother meet me at Sloan-Kettering, where I was dropping\noff discs in anticipation of moving forward with a clinical trial there, and join me for\nlunch. We headed to Rosa Mexicano, relaxed, and had a good chat. I think we may have\nmisordered as I usually enjoy whatever I get there, but it wasn't a big deal. Ethan's\nBloody Mary with Mezcal was yummy, and I had some sort of tasty mocktail. After lunch I\nheaded to Kalustyan, NY's legendary global foods store, and bought some rose harissa\n(I'm not sure why, I think it's a required ingredient in some Ottolenghi recipe I'm\ninterested in), candied citron for my Rosh Hashanah honey cake, their delicious house-\nmade labneh with a bit of apricot jam, and a tiny piece of halvah - because it's so good.\n \nI indulged in a manicure -- teal nails for Ovarian Cancer Awareness month.\n \nThe next night we enjoyed a celebratory dinner organized and offered by my mother--\none of the raisons d'\u00eatre for my visit -- for her partner, Arnold. 97 years old! A World War\nII veteran who saw combat in France and Germany (all praise and honor to him for that),\nArnold is also a volunteer tour guide with the Big Apple Greeters in New York. The food\nwas excellent and we were delighted to be together. When I asked Arnold what life\nlessons he could share with us, he said: \"Be tolerant.\" Excellent advice for the\ngenerations to come.\n                    \nPhotos",

    "entry": "Chugging along here, determinedly. Medical update: The plan is still for me to start\nreceiving a new line of chemo this Friday unless by some miracle a slot opens up in the\nPhase I trial at Hopkins that Dr. Beavis had designated as Plan B. She also encouraged\nme to schedule a consult at M.D. Anderson, a premiere cancer center in Houston, to see\nif they might have something to offer me. Of a list of three trials at M.D. Anderson that\nhad been identified to me in July by Dr. Ljiljana Milojevic, the very helpful coordinator of\nclinical research programs in gyn-onc there, at least one looked of interest to Dr. Beavis\nwhen I shared the descriptions with her. But M.D. Anderson is running lots of trials, all\nthe time, so it is possible/probably that others will be potentially available to me once I\nfinish the next line of chemo (I'm not sure when that will be; I'll need to be treated for a\nfew cycles at least, and then scanned).\nRight now I'm particularly interested in trials involving immunotherapy, which would rely\non my immune system to fight my cancer, although other newish treatments may well\nbe available to me too. Dr. Beavis seems indisposed to my receiving immunotherapy\noutside a clinical trial, due, I believe, to the prohibitive cost of the drugs (if taken in the\ncourse of a trial, though, they are free); however, I'm pushing her a bit on this, as she\ntold me that occasionally she's been able to obtain the meds for a reasonable cost\noutside of a trial. Further, as she told me, immunotherapy has not proven as effective as\noriginally hoped in treating ovarian cancer (unlike the case for blood cancer, lung\n                    \ncancer); however, she still feels that it's worthwhile for me to pursue this treatment in\nthe context of a clinical trial. I posed a series of immunotherapy-focused questions to the\nmembers of a chat group I occasionally consult, Sisterhood of Ovarian Cancer Survivors.\nSome corroborated what Dr. Beavis told me, others contradicted it. I also read conflicting\ncategorizations of Avastin, a drug I will continue taking as of this Friday. While some said\nit was an immunotherapy drug (and indeed, I've seen it described this way online),\nothers rather vehemently denied this (Steve, care to weigh in?). So consulting this\n'sisterhood' only turned out to be moderately helpful, in the end, but I gleaned a few\nuseful pieces of information.\nIn any event, my appointment at M.D. Anderson is on W Oct. 26th with Dr. Shannon\nWestin, whom I've heard good reports about. I *might* change the appointment to a\nslightly later date, as a 10/26 meeting leaves me scant time to make plans, figure out\nlogistics etc. Having the wherewithal and stamina to navigate large airports and a\nsprawling, unfamiliar medical center given my current health challenges makes me\nsomewhat anxious but if need be I'm sure I could do it, perhaps w/a bit of help in the\nairports. Road (i.e. air) trip to Houston, anyone?\nI have a bit more 'homework' to do looking into what other cancer and/or medical\ncenters (Dana-Farber, NYU Langone, Penn, Mayo) might have to offer.\nIn one tiny piece of good news for this week, because my magnesium level crept back\ninto normal range per my labwork, my two-hour infusion on Monday was cancelled! This\nmeans that, after brunch with a friend, I'll have the rest of the afternoon to spend with\nBen, who's coming for a week-long visit this afternoon and who has off for Columbus\nDay! It's the little things...\nI also had to have an echocardiogram this week, ordered by Dr. Beavis, who seemed\nconcerned by my occasional shortness of breath (from the results I received for this\nsonogram of my heart, it appears that everything's normal, but I'll wait to hear it from\nDr. B. next week). Because no appointments were available in State College, I was\nbooked at a Geisinger clinic in Philippsburg, half an hour northwest of State College. The\nfall foliage and bursts of sunshine on a largely cloudy day were dazzling as I drove to my\ndestination. Less dazzling were the many, many signs in rural Warren county (waaay\ndeep into Maga-country) instructing to 'drain the swamp' and to vote for Mastriano (who\nthreatens to charge women who have abortions with murder) as governor and Oz as\nsenator.\nThe Geisinger facility was pretty run-down, but convenient enough for a non-invasive\nprocedure. As the technician rolled a wand over, poked and prodded the left side of my\nchest, I semi-snoozed, only to awake with a start when I heard her say to me: \"You have\na little, tiny breast\" (!!). When I looked at her with some alarm and shock, she repeated\nwhat she had actually said the first time: \"Let's have a little, tiny breath.\" I told her what\n                    \nI thought she had said and we both had a hearty belly-laugh.\nSince I have not had chemo in over a month (Sept. 2 was my last infusion, I believe), I\nam actually feeling pretty well w/the drugs out of my system (I felt strong enough to fast\non Yom Kippur). Four weeks is usually the length of the 'wash' between treatments, so\nI'm a bit past that. I'm eager to restart treatment, but certainly wish my body could have\ntaken a longer break from chemo, as I've had so much of it. Dr. Beavis indicated that my\nneuropathy is likely to get worse and there is a litany of scary potential side effects with\nAvastin. I do hope a clinical trial will be a next step.\nLooking at my date book, I see lots of medical appointments this past week, but I did\nmanage to get out for a long drive (I'm determined to spend as much time outdoors as\npossible in October, just as I had a similar goal in May/June - some of these days, colors,\nsmells, tastes are too beautiful to miss out on!). I enjoyed a fun outing last night with my\nfriends Mar and Maria to a newish brewery/restaurant, Titan Hollow. The place is\nenormous, large enough to accommodate the dinner-theatre production in which Mar's\nwife Jessi had a large part. The play was a 'whodunnit' murder mystery with many\ninteractive twists, and great fun. The locally brewed hard cider was also delish!\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Just a short post to share that I tested positive for Covid yesterday morning. A friend had\ncontacted me Saturday, I believe, to let me know that she had tested positive after our\nbreak fast at the synagogue last Wednesday. To the best of my knowledge, at least five\npeople came out of Yom Kippur services with Covid. I had tested myself Friday and\nSunday and was negative, went out both days and felt ok (except for a very slight dry\ncough), then Sunday night started to decline. Felt horrendous this morning -- splitting\nheadache, cough, fatigue (have been resting all day), some chills, nausea. This evening I\nfeel no worse, the chills seem to have dissipated, the headache is now low-grade, and I\nwas even able to eat a bit of dinner, thanks to Michael and Sue's generosity in grilling a\nribeye. I'm hoping that my compromised immune system can rally and fight this thing\noff. I think we were all a bit traumatized by the horror stories from the early days of\nCovid. Unfortunately, I've not had my third booster yet, as it's scheduled for about a\nweek from now.\nBen, here for a week I had hoped would be full of fun activities (foliage drives, movies\netc.) is an incredibly caring, competent, calm soul. I am terribly disappointed that he\nonce again needs to help me out (and of course am concerned about him getting Covid\ntoo), but we're still looking forward to watching the Yankees in the playoffs tomorrow\nnight (though probably in different rooms!).\nMy doctor did not yet phone in a prescription for me for Paxlovid today, despite my\nmultiple calls and portal messages to his office, including at least one that was 'fast\ntracked' to him. Grrr... Frustrating and stressful. Will resume my efforts tomorrow, not\neasy in my current state.\nI am so touched by recent calls, texts and emails from friends.

    "entry": "....or, \"what a shitty week!,\" as one of my friends aptly put it. Like clockwork, poor Ben\ncame down with Covid Thursday night, exhibiting the same symptoms I experienced:\nchills, cough, congestion, fatigue + fever. Since he's not taking an antiviral med as I am,\n                    \nhis symptoms might actually be worse than mine. He's definitely not feeling well, but as\nhe's young and strong and heathy, he's pushing through, taking regular walks around\nthe neighborhood and helping me out immensely around the house. We're drinking tea\n(and water and apple cider), sucking on cough drops, ingesting Ibuprofen, cooling down\nwith popsicles, rooting on the Yankees (yesterday's game a disappointment...) and trying\nto get through this. Despite the general yuckiness of the past seven days, when we lit\nShabbat candles and talked about what we were grateful for this week, we agreed that\nbeing together and bringing comfort (and gallows humor) to one another had been a\nboon, and that we certainly could have had it worse. \nI tested positive again this morning, no surprise. I'm improving, but quite incrementally\nat this point. I'm still congested and fatigued, and need energy to deal with my cancer.\nCovid has downstream effects on my cancer treatment. My chemo has to be put off for\ntwo weeks on top of the many weeks I've already gone without any treatment as we\nweighed the various next best options (clinical trials, chemo etc.). My consult at M.D.\nAnderson, in turn, has also been moved to a later date. Oh well. Must bend with the\nbamboo. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that my immune system has been so\nsuccessful so far in fighting Covid.\nMichael and Sue generously provided us with two delicious dinners this week, as I don't\nhave much 'oomph' for cooking (although I'll try to make some red lentil soup with lemon\nlater). Thanks to local friends who have been checking in and also offering help (you\nknow who you are!) -- I am *very grateful* for your help and kindness!\nIt's a gorgeous day and I'm going to try to take a drive (or perhaps two drives, one with\nBen after the big PSU-Michigan game) today.

    "entry": "Health update: \"A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" as never encountered by the Baudelaire\nchildren...\nThankfully, both Ben and I are over Covid. Well, that was one heck of an unpleasant two-\nweek detour. Geez, Louise... I finally tested negative yesterday, after the virus had\nprogressed from something flu-like (cough, congestion, aches and pains, chills, fatigue)\nthrough a bad head cold to the lingering slight congestion I'm experiencing now. Ben's\ntrajectory was a bit different, and thankfully shorter: flu-like symptoms with persistent\nsore throat and loss of taste and smell, which have not yet returned. I was overjoyed to\nsee the spring in his step once again (he managed to power through full work days,\nexcept for one or two afternoons he took off so he could rest), and he's now back in New\nYork. Sharing Covid purgatory was actually a blessing and new variant of 'mother-son\nbonding' (I guess...); Ben and I both tend to be fairly 'up' people by nature so we kept\n                    \none another afloat, peppering our conversations with plenty of gallows humor... We\ncooked healthy meals and watched the Yankees-Guardians series (yay!) and then the\nYankees-Astros series (ugh, but fourth-generation Yankees fan Ben, whose grandfather\nclimbed onto the roof of Joe DiMaggio's car back in the day to snap his picture in the\ndriver's seat, was invited to Game 4 tonight!). It was unfortunate that Ben couldn't spend\nmore time with his dad, but we didn't want to risk Michael and Sue being exposed.\nMichael was in touch with Ben several times daily and was also checking up on me. I\nshould mention, too, that throughout my two or so years of dodging Covid and being\nshielded from it in the hospital when I had surgeries in 2020 and 2022, I always imagined\nthat, should I contract the virus, it would be difficult (and potentially dangerous) to shake\nb/c of my fragile immune system. So the fact that, in the end, Covid did not appear to hit\nme harder than it did others I know who have had it, reassured me.\nYet Covid is tricky for cancer patients. My treatment has been delayed by two weeks to\nallow for full recovery. I'm slated to start a new line of chemo on Tuesday (blood work\ntomorrow). Before that, though, I had a four-week 'washout' period between lines of\nchemo. And I'm certain that there were at least two other weeks in there when I was\nexploring different options, acting like I had all the time in the world to forestall\ntreatment! I don't even want to look at my calendar to see when I had my last treatment\nbut I think early September.  I never imagined I'd be hit with Covid at this critical\njuncture... In the past few days I think I've begun to feel a bit 'symptomatic' - but maybe\nthat's a result of my anxiety? Discomfort under my right rib cage and in my upper-\nabdominal area, where an enlarged lymph node sits. Is this what it feels like to stop\ntreatment? Has my cancer progressed significantly while I've awaited chemo?\nAnd the treatment I'm about to receive (Avastin + Doxil) constitutes the *least* desirable\nof the three options Dr. Beavis had laid out for me.  The result with each line of chemo I\nhave received has been a net progression of the disease, but perhaps this new combo\nwill help a bit. I'm not optimistic, though. Only about two days ago, I received definitive\nword from Hopkins that no slot would be available for me at this time in the Phase I\nclinical trial Dr. Beavis had signaled to me. Phase I trials are the riskiest (v. Phase II and\nIII) as their goal is primarily to establish correct dosage levels of certain medications or\nmedication combos, relying on volunteers such as myself. However, the interesting thing\nabout this trial for me is that one of the drugs used targets a specific mutation my tumor\nexhibits.  Apparently, the trial sponsor (ie pharma company) has been jerking Hopkins\naround, telling Hopkins both that they want more slots opened for the trial *and* that\nthey need more time to evaluate [something?]). So now I am mad at a nameless,\nfaceless Big Pharma company too, for delaying my access to potentially life-prolonging\ntreatment. I'll be on the waiting list for access to the trial; perhaps after completing my\nnext line of chemo, followed by a scan and washout period, I'll be eligible, *if* the timing\nworks out (and that's a big 'if').\nI do plan to travel to Houston in mid-November for an appointment with Dr. Shannon\n                    \nWestin, a gyn-onc with an excellent reputation. MDA is running clinical trials that Dr.\nBeavis concurs look interesting for me, several involving immunotherapy. Yes, Houston is\nfar, but I need to find out for myself what would be involved should I have the\nopportunity of gaining access to a trial there.  People travel there from all over the world,\nas they do to all major medical centers. And my college friend/guardian angel Steve\nSherman is an oncologist at MDA, has offered to help me out if needed, and knows Dr.\nWestin!\nI went to look at plots at Centre County Memorial Park a few days ago. Dying is\nexpensive! Yeesh...  Cemeteries/funeral homes really nail you, but I guess they figure\nthey have a 'captive audience...' I simply wanted to take care of this so my family will\nhave less to figure out - whenever the time comes.  My acute natural curiosity leads me\nto be quite fascinated by rituals surrounding death, burial etc., so the cemetery visit was\nsimply 'interesting' (certainly not scary or traumatizing) and the site serene and beautiful\non a sunny autumn day. What I've decided so far is that I'd like to be buried in the\n'liberal' quadrant of the Jewish section (where interfaith couples can be buried, where\ncremated remains can be buried etc.). It was poignant and comforting to find 'friends'\nthere -- a couple that joined a PSU alumni tour to France that I led shortly after arriving\nat Penn State; the son of lovely friends in my congregation, who died in his early forties\nfrom cancer... I had been leaning towards cremation, but now I'm contemplating the\nmore traditional Jewish burial in a plain pine box. Holes are drilled into the concrete vault\nin which the casket is placed, essentially letting the casket and human remains\nbiodegrade and return to the earth. I have explored a bit what a 'green burial' entails as\nthat would be my preference, but the practice is still not widespread and the resources\nseemingly unavailable in central PA. \nYesterday my friend B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte called me soon after I rolled out of bed and suggested we\nmight hit an auction in Centre Hall; we had talked about our love of auctions and\nantiquing and she had introduced me to the site auctionzip.com, which contains listings\nof auctions by zip code. A gorgeous fall day; a farm on a central PA backroad; a crowd of\ndealers, curiosity seekers, Amish families, locals; a talented auctioneer with a\nmesmerizing patter; assorted tools, vintage toys, stoneware crocks, furniture, even the\nfarm itself + its 33 acres -- all made for a delightful post-Covid outing!\n \n \n \n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "Health update: Something feels 'amiss' in my upper abdomen. Discomfort under my right\nrib cage, in my stomach area (liver? cancerous lymph node near my stomach?\nintestines?). Feels uncomfortable when I bend over or compress that area in any way.\nNot much appetite. Some nausea from time to time, but not chronically. Fatigue. No\nacute pain, though. Taking Tylenol, antacids, nausea med. Wonder if the new chemo\ncombo might be disagreeing with me more than others. Wonder if that long hiatus from\ntreatment might have affected me adversely. Wonder if it's nothing to worry about.\nWonder, wonder, wonder. Yesterday's routine CT-scan (pelvis, abdomen, chest) was\ntherefore well-timed (although long and boring, with about two hours spent in my car\n                    \ndrinking at intervals the icky pre-scan barium concoction); I've written Drs. Patel and\nBeavis to see if they can review the scans themselves and let me know if they see\nanything that needs to be attended to. I'm slated to go to NY this weekend, and really\nwant to, as early as Thursday. I hope I might have some clarity tomorrow, either from my\noncologists or the radiologists reading the images.\nI have bought my plane ticket to Houston (actually bought it w/miles accrued on my\ncredit card), for mid-November. I'll consult about clinical trials that might be appropriate\nfor me and related treatment issues with Dr. Shannon Westin, a gyn-onc who comes\nhighly recommended. I will also assess the feasibility for me of treatment in Houston\n(cost, time, energy, potential winter travel); people travel to M.D. Anderson, as to other\nmajor medical centers, from all over the world, but will that scenario work for me (my\nhunch is that if it has a good chance of prolonging my life, then yes)? Ben will kindly\nmeet me in Houston after my appointment; we'll spend the night there, then drive the\nnext day to Austin, where my friend and long-ago PSU colleague Jim Davis is lending me\nhis condo (thanks, Jim!) in this groovy food and music mecca, a liberal enclave in red\nTexas. I've been twice to Austin but a long time ago. I'm trusting Jim to take us to his\nfavorite Mexican and/or bbq joints. I'm always delighted to spend a weekend with my\nbest travel buddy. And I'm grateful/relieved that a small but solid support network is\nemerging for me in Houston, consisting of my college friend Steve Sherman, himself an\noncologist at M.D. Anderson; my grad school colleague, Julie Fette, whom my friend\nDenis Provencher let know, over breakfast in Montreal, that I was coming to Houston\n(Julie teaches at Rice; thanks, Denis!); and my cousin Dina, who now lives in Houston\nwith her family (Ilene, please thank Dina again for me; thanks too, aunt Marlene!). Both\nJulie and Dina have offered help in whatever form I need. There are angels everywhere.\nFortunately, chemo day only comes around every other week, but it's a rough go this\ntime.\nI really haven't done much this past week as I was feeling a bit off my game and also\nkicking out the remnants of Covid (good riddance...). I managed a visit from a friend and\na lunch out. A lovely hydrangea-covered card from Clare, spending the year in Europe,\nlifted my spirits as did thoughtful 'self-care' gifts from Melissa, and kind texts and emails.\nI've gotten out for some drives as I had vowed to absorb the magnificent October\nweather. I hardly remember the fall colors ever being so vibrant: pierced through with\nsunlight, the leaves seemed to have a sheen. The orange leaves were literally the color\nof oranges! Some leaves called out to me 'burnt sienna' or 'burnt umber,' in homage to\ntwo of the Crayola crayons I loved as a kid. And others, actually needles from some type\nof fir tree, had turned a deep, velvety crimson like the ribbons on potted poinsettia\nplants, a Christmas color. Breathtaking panoramas of color framing the farms and\nvillages of central PA.\n                    \nBe well, everyone.\nP.S. I just finished a France and the Holocaust-themed book that held my attention\nthroughout, _La Carte postale,_ by Anne Berest. I do recommend it (I believe the English\ntranslation is out now>_The Postcard_).\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Just another quick update: I am sorry if I worried anyone yesterday with my news. Yes, it\nis unwelcome, but I also tend to become very anxious when I receive such news of\ndevelopments in my condition (although not unexpected), and I imagine I was projecting\n                    \nsome of that -- or perhaps the news itself was simply scary. But it's not dire. My MRI\nyesterday went smoothly. Dr. Patel called me this morning to discuss that scan and\nconfirmed that there are two tiny (mm) spots on my left and right frontal lobes and a few\nother spots here and there. He wasn't seeing much bleeding to speak of but he took me\noff my blood thinner. I also now have an appointment with my radiologist next week,\nmost likely to discuss radiating the spots (no surgery will happen). Dr. Patel confirmed\nthat the spots can return (also not unexpected); that sneaky, dastardly cancer found\nsome new pathways into my brain. Cancer has also made inroads into my upper\nabdominal area (where I was having acute discomfort, sending me to the emergency\nroom). Armed with Tylenol (every four hours) and Oxycodone (as needed; I don't take it\nmuch), I'm succeeding in getting my symptoms under control. No more splitting\nheadaches, but I can actually feel the cancerous spots causing me some discomfort at\nthe front of my head. But I am not at death's door. I am not The Dying Girl and don't\nwant to  be cast (or cast myself) in that role (is it obvious to restate that finitude is a\nreality for all of us?).\nI am feeling more emotionally even keel today. I took care of a whole bunch of emails\nand texts, esp. with my doctors, then took a nice long drive, which is what I do to clear\nmy head. Stopped by the antique store and bought an Art Deco-looking vase for.... 84\ncents! The fall colors have peaked but they are not completely gone. I'm extremely sorry\nnot to be in NY this weekend, but feel I made the right decision to stay put. This means I\ncan see a few friends here, within close range.\nI look forward to a good chat with Rabbi Ostrich on Sunday.\nNo pity party (as my cousin and I always tell each other). I am glad to be alive and\nabundantly blessed!\nGood shabbos.",

    "entry": "After the hell of last week -- splitting headaches, nausea, vomiting bile, loss of appetite,\nacute abdominal discomfort, day in the ER, discovery of new brain mets and of slight\nprogression of cancer in abdomen, multiple scans and MRI (over the hills Greg Fox and I\nwent to a rather forlorn Geisinger outpost in Mifflintown, 30 miles from State College),\nanxiety-fueled certainty that my death was imminent, lots of unpleasant 'd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over\nagain' moments -- on the heels of the hell of the previous weeks (Covid!) -- I am back on\nmy horse, feeling a good bit better (yet far from perfect) now that I have gotten\nsymptoms under control with Tylenol every four hours, smaller meal portions, and a\nblander diet than normal. Emotionally, I'm on a much more even keel this week.\nTo recap 'this week in cancer:' Monday: labs (counts a bit out of whack because of what\nmy body had endured the week before; magnesium count very low); Tuesday: chemo\n(Avastin) + magnesium drip. Dr. Patel advises I maintain my current chemo regimen\nunless my team decides otherwise. No major side effects from the chemo, just some\nfatigue that didn't preclude my running errands, taking drives etc.; Wednesday: early\ndentist appointment to repair a chipped front tooth (I was tired from having stayed up\nlate the night before watching the election returns, yet elated as I had glanced at my\nphone at 4 a.m. and had seen that John Fetterman had won the Senate election! and\nthat our state house had gone blue for the first time in eleven years, which is huge).\nOn Thursday I met with Dr. Patel (jeune), the radiologist I had worked with after my brain\nsurgery in January. We 'vibed' better this time; on our first go-around I had found him\nsomewhat defensive and edgy. He seemed kinder on Thursday, and empathic, and\nunrushed. I will receive three fairly high-dose stereotactic radiation treatments,\npinpointing the two cancerous spots that he clearly detects in my brain. There may be\nother small cancerous areas but as they are too small (I presume) to be clearly identified\nas such, he will hold off on radiating them until next time. Now that those dastardly\ncancer cells have found a way into my brain, I presume (and he implied) that they may\nreturn (when? how many? how often? a sobering prospect). The goal, he said, will be to\navoid whole brain radiation, with its attendant risks of Scary Things happening to the\nbrain (e.g. memory and cognitive impairment). So some decisions will need to be made\nat that point. Personally, these may simply not be acceptable risks for me. My brain's my\nthing and thankfully for the moment it's still pretty darn sharp. I'll start the treatments\nafter Thanksgiving. But this coming Monday I'll undergo yet another CT-scan of my brain\nand get fitted for my mask (that gruesome Life of Brian meets Silence of the Lambs\ncontraption that I was buckled into and then buckled onto the radiation table with in\nFebruary). Three months later, barring any untoward developments, I'll have a scan to\nsee whether we've held the cancer at bay. So, again a bit of a reprieve for now.\nThe 'bleeding in my brain' refers simply to some tiny amounts of blood pooling inside the\nnew lesions. I do not have a brain bleed. No surgical intervention is necessary.\n                    \nA pleasant antidote to thinking about all the medical stuff was dinner last night with my\nfriend Deb at Creekside at the Gamble Mill, a newly-renovated restaurant in what once\nwas an 1894 mill. It was lots of fun to catch up and check out a new restaurant. So many\npeople kindly tell me I look wonderful -- a point I do concede for the most part (does that\nsound arrogant?). I do not at present look like scary Cancer Girl. I just wish I felt as good\nas I look.\nNow that all the pieces have fallen into place -- I'm cleared for travel, know that a\nconsultation is still a possibility etc. - I am headed to TX next week! Unfortunately,\nbecause of the new brain lesions, clinical trials are currently off the table for me. This\ntook quite a bit of wind out of my sails. Was it going to be worthwhile even to make the\ntrip, given the fact that M.D. Anderson currently has nothing to offer me (as far as I can\ntell)? Nevertheless, I decided that it would be worth it to speak with Dr. Shannon Westin,\na gyn-onc with an excellent reputation, see what might be available *down the line* if I\ncan ward off a recurrence of new brain mets for at least 6 months-1 year, get on the gyn-\nonc team's radar screen, glean information about promising new treatments, have any\npreliminary tests needed (e.g. blood work) etc. My college classmate/oncologist at M.D.\nAnderson/guardian angel Steve Sherman has also smoothed my path at MDA and I hope\nto have dinner with him and his wife there. The trip will also offer an opportunity for Ben\nand me to have an adventure as we like'em: he'll meet me Wednesday night in Houston,\nhaving flown from NY (I reserved rooms in a swanky looking new Intercontinental near\nMDA because \"Why not?\"). He'll work remotely on Thursday, following which we'll drive\nto Austin for the weekend; I've visited this capital city twice but not for a long time. My\nformer colleague and friend Jim is nicely lending us his condo and I look forward to\nseeing him and meeting his husband, Danny. I have a few items on my Austin wish list --\nI'd love to check out a great Western wear shop and a two-step dancing hall and some of\nthe 'weird' that 'keeps Austin weird' - but I'm flexible and await suggestions. If any of\n*you* have Austin favorites - best taqueria? Tex-Mex joint? Q? Shop? Bar?\nNeighborhoods? Other hot takes? - please let me know!\nAnd then it will be back here for two days before heading to NY for the holiday -- barring\nany unforeseen health hiccups, which I can never predict of course.\nI also have made an appointment to meet with Dr. Beavis at Hopkins on Dec. 8th. It's\nbeen a long time since I've seen her in person, and I want to make extra sure our close\nconnection doesn't dissipate. It's so hard to juggle this many doctors and make so many\nimportant decisions.\nAfter Bono's pronouncement on the Stephen Colbert show that if he had to listen to one\nsong for the rest of his life it would be the Bee Gees' \"Immortality\" -- I am unabashedly a\nBee Gees fan and have always found them immensely talented -- I have been very taken\nwith it. Have a listen to this version, a type of prayer by Barry Gibb for his three\n                    \ndeceased brothers and bandmates (and read the lyrics elsewhere if you wish):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al8acNZzmxI",

    "entry": "Back c. 10:30 p.m. last night from my Texas adventure. Exhausted on my return after\nawaking early yesterday; driving three hours from Austin to Houston's IAH airport; flying\nfrom Houston to Philly; laying over several hours in Philly; flying from Philly to State\nCollege; and finally, driving home. Somehow, though, I managed to power through\n(willapower?). Air-travel induced headaches/head pressure caused by the new cancer did\nnot materialize, thankfully, and I tried to move my legs as frequently as possible to avoid\nclots (I think I'm ok on that front too). In short, I squeaked through although the travel\nproved somewhat stress-inducing.\nEnjoyed a delicious burger topped w/fried poblano pepper, cheese, bacon and\ncaramelized onions *plus* a margarita in the hotel lobby and chilled out from the trip.\nNoted a visible police and security presence milling about the lobby. Turns out the\nPresident of Panama was in residence.\nHealth update: On the whole, I felt pretty well during the entire trip, but was definitely\nmaking an effort to 'rise to the occasion' for the reunions with friends and adventure with\nBen. My stomach did not always take well to some of the delicious (yet sometimes spicy,\nsometimes heavy) tacos, Tex-Mex, and barbecue I was intent on sampling (Ben too!), but\nfind that reducing my portion size by about half usually helps me avoid an achy stomach\nand nausea.\nSomehow on the trip down to Houston a brewing UTI hit me full-force. Most thankfully,\nthe gyn-onc staff at MDA took a urine sample and then prescribed an antibiotic, without\nwhich it would have been a painful and worrisome trip. Whew. In fact, there were a few\ninitial hiccups that made me hope they weren't omens for the remainder of the trip: Avis\nhad rented all its sedans, so Ben wound up with a ....pick-up truck. Very Texas, to be\nsure, but the thing was really unwieldy to drive, not to mention park. My (cowboy) hat is\ntipped to Ben, though, for keeping his cool as he always does. By the end of the week,\nhe was driving that behemoth like a champ. Understandably, Ben was not in a great\nmood on his arrival -- flight delayed, a mountain of work to confront, a full work day\nbehind him, the car rental snafu -- but there too, the week only improved.\nMy consultation at MDA went as I had hoped and expected. Dr. Shannon Westin, a highly\nknowledgeable, skilled, compassionate gyn-onc about Dr.  Beavis' age -- filled me in on\nsome of the clinical trials involving targeted therapies currently being conducted at MDA.\nShe scooted her chair very close to mine as she explained things to me. One trial\ninvolves removing immune cells from the patient, 'ramping them up' so as to better fight\nthe ovarian cancer, then reintroducing them into the patient's body. Another involves\nremoving, then reinserting, a small piece of the patient's tumor, again doing something\nto it [didn't quite grasp what] to enable the body to fight the o.c. more effectively. She\ndescribed how some treatments involve 'putting on the brakes' and others involve\n                    \n'taking the brakes off' (the immune system, for example). MDA  definitely sets the gold\nstandard for many of the most innovative clinical trials and treatments these days.\nBut of course - as I knew - I am not eligible now for a clinical trial as my brain cancer has\nrecurred. Why is this? The clearest answer I've been able to get is that the medical\nfacility conducting the trial (or perhaps the drug company sponsoring it, or both) wants\nto compare 'apples to apples,' ie select for the trial patients with ovarian cancer *only*\n(and sometimes with a particular tumor type or genetic marker). There are often other\nrestrictions, too, as I experienced at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Otherwise, I presume, the\nsecondary cancer might interfere with, cause delays in, or react adversely to the\nexperimental treatment. *However,* Dr. Westin said there is pushback (from the FDA,\nphysicians and others) against the stipulation that brain mets preclude participation in a\nclinical trial. When might this policy be changed? Likely not in my lifetime. Grrr.\nDr. Westin did allude to the fact, though, that there *are* a few trials allowing patients\nwith brain mets to participate in them. Must follow up on that tantalizing piece of info\nwith Dr. Beavis.\nEchoing what I've heard from other sources, Dr. Westin confirmed that the jury is still out\non whether immunotherapy is an effective treatment for o.c. She did mention two chemo\ndrugs, however, that I had not heard of and with which I have not yet been treated. I will\nalso discuss this with Dr. Beavis when I head to Baltimore in early December for an\nappointment. Dr. Beavis also mentioned seeing whether Hopkins might have something\nto offer me right now. The problem is that I've had an awful lot of chemo, and still my\ndisease progresses. I was really hoping for a clinical trial but bad timing with the brain\nmets; I'll receive three high-dose treatments of radiation after Thanksgiving.\nI am grateful to Dr. Westin and her team, though, for conveying a hopeful message:\n\"There are options.\" And regret neither this \"information gathering mission\" nor the\nopportunity to get on MDA's radar screen as a potential patient (ie I'm 'in their system'\nnow). If the planets aligned for me to receive treatment there (I'd need to be free of\nbrain mets for six months [or was it a year?], and I just don't think that's going to\nhappen), I'd have to think hard about the feasibility of this prospect, logistically. It's a\ntotal schlep (more like an odyssey) to get there and back, and that fact alone (aside from\nexpense etc.) gives me pause. But I'm far from needing to make decisions about that;\nwhen and if the time comes...\nI shared some of the day's developments with my dinner companions: my college\nclassmate Steve Sherman, an endocrinologist at MDA who has been so helpful and kind\ntowards me since I learned of my diagnosis and contacted him in a panic, and his wife\nJanine, a registered nurse working in women's health (a lovely person with whom I very\nmuch enjoyed speaking). Despite the relative brevity of our meeting, Steve struck me\nmuch as he did in college: a thoughtful, intellectually sharp guy with a good sense of\n                    \nhumor. I believe he is my only college classmate who was also a dormmate for four\nyears, first in Stoughton Hall (we reminisced!), then in Currier House. Steve and Janine\nseem to be enjoying a wonderful life of travel (often to Italy), time with their three grown\nchildren (one of whom will soon marry), and successful careers. Happy for them! Dinner\nat Caf\u00e9 Rabelais in Rice Village, finished off with a profiterole for each of us and\naccompanied by a tasty Sancerre, was excellent (respecting my 'small portion = no\nstomach distress' rule, I brought a good part of my dinner back to the hotel for Ben).\nBoth Dr. Westin and Steve and Janine thought I looked 'great.' This has now become\nsomething of a tea-leaf reading exercise for me. On the one hand, Dr. Beavis has\nmaintained that one can 'look great' yet still be quite ill (I remember meeting a\nphysically beautiful friend of Michael's a long time ago; she had melanoma and died\nseveral months after we stayed with her and her husband in their apartment in\nBloomington, IN). On the other, Steve and Janine suggested that 'looking great' might\nmanifest a strong, life-affirming spirit, which in turn *might* affect prospects for survival.\nHard to know, yet I try to decode whatever signs present themselves to me, likely with a\ngood dose of projection involved.  And I am appreciative of the compliments!\nWill write about our fun weekend in Austin in my next entry (I hope). Tired now -- and\nneed to turn around and start packing for New York, as tomorrow is a chemo day and I'm\nlikely to be worn out when I get home.\nPhotos",

My\ndoctor part kicks in, don't read on if you've had enough input. I am nowhere near\nknowledgeable about OC. I assume that brain mets are an exclusion because if you get a\ntumor response in the brain, then you have brain swelling/inflammation and that is hard\nto manage.

    "entry": "Some of what I'm grateful for today:\n**Fourth* Thanksgiving since my diagnosis;\n*I've been given this day, and am feeling, on the whole, alright;\n*A dear friend recuperating well from an operation that should eliminate a host of\ntroublesome, worrisome symptoms;\n*Two of my chemo nurses, Brianne and Tracey. After not having seen me at chemo for a\nfew weeks,  Tracey, this past Tuesday, planted a big, friendly, affectionate kiss on my\ncheek. She had been working the polls during my last chemo session; she, Brianne and I\nare on the same page politically and socially, although we've needed to keep those\nconversations hushed, because you never know what the reaction might be around here.\nBoth Tracey and Brianne help keep me grounded in the present -- in the day, the\nmoment -- even as I experience setbacks. They keep me buoyant with their expert care,\nconcern, and friendship.\n*A wonderful reunion in Austin after about thirty years with my former colleague, my\nfriend Jim Davis. Jim thoughtfully set Ben and me up in his comfy Austin condo, and\narranged an insider's tour of the city with his friend (of a friend), Craig. Grateful for Jim's\nkindness, loyalty, interesting life, and sense of humor that keeps me laughing when I'm\nwith him!\n*My ability to make the trip to Houston and Austin last week, even as travel becomes a\nbit harder for me;\n*A red tsunami averted by the efforts of the millions of patriots who realized that our\ndemocracy was imperiled. A democratic governor, senator and state house in our\nCommonwealth!\n*My wondrously compassionate and loving son, Ben;\n*My family: Ben & Sammi, mom & Arnold, Ethan & Ronit (and her family), Eve, Isaac,\nJulie, Aunt Marlene, Michael (and his family), Ruth, Claudia and my many other cousins in\nthe U.S. and Canada.\n*My beloved friends, some of multiple decades, others of more recent date.\nIf all this gratitude stuff is too much for you, try to catch Amy Schumer's funny parody of\nthe notion (and practice). Can't find the link, but saw it on Facebook.\nMy prayers going out today to the friend mentioned above, recovering from surgery;\nanother friend recovering from surgery; and a dear friend of many decades, currently\nundergoing chemotherapy. Who knew, when we were teenagers shopping for clothes at\nBloomingdale's, lunching on burgers after school ended on Fridays, and having\nsleepovers, that this would be part of our shared life journey?\nSo my Thanksgiving  plans imploded this year. About half an hour before I was to leave\nto drive to the Lewistown Junction train station yesterday, my brother -- our host and\n                    \nchef this year - texted me from New York to say he had tested positive, twice, for Covid\nand that he was fully symptomatic (awful cough, chills etc.). That meant, of course, that\nThanksgiving as planned was off, and my main concern remains that my brother feel\nbetter and that his family stay healthy. I then called my mother, who had also received\nthe news, and learned that she too was feeling under the weather (Covid-negative yet\nred, scratchy throat) and was discouraging me from staying with her in the city, as\nplanned. I next called Ben, asking if I could stay in his apartment while he was in\nAmherst, MA, with his dad, aunt and uncle, and Berkman cousins. That way, I thought I\ncould still have lunch with a bunch of my college friends on Friday, as also planned,\nspend Sunday with Ben (ditto), and help out my brother or mother if needed. Ben said\nhe'd leave his keys with the neighbors, so I threw my bags in my car, and headed to\nLewistown without a minute to spare.\nEn route to Lewistown (about 25 miles from my house), I began to have a change of\nheart as I thought about navigating the city on a holiday weekend, taking the subway\ninto Manhattan from Brooklyn for my appointments, hauling my heavy bags up the steep\nstaircases of Ben's walkup, buying groceries, perhaps trying to get myself 'adopted' by\none of my friends for Thanksgiving etc. Cause or consequence, a nasty headache started\nto come on, compounded by the fatigue from both chemo the previous day and the\nrecent trip to Texas, from which I had just returned. I pulled off the road an exit or two\nbefore Lewistown, made my final resolution, called Ben, then turned around and headed\nback to State College. I was so mentally and physically exhausted that I slept for several\nhours.\nSo it's an odd, somewhat isolating day, but it's ok. I miss not being with my family, just\nas I miss our holiday traditions (chocolate turkeys at each table setting) and special\nfoods (both cooking and eating them). We all texted one another this morning with\nholiday greetings. But no pity party. My brother's health is the priority. And I've enjoyed\nmany memorable Thanksgivings in the past. Cancer has granted me the serenity to\n\"accept the things I cannot change\" in many different situations. State College friends, I\ngave serious thought to contacting some of you who I know are in town to see if you\nmight set another place at your table for me; I feel confident you would have graciously\nsaid yes. But in the end, I'm opting for a contemplative day, with my Wegman's turkey\ndinner and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to enjoy -- for which I am sincerely grateful! I\nam around this weekend, though. :)\nHere are excerpts from two poems that have resonated with me recently, and especially\non this day, and at this time in my life:\nFrom Ross Gay, \"Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude\"\nSoon it will be over,\n                    \nwhich is precisely what the child in my dream said,\nholding my hand, pointing at the roiling sea and the sky\nhurtling our way like so many buffalo,\nwho said it\u2019s much worse than we think,\nand sooner; to whom I said\nno duh child in my dreams, what do you think\nthis singing and shuddering is,\nwhat this screaming and reaching and dancing\nand crying is, other than loving\nwhat every second goes away? [my emphasis]\nGoodbye, I mean to say.\nAnd thank you. Every day.\n                    \nFrom Joy Harjo, \"Praise the Rain\" (w/thanks to my friend Sally):\nPraise crazy. Praise sad.\nPraise the path on which we're led.\nPraise the roads on earth and water.\nPraise the eater and the eaten.\nPraise beginnings; praise the end.\nPraise the song and praise the singer.\nHappy Thanksgiving, everyone.",

    "entry": "In the end, I'm glad I turned around en route to the Lewistown train station, as I've been\nenjoying a restful, restorative weekend. I was overwhelmed by the generosity and\nthoughtfulness of those who reached out to me immediately on reading about my\nderailed plans: Maria called me as soon as she read my post on Thursday to invite me to\njoin her family for the pies they were about to tuck into; Ben's darling bff from grade\nschool, Nikhil, dropped by Thursday evening with his mother to hand deliver leftovers\nfrom their Indian-American feast (the best Indian food I've had in a long while!) - let's\nhear it for the little boys who used to play basketball together in the Pioneer League\ngrowing into such thoughtful, caring young men!; Sandy delivered to my doorstep an\nentire almond-pear tart from The Hummingbird Room (very yummy); Deb and Tony had\nme to dinner Friday for delicious Thanksgiving leftovers and interesting conversation;\nMonique invited me for dinner last night. I am so humbled. Best.friends.ever. I love the\nnetworks of care that somehow seem to develop easily in smaller communities.\nI know many friends were out of town this weekend and never expected such a wave of\nkindness.\nMeanwhile, my brother, thankfully, is on the mend from Covid, but my sister-in-law just\ntested positive...\nHealth update: I am feeling decent, status quo. I took a long drive in the glorious\nsunshine and saw a team of five horses plowing a field; bought some carrots and kale at\na local farm. Tylenol staves off headaches. Keeping my portions small; I have a feeling\nthat a cancerous lymph node sitting atop my stomach that has increased slightly in size\nis also pressing on my stomach. Hoping that Dr. Patel (the younger) will finish up my\ntreatment plan early next week so I can be scheduled for three radiation treatments next\nweek and/or the following one, when I will also go to Baltimore for an appointment with\nDr. Beavis. No chemo until next Tuesday. Will meet with my palliative care doc via\nvideoconference this week; she'll help me fill out my DNR card to affix to my fridge and\ndiscuss other items on my agenda.\nA brief report on our weekend in Austin:\nThings are *big* in Texas: big hair (did not see any but am assured it's a thing); big belt\nbuckles and cowboy hats; the biggest plastic travel mugs I've ever seen; big people.\nEveryone has guns. Signs at the entrance to many establishments state \"no concealed\nweapons.\"\n\"Keep Austin weird,\" I am told, has now yielded, by all evidence, to \"Keep Austin\ngentrifying,\" with the old mom and pop shops, music joints, and grunge neighboring\n                    \nHerm\u00e8s boutiques and Warby Parker outlets. The one taste I got of Austin's weirdness\nduring a two-day visit was our stop for lunch at Wright Brothers Brew & Brew, which\noffers brews (on tap) and brews (coffee). Young crowd. Baristas with tats, long hair, flesh\ntunnels and piercings. Is that really all that weird? It seemed like any number of coffee\nshops one might find in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or Boulder.\nMusic everywhere, every brewery, street corner, two-step dance hall etc. Ditto taco\nstands -- in gas stations, food truck courts etc.\nThursday: we arrived from Houston in our pick up truck around 7:30 p.m., stopping on\nthe way at Buc-ee's, a southern version of Sheetz but with an astounding array of beef\nand turkey jerky (which we sampled) and reputedly immaculate bathrooms (an urban\nlegend?). Headed to a taco truck behind Celis Brewery, Con Todo, that Ben had read\nabout and brought our food back to Jim's condo: I sampled the spiciest taco I had ever\ntasted, full of charred cauliflower, and a tostada with guacamole. Incredibly tasty spices,\nyet hard on my stomach. Everywhere we went, the tortillas were handmade, and fresh\nand delicious. Love the food truck culture in Austin.\nFriday: It was wonderful to see my former colleague Jim and give him a big hug after\nabout thirty years. I introduced him to Ben, whom he had never met, and he regaled us\nwith funny stories about how he and his husband, Danny, had come together as a\ncouple. Jim seems happy in his life in Austin, punctuated by frequent travels, and I'm so\nglad for him. He had engaged a friend of a friend of his, Craig, to be our driver and tour\nguide for the day. Craig is an actor and acting teacher - and native Texan - who took us\non an 'insider's tour' of the city while Jim and I caught up a bit in between stretches of\nsightseeing. It was such a sweet day. We first headed to SoCo (South Congress Ave.), a\npopular area w/interesting shops, mid-century modern hotels, bars etc. I loved Allen's, an\niconic Western wear shop, with its dizzying selection of ornate cowboy boots, Stetsons,\nand shirts with pearl snaps. The boots looked uncomfortable, but I'm assured that the\nleather becomes supple with wear. We stopped for coffee (Joe's), then headed to a food\ntruck park for yet more tacos (fish, this time), homemade salsas/hot sauces and guac at\nVeracruz All Natural Taco, a local chain. After lunch we hit the Texas history museum (on\nthe UT campus) and saw a fascinating exhibit about _La Belle,_ a French ship\ncommandeered by Sieur de la Salle on the orders of Louis XIV that hit a sandbar and\nsank, but was later excavated along with about 1.8 million objects the French had\nbrought with them for both trade and settlement. The French incursion into Texas was a\ndisaster (de la Salle was intent of finding the Mississippi River but was way off in his\ncalculations), enabling the Spanish to establish a stronghold there. Serves those darn\nFrench imperialists right! Craig also drove us through many attractive neighborhoods\n(Arts and Crafts bungalows, mid-century modern houses), past the Texas capitol building\n(the Texas flag is the only state flag allowed to fly at the same height as the U.S. flag, a\ndeal worked out when Texas ceased to be a republic and joined the U.S. in the mid-19th\nc.). Around 4 p.m. I started to flag; I had really surprised myself with my stamina and\n                    \nwas relieved to know that I'm able to 'rise to the occasion' when having a great time.\nBen had to work on Friday but we reunited for dinner at Matt's El Rancho, a popular Tex-\nMex place. 'Popular,' in fact, does not convey the pandemonium generated by the\nthrongs pouring into the restaurant, waiting four deep at the bar, or lining up to add their\nnames to the lengthy list of those waiting to be seated. We waited about 45 minutes for\na table and were ushered in to one of two gigantic dining rooms. Given the size and the\nslightly 'industrial' nature of the place, the food wasn't bad at all. I had a stuffed poblano\nwith rice, refried beans, and a gravy. Copious portions. I also had a margarita, which\nknocked me out; I fell asleep as soon as I returned to Jim's condo!\nSaturday was my day to spend with Ben, a fab, laid back travel companion always game\nfor adventure and good eats. Unfortunately, we awoke to pouring rain and cold temps,\nwhich did not abate all day! We valiantly set out, once again to a Veracruz taco truck, to\nget Ben a breakfast taco, and me a fresh drink with fruit and spinach from their juice bar.\nOur outdoor plans having been foiled, we headed to the LBJ Presidential Library/Museum\non the UT campus. I had never been to a presidential library, and while its tone was\nclearly hagiographic, I came away wondering whether any president today could bring to\nfruition a vision of equality and justice like that of the Great Society. As Johnson had\nbeen president when I was roughly 4-8 or nine, ie during my childhood, I appreciated\nhaving that historical context filled in for me, as my memories are hazy (I do remember\nRFK's and MLK's assassinations, my parents' opposition to the Vietnam War, and space\nexploration, as well as some of the pop culture'realia' on display [troll dolls! 'flower\npower' stickers], but sadly the civil rights movement didn't register with me as a young\nchild). Fascinating. Ben enjoyed it too, especially the hundreds of hours of LBJ phone\ncalls (w/MLK, for example) available for listening. Our last stop was again Allen's, the\nwestern wear shop, where I bought a cute bandana. We then headed home to rest up\nbefore dinner.\nAs we were intent on barbecue, we went to a place Craig had recommended, Lamberts.\nThis place, located in the downtown business district, was slightly upscale, not your\ntypical Texas bbq smokehouse (which I would have enjoyed too). My baby back ribs -- I\ncould only eat two or three -- were just slightly overcooked but their sauce was delicious,\nsweet and smoky. Excellent crispy coleslaw with cashews, tangy with lime. Biscuits.\nHouse made pickles. Ben had some other form of barbecue (brisket, I believe) and a\ntasty local beer on tap.\nWe left early Sunday morning for the three hour drive to Houston\n******'\nI've decided to devote December to the pursuit of hygge: homemade soups, comfy\nsocks, curling up on the sofa in my sunroom with a good book and a cup of tea, hot\n                    \nchocolate, or mulled cider, old movies, projects around the house, aromatherapy, hot\nshowers infused with eucalyptus, candles. Come over for some hot chocolate!\nBut then I start to get the travel bug... New York? Barbados? Turks and Caicos?....\nPhotos",

    "date": "December 3, 2022",
    "entry": "Health update: I started my second course of radiation this week, with two treatments\ndown, three to go. Exactly like last time (February, I believe), I am bolted down to a table\nwearing a very tight-fitting mask that has been molded to my face, while I clamp down\nwith my teeth on a kind of 'bit.' The area around my nose is clear so I can breathe (!).\nDefinitely seems like some medieval form of torture, but rather it's analogous in its\ncurative powers, I suppose, to the 'poison cure' of chemotherapy. Then the neuro-\noncologist and 'The Physicist,' from an adjacent room, beam radiation very precisely\ntowards the two (I believe) brain spots that they are radiating on this round. Their\nprecision is based on several sets of imaging that they've gathered both before and\nduring my session. The treatment takes about 20 minutes. Because it is so\nuncomfortable, I just try to relax my body under the warm blanket enveloping me, close\nmy eyes, and listen to the playlist (they seem to have correctly pegged me for a\n1970s/80s gal, hence Stevie Wonder, CCR, and, poignantly this week, Fleetwood Mac.\nThe technicians are all very kind and reassuring; yesterday they were excited about how\ncool my glittery blue eyeshadow looked under the purple light illuminating my head.\nNo noticeable side effects from the radiation. Some fatigue (I rested afterwards) and low-\ngrade headaches that cleared up with Tylenol.\nI've begun to explore another procedure -- gamma knife treatment -- for my eventual\nrecurrence. 'Eventual' because Dr. Patel has told me that a recurrence is probable;\ncurrently, he is only zapping two spots (in my right and left front lobe), because he is not\nable to visualize the other areas clearly and does not want to radiate anything he's not\nconvinced is cancer. But there do appear to be other areas that \"may or may not be\" and\nif they turn out to \"be,\" they will need to be radiated too. As Dr. Patel remarked: \"We are\ntrying to save your brain.\" I still don't know too much about gamma knife treatment\n(David R., I may need to check in w/you on this) but it seems to me that it might be a\nmore 'advanced' technology, capable of zapping many cancerous brain areas; with\nstereotactic radiation, there seems a limit to the number of areas that can be radiated.\nOur hospital does not offer gamma ray treatment, but many other (major?) hospitals,\nsuch as Hopkins, UPMC in Pittsburgh, and even our larger Geisinger facility in Danville,\nPA, do. So I contacted Christie, the nurse working with Dr. Bettegowda, the fabulous\nneurosurgeon who removed my brain tumor in January, to see if she could help. To my\ngreat relief, she expressed eagerness to help, suggesting that I might need to have a\nconsult with a radiation oncologist at Hopkins but indicating that Dr. Bettegowda would\nalso look at my most recent MRI results and provide feedback. I'm waiting to hear back\nfrom her.\nI'm  now feeling that my brain, in the end, might become the real problem area,\novershadowing even my o.c. And if/when it comes to full brain radiation, with a much\nhigher risk of side effects, there will be choices to make.\n                    \nThroughout all of this, though, I don't feel too bad - at least not this week. I was able to\nget out and about, take care of things, attend a play on campus, work on a project\n(assembling my Caring Bridge site into 'book' form -- now close to 700 pages!). Not\nsleeping great, but am told it may because of the steroid I'm taking before my radiation\ntreatments.\nWill have radiation next Monday, Tuesday, Friday. Tuesday will bring a 'triple whammy'\nwith radiation early, then an appointment with Dr. Patel (the elder), then chemo (the\n'double whammy' with infusions of both drugs, Avastin and Doxil). I'm sure I'll be wiped\nby the end of the day, or maybe I'll just snooze during chemo.\nNext week I'll also travel to Hopkins for an appointment I made with Dr. Beavis. I haven't\nseen her except on a computer screen in a very long time. I want to have a frank\ndiscussion with her about where things stand and gather her thoughts on the best\ntreatment plan for me going forward, given the many moving parts involved: recurrence\nof brain mets, trip to MDA and input from Dr. Westin, availability of treatments at\nHopkins (???) taking into account that my brain mets now appear to preclude\nparticipation in a clinical trial, progression of disease. I am sure that she'll want to\nexamine me and feel confident that she will suggest the very best plan possible at this\nstage. I look forward to seeing her.\nI was so touched that David M., my dear college friend who lives in Baltimore and who\nhas often been one of my 'carers' at Hopkins (sitting with me during infusions, visiting\nme after a surgery, driving me to appointments), offered, this time, to drive me at least\none way between Baltimore and State College, about a 3.5 hour trip! So kind of him; I\nhad planned to drive myself, but then thought twice on realizing that the day before my\ndrive would be rough for me (chemo *and* radiation). So David will drive me home from\nBaltimore to State College, then likely stay over here Thursday night and depart Friday,\nrefreshed. His husband, Peter, who runs a successful catering business, is in overdrive\nfor the holiday season and likely won't be able to join us. My equally dear friend Sandy\ntook me up on my request to drive me to Baltimore on Wednesday, as she has before\n(Sandy also drove me to Newark when I went to Paris in May). What a friend! I selfishly\nlook forward to some 'alone time' with Sandy and David so I can catch up with them in\nthe car. The rides certainly make my life much easier. I could have driven myself, but it\nreally tires me out.\nThis week I found myself veering from my usual stance of gratitude to\ndiscouragement/depression, and back. I'm particularly discouraged about the recurrence\nof my brain mets an the prospect of another recurrence, necessitating further treatment.\nI need further clarity about my situation -- options, prospects. I find myself hoping to\nmake it until my birthday, Ben's birthday, Passover, spring... Perhaps what I can best\nmuster this week is the muted praise Leonard Cohen deems the \"broken hallelujah.\"\n                    \nI wonder whether my friends/readers realized what a marathon my cancer journey would\nbe. Even to me, it seems a bit old. Whereas the first few years, admittedly, brought some\nnotes of 'adventure' -- every procedure, every chemo session, every surgery was new\nand needed to be analyzed in detail -- now my chemo and radiation sessions, bloodwork,\ndoctors' visits etc., seem routine, simply woven into the fabric of my life. I am not\ncomplaining about this! It's simply a shift in perspective, a view from the long haul.\nI teleconferenced with my palliative care doctor, Dr. Vithalani, this week. She helped me\nfill out a DNR order to post on my fridge. She reminded me how important it is for me to\ntake good care of myself these days, and to not pressure myself -- good advice. Also felt\nwell cared for by my therapist, another important member of my support team.\nI hope I won't be abandoned.\nI am grateful this week for coffee this morning with a former student I hadn't seen in\ntwenty years and who is now a professor (of photojournalism) herself. Was gratified that\na course she took with me on human rights has stayed with her. Although the production\nof _Rent_ that I saw on campus on Wednesday with my friend Maria had some flaws, I\nvery much enjoyed it for both its 'message' (\"No day but today\") and the strong\nmemories it stirred up in me about the early days of the AIDS crisis in New York, where I\nwas living at the time. Looking forward to Thai dinner w/my friend Jessica tonight.\np.s. I meant to add: Your comments are so affirming and meaningful to me. A wonderful\nchorus. I'm sorry I don't respond to each one; I'd like to. As you can imagine, it takes me\na long time to write each entry (a labor of love). I try to respond to a few comments each\ntime, but please don't consider my 'non-response' as a sign of neglect. All your comment\nare included in my 'book!' xo",

    "author": "Willa Silverman",
    "date": "December 11, 2022",
    "entry": "On Thursday Dr. Beavis told me much more directly than she ever has that she feels we\nare nearing the end of viable treatment options for my cancer. She shared this as the\nphysician who, in her words, looks at the \"big picture.\" She was seconded by another\nphysician (one of her fellows) and a palliative care nurse also in the small exam room\nwith me, creating a kind of echo chamber. Best case scenario, she said, we'll be sitting in\nthe same exam room at Hopkins a year from now, just before Chanukah. Or I might die\nsooner. Not entirely unexpected, but the prediction of the shortened time  horizon (which\nI have now fetishized) functioned, in the moment, like a gut punch.\nAny reason to nuance this prediction? Well, I have not yet had a CT-scan since I began\ntreatment with Doxil and Avastin. This will come fairly soon, and we'll see whether the\ncancer has progressed. After this line of chemo, there is one more that Dr. Beavis\nrecommends trying, with a drug called Pemetrexid (Alimta). We know that with each\nsuccessive line, the effectiveness of chemotherapy lessens; the sneaky cancer cells\nfigure out ways to elude the \"poison cure.\" And I've had many lines of chemo, which of\ncourse are killing healthy cells too. So we're seemingly at a point of diminishing returns.\nFurther: what if, against all odds, I'm able to stave off additional brain mets for about a\nyear, thus potentially opening up the possibility of my participating in a promising clinical\ntrial? Yes, I suppose this would be possible, but unlikely. I have discussed with Dr. Patel,\nthe radiation oncologist, the likelihood of a recurrence and he has even said, in reference\nto potentially cancerous spots in my brain that he's not able to visualize perfectly now,\n\"I'll get those next time.\" When I finished my radiation treatments this past Friday, he\nsaid: \"I'm going to be honest with you. Your situation is serious. We're really going to\nneed to assess the next MRI [in three months] closely to figure out what the options are\nat that point.\" Of course, even if I began treatment in a trial and developed brain mets in\nthe course of it, I'd have to leave the trial. Also of course, in the six months-year that it\nwould take, hypothetically, for me to be rid of brain mets, another problem could arise: a\nmass in a lymph node close to my stomach, for example, occasionally causes serious\nabdominal distress and a blockage is always a risk.\nOh yeah, I almost forgot: what about a miracle? When she drives me to chemo every\nother week, my kind, churchgoing neighbor Janis (who's at odds with her congregation\nbecause she votes Democrat!), always ends with: \"I'm praying for a miracle.\" Then we\nboth laugh, because she knows I don't like her saying that but she, apparently, can't help\nherself. I simply say to her: \"You need to be realistic, but you can pray that I don't suffer\nmuch pain.\" A 'medical miracle?' Sure, why not? As far as the range of plausible\noutcomes go, though, this one's, as far as I'm concerned, an outlier.\nThe Drs. Patel, being the \"on the ground\" physicians, have a different perspective from\nDr. Beavis' (although they all work very well as a team): continue to treat, monitor,\n                    \nassess. At a remove from the 'big picture' (although Dr. Patel the elder has a better\nsense of the broad view than his younger colleague), they are hesitant to forecast a\nterminus.\nI was relieved to hear Dr. Beavis, who hugged me warmly and closely at the beginning\nand end of our visit, say she feels that I have done \"due diligence\" in terms of leaving no\nstone unturned.  Over the past nearly four years, I've travelled to Hopkins, Memorial\nSloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson for consults, and have had a helpful phone consult\nwith a nurse at UCLA Medical Center. I've talked with many physicians, survivors, nurses,\nfriends. I've undergone three major surgeries, including removal of a brain tumor, which\nmy doctors encouraged me to pursue to prolong my lifespan. I've been the patient and\nthe patient-advocate, a 'carer' for myself. Dr. Beavis will talk to the clinical trials team at\nHopkins one more time to make sure we haven't overlooked anything (e.g. clinical trials\nopen to participants with brain mets, which she correctly calls a 'confounding factor' in\ntrials that aim to compare 'apples to apples').\nOvarian cancer is such an insidious disease, as I've said before, the \"silent killer.\"\nHopefully, strides in research will continue to be made, but likely too late for me... I may\nwell be among the 50% of women with O.C. who don't make it past the five-year mark.\nI am not really in pain. The back of my neck is sore from radiation. My stomach can\nsuddenly be beset by discomfort, which is worrisome. I can't eat too much. I've lost\nabout nine pounds, but actually feel much better at this weight, well within normal\nrange. The chemo side effects -- nosebleeds from Avastin, neuropathy -- are annoyances.\nIn terms of \"cognition, nutrition, function,\" the trio the palliative care nurse told me he\nmonitors closely, I am not doing badly. Again, Dr. Beavis and co. were oohing and aahing\nover how well I looked and how they loved my glittery eyeshadow.\nHow do I feel emotionally? Strung\nout/overwhelmed/scared/angry/nostalgic/defensive/anxious/grateful (a bit less this week,\nbut the feeling will return)/exhausted/liberated/sad/grief-\nstricken/rushed/disappointed/embarrassed, trying to figure out my priorities and how\nbest to live my life, which is what we're all after, isn't it?\nIndeed, I felt quite overwhelmed when the palliative care nurse (a small, compact, jacked\nguy named Marc, with a shaved head and arms covered with tats), in an effort I'm sure\nto be helpful, started unfurling the laundry list of resources and 'best practices' for\nterminally ill patients: support groups/chaplaincy/penning last letters/death doulas/UCLA\nMindfulness app/medication (I was prescribed a sedative) etc. etc. My eyes were glazing\nover with so much to absorb, compounding the stress of waiting on Dr. Beavis for about\n2.5 hours (!) in a small examination room while I chatted with her fellow (Dr. Goulder)\nand Marc, the palliative care nurse, knowing too that I wanted to get on the road back to\nPA in ample daylight. Ouf!\n                    \nI asked Dr. Beavis what she thought about my travelling. She feels comfortable about my\ntaking a trip within the U.S., as she can easily connect me to medical providers just\nabout anywhere in this country (including Hawaii!) if I get sick while on the road. She\nsounded notes of caution, though, about the Caribbean and about Paris: she's not well-\nconnected there; the care (not in Paris, but elsewhere) may not be of the quality I'd find\nin the States; national health care systems can be complicated to navigate for foreigners\nwith serious illnesses. Of course, the fact that I may have said 'adieu' to Paris\npermanently is an abominable thought as my 'French' self is so central to my identity, a\nprospect hard for me to process along with many other disappointments. In fact, I don't\nthink I am very adept at 'grief work' and probably need to figure out how I'll go about it.\nRight now I'm not sure what to do about these matters except feel sad about them:\n\"Maybe [the dream deferred] just sags/like a heavy load. Or does it explode?\"\nI am most grateful to my friend Sandy for driving me to Hopkins. We actually had lots of\nlaughs realizing our conversation had largely revolved around \"diarrhea and death\" and\nthe fact that we both hate to exercise. We even indulged in some cattiness, and then felt\nbadly about it! The laughing felt so good. We made a pit stop at Alvaro's in Harrisburg\nbut arrived too early for all the pizza and pasta deliciousness so we settled for breakfast\nsandwiches and a few cookies.\nI am also hugely grateful to my college friend David, who lives in Baltimore, for driving\nme back to PA. I told David, who was my dormmate in Currier House for three years, that\nI often feel like a 'hot mess' when I see him because several times when I was in the\nmidst of crises large or small I seem to have inflicted myself on his calm, comforting\npresence. David is a therapist by training and I'm so glad that he'll soon be taking up a\npart-time therapy position  after working for Medicare for many years; I am certain that\nhe excels in this. It was a blessing that David was once again set in my path on this trip: I\nwas totally strung out from the Hopkins visit and needed to vent, process, share, seek\nadvice. I felt safe doing so with David. \"We'll journey together,\" he said. Thank you, dear\nDavid.\nD. and I also made a pit stop at Alvaro's, picking up some yummy Italian meals for\ndinner. He stayed over and left refreshed on Friday. We had plenty of time for gabbing,\nlaughing, swapping travel stories, and discovering new sides of each other.\nIt occurs to me that, should you wish to contact me, if you too wish to \"journey\ntogether,\" you might choose to do so by gmail (willazahava1@gmail.com) or text\n(814-883-6673). Honestly, if I were you, I'm not quite sure I'd know what to say to me.\nBut do know that until I'm not here, I very much am! And I'm just living my life, doing my\nthing, which this afternoon means heading off to the synagogue for a rugelach-baking\nclass. Isn't it the same for all of us? XO\n                    \nPhotos",

    "entry": "I have not written in a while. Apologies if you were concerned. There's been a lot to\nprocess, and I get tired during the day sometimes, and need to take a few short rests.\nOtherwise, I don't feel too bad. Some mild headaches, which Tylenol can fix. Reduced\nappetite and stomach discomfort from the mass in a lymph node that sits atop my\nstomach; the other night I vomited during the night, which I feared might have signaled\na blockage, but for at now at least, thankfully, it appears to be a one-off. This status quo\ncould change at any time though. Certain activities are becoming a bit harder for me. I\nworry that more severe headaches will return when/if the cancer in my brain roars back,\nand that abdominal discomfort will intensify when/if the mass increases in size,\neffectively blocking the lymph node. But so far, so good. Which makes me want to\n'frontload' all sorts of adventures, trips, experiences, while another 'little voice' tells me\nto take it easy and cocoon.\nSo I'm back to the pleasantness of local gatherings with my dear State College friends,\nbecause it makes me happy to spend time with them (and then it makes me happy to\nwrite about it): dinner at the Allen Street Grill (nicely renovated, excellent food) with\nCheryl and Sandy (always an occasion to compare clothes and jewelry with these two\nsmart, interesting women); dinner and gabfest as we like to do with Maria; abbreviated\nchats en route to chemo and back with Jackie and Janis; piping hot ramen on a cold night\nand gabbing with Helen (we have our sights set on a little jaunt to Pittsburgh later in the\nwinter; hope to see a few college friends there, food shop in the Strip district, and\nmuseum hop); and lunch with three of the \"IIICs\" (the eponymous group of women\ndiagnosed at this stage, with whom I get together every once in a while). It was, from my\nperspective, the 'best' lunch we've had in the several years that we've been meeting;\nalong with general catching up, we talked -- all pretense stripped away, and from\nexperience -- about confronting our mortality. I was particularly inspired by Deb, a\nfourteen year survivor thanks to nearly constant lines of treatment, some quite\ndebilitating (she's currently taking a break from treatment in order to prioritize 'quality of\nlife'). Despite her fatigue and significant neuropathy (both of which I can relate to), she's\ncommitted to experiences that bring her joy -- judging 4-H competitions, spending time\nwith friends and family, hosting, along with her husband, thirty-eight people (!) for\nChristmas. While I admit that I questioned Deb's mother's admonitions to her to be stoic\n(I am happy to have my feelings indulged and coddled!), I was grateful for Deb's\nexample of exuberance and strength against all odds -- envers et contre tout.\nI should never have doubted that my friends would know what to say to me, a fear I had\nexpressed in my last post. After my last Caring Bridge post, I received so many beautiful\nemails, texts and calls from people who shared personal details of their lives that I hadn't\nknown; made me intriguing, uplifting offers (trips! zoom calls! films to view! poems to\nread!); and offered support and uplift in so many different ways that I felt I was\nenveloped in a deliciously warm, comfortable blanket. I am trying to give each of these\n                    \nmessages its due in responding, and in fact have just a very few to answer, which I will\ndo in the next few days! Apologies for the delay.\nBen and Sammi's visit on Monday, after they spend Xmas with Sammi's family in\nPittsburgh, will bring more joy. We'll have a belated Chanukah celebration, with gifts,\nfood (Michael's latkes -- he dropped off a large container full of them, and they are\nalways delicious; maybe a roast chicken or pot roast, homemade apple sauce and\nrugelach), and relaxing. The plan is for us to all drive to NY on the 28th for a few days,\nbefore Ben and I drive back here on 1/2, where Ben will stay/work for a week. Plans are\nalways subject to change, though, but that's our thinking for now.\nThe holiday has been light-filled. I had hoped to attend a few Chanukah events (public\nmenorah lighting etc.), but the snow, sleet and deep freeze have kept me inside for the\npast few days (it's neg. 3 degrees right now!). Worth contemplating: the cruse of oil that\nshould have lasted for just one night when the Jews rededicated the (Second) Temple in\nJerusalem, but that burned in the Menorah for eight nights. Do you believe in miracles? I\ndo not, but yet every year I celebrate one... Also: the strength of spirit triumphing over\nmilitary might and power. The Maccabees leading the rebellion of the few over the many\n(Ukraine?), who were imposing Hellenization in the region. The light drove out the\ndarkness. \"Not by might and not by power, but by spirit alone.\" I believe in the power of\nthe spirit.\nAnd I love when Chanukah and Xmas converge.\nHave a blessed Chanukah, Christmas, Festivus, Chanamus, or (earlier this week) solstice\nday.\nMatisyahu, \"Miracle:\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dom_X7YXf8s \nP.S. I forgot to add something my wonderful chemo nurse, Tracy (who now greets me\nwith a big big hug every time I see her), said to me the other day when I had treatment:\nFocus on the \"what is\" rather than the \"what if.\" Another way of saying \"be in the\nmoment,\" \"take one day at a time,\" but somehow that 'formula' resonated with me. All of\nthe nurses in the chemo room are terrific. Everyday miracles?\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Warm wishes to you all for good health, happiness, success, fun, and contentment in in\nthe new year. Peace on earth.\nConversely, receiving greetings for a personally prosperous 2023, much as I appreciate\nthe kind sentiments and understand that exchanging them is a social ritual, feels slightly\njolting to me this year, if this is to be the year that I die. It doesn't depress me to receive\nthese greetings, it simply feels -- as does so much in cancer-land -- *weird.* At lunch\nyesterday, my friends and I were again talking about how realistic the possibility of\nmiracles might be. One of my friends puts some faith in them and that belief helps keep\nher afloat: I completely respect this. I respect the notion that different types of beliefs\nmight help some people and not others to confront challenging (health) situations. I also\nunderstand that, visualized as a bell curve, ovarian (in my case) cancer estimates\nconcerning life expectancy will cluster in one spot, at the same time as there are \n'outliers.' too. The problem for me is believing in an 'outlier' scenario for which the odds\nof success are so slim; one barely has a fighting chance at survival, although the\npossibility in extremis does exist. Perhaps I'll feel differently the more precarious my\nsituation becomes. For now, what is helping me the most to navigate these murky\nwaters (lots of monsters lurking below the surface!) is the 'one day at a time,' 'what is' v.\n'what if' philosophy. Breaking my time into 'manageable' units (days, hours, minutes)\nsomehow diminishes my fear and encourages agency within the realm of the possible.\nPhysically, I feel 'meh.' I can observe and feel a decline, but also know that I can 'rise to\nthe occasion' and that some days are better than others. I get winded easily and need to\nrest or sit down. My stomach has been hurting the past few days (a bit of vomiting that\nI'll talk to my doctor about on Tuesday, when I have chemo; reduced appetite; ability to\neat only small amounts). My very sensitive stomach did not react well to a few holiday\n'excesses,' much as I enjoyed them at the time. I'll have a CT scan of my abdomen/\nlungs/pelvis on Jan. 11th, then I'll meet with Dr. Patel on the 17th and we'll assess and\nfigure out next steps. I think I have a video meeting coming up with my palliative care\ndoctor here too. Presumably, then, I'll have my last infusion of Doxil/Avastin on Tuesday.\nI don't want to avoid talking/thinking/writing about my illness, but I also\ndon't want to ignore that part of 'aging and dying,' in the words of\npalliative care doctor B.J. Miller (whom I've mentioned before) can be --\nand is, for me -- a \"process of crescendo through to the end.\" A process of\nincreased intensity, comprised of beautiful, memorable moments, \"If we\nlove such moments ferociously,\" says Miller in his 2015 Ted Talk, \"then\nmaybe we can learn to live well \u2013 not in spite of death, but because of it.\u201d\nThe last ten days or so have been full of such ferociously-loved moments:\n                    \nOn Christmas Eve, my friend Cheryl (and her husband Jon) were kind enough to have me\nover to spend the (bitterly cold) evening with them, my friend Sandy, and her husband\nRon.  Cheryl and Jon's apartment always feels warm and inviting, with a bit of a\nsouthwestern vibe (evidence of their many stays in Santa Fe).  Cheryl is always solicitous\nand gracious (and has many other wonderful qualities). We enjoyed a bottle of Veuve\nClicquot, a delicious meal (beef Wellington) from the Hummingbird Room (I brought\nsome candied spiced pecans, from an easy yet tasty David Lebovitz recipe that has\nbecome one of my go-tos), a gorgeously decorated table, gifts, and good conversation.\nBecause it was the seventh night of Chanukah, Cheryl was glad that I brought my\nmenorah for candle-lighting, reciting the blessings, telling the story etc. The apartment\nwas aglow!\nThe day after Xmas, Ben and Sammi arrived for two days, driving from her mother's\nhome in Pittsburgh. I was so happy to see them! I had not seen Sammi since she left for\nVienna in May (or was it March?). I was able to catch up with her about how her\nexperience has evolved so far: work at the IAEA (UN-affiliated International Atomic\nEnergy Association), travel, life in Vienna, new friends etc. Over a champagne and\ncranberry shrub cocktail, we exchanged Chanukah gifts a day or two late; enjoyed, both\nnights, a pot roast I had made (Wegman's recipe: porter ensured a rich gravy), Michael's\nlatkes, my homemade applesauce, and my first take on rugelach, with Ben assisting\n(tasty dough, but most of the apricot jam, and sugary, cinnamon-y walnut mix leaked out\nduring the baking!). We ran a few errands; the two days passed quickly. I always love\nspending time with Ben and Sammi; they're a great team.  This is proving helpful to\nthem these days as they continue to navigate the aftermath of a fire in the apartment \nbelow theirs that caused some structural damage in their apartment. It appears that the\nnecessary work is being done, and the landlord is on it, but they had to buy a new bed,\nreplace some items, clean others to rid them of the smoke permeating them. A huge\nheadache, but they are handling it like pros. And most importantly, no one was hurt.\nAnother 'ferociously-loved' moment during Ben and Sammi's visit: an acquaintance\nwho's a local musician/singer (and currently an English teacher at State High), Eric,\ntexted me after we'd not been in touch in quite a while to see how I was faring. When I\nupdated him w/the recent not great health news, he asked if he could come sing for me. \nHis 'mini-concert,' performed for me, Ben and Sammi, included: Bill Withers' \"Lovely\nDay\" (which, unbeknownst to me, is one of Ben and Sammi's favorites), Marvin Gaye's\n\"What's Going On,\" some Richie Havens,  Bob Dylan, \"The Man in Me\" and one or two\nothers I can't recall. The final piece was the one I had sent Eric when I was thinking of\nturning my blog into a performance piece (an idea I've abandoned now as too ambitious\nfor my horizons, although I still give it thought...): Laura Wetzler's, \"Narrow Bridge:\"\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=laura++narrow+bridge&rlz=1C1GGRV_enFR751FR75\n1&sxsrf=ALiCzsZgSkMfVq6wmUrz_Abrl8Sptv6atg:1672620926418&source=lnms&tbm=v\nid&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9vKbB1qf8AhVrKFkFHUYCDrgQ_AUoA3oECAEQBQ&biw=1242&\n                    \nbih=568&dpr=1.1#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:c89fb4a3,vid:D3Hhky1yLkM\nThis song, inspired by the writings of Kabbalah-influenced Rabbi Nachman of Breslau\n--\"The world, in its entirety is a narrow bridge, and the most important thing is not to\ngive in to one's fear\" - and to which my blog owes its' title, is most meaningful to me. I\nwas so touched that Eric had learned and arranged it - he even sang parts of it in\nHebrew! I was riveted by his singing. I somehow let drop that I used to be a fairly adept\nguitar player, and he wanted me to pose for a pic alongside him, with my guitar.  This\nhas actually provided a bit of inspiration for me to get back to my guitar playing,\nsomething I am drawn to do every once and again.\nIt was indeed a \"lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day.\"\nBen, Sammi and I drove to the city on Wednesday. Thursday I took my brother and\nnephew Isaac to Friend of a Farmer for a relaxed, lovely brunch and chat; the weather\nhad warmed up considerably and we walked a few blocks in the sunshine, stopping to\ntake a selfie or two to remember the day. In the afternoon, my friend Kay and her\nhusband Jeff came to visit at my mom's, followed by coffee nearby.  I am so grateful that\nI've gotten to see Kay -- my girlhood friend, college dormmate, and retired Prof. of\nEnglish at UC Santa Barbara -- several times, in State College, NY, and hopefully in some\nwarm spot, ripe for self-indulgence, before long. And I am delighted that our nearly same\nage only sons also met recently, and hit it off. Kay and I had lost contact for several\nyears, or rather had remained connected by the barest of threads (biannual emails on\nour respective birthdays). I love her insightfulness, quirkiness, kindness, and sense of\nfun. I don't think we've exhausted (scarcely) discovering all we have in common; at the\nsame time, we have a long history and shared memories that form the base of a\npowerful bond. Kay's husband (also our college classmate), Jeff, is a neurologist, and\nseemed eager to help answer some of my brain mets related questions. I loved my visit\nwith them 'ferociously.' :\nA Part II is coming after I return to State College. I hope this post doesn't seem trivial --\nyou may well not wish to wade through a blow by blow account of my comings and\ngoings and doings -- but I somehow felt I wanted a record of this crescendo-like year's\nend.\n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "Thank you for the many uplifting new year's messages! And for some meaningful gifts,\nsuch as a personalized Spotify playlist (so thoughtful). I am responding to each message\nbut, as usual with me, it's taking a bit of time. Further, yesterday I was completely\nknocked out after receiving my final Covid booster, and slept most of the day! My\napologies for being late w/some responses!\nI am still not feeling great. My digestive system seems to be the culprit. Stomach\ndiscomfort kept me awake part of last night. I have nearly chronic indigestion, some\nnausea, frequent hiccupping. I really can't eat much without feeling distress; have lost\nabout 13 lbs.. Believe it or not, I am actually looking forward to my CT-scan on\nWednesday so my doctors can figure out what's going on and determine how best to\ntreat it.\nMy palliative care doc, Nikki Vithalani, w/whom I met with on Friday via videoconf.,\nsuggested Maalox for relief so I'll try that. She also shared something I didn't know: brain\nradiation can cause extreme fatigue, of the type I've been experiencing. To combat this,\nto jolt me with some energy, doctors, she said, sometimes prescribe Ritalin (?!). To me,\nRitalin has scary connotations, but we'll see what my medical team advises. Finally,\nbecause I don't have much stamina these days, Nikki suggested I get more help to assist\nme with daily tasks. While Abby picks up my groceries and helps out around the house\nonce a week, and while I have my house cleaned every other week, I probably could use\nanother two hours a day from someone, mainly to wash dishes/straighten my kitchen,\nmake my bed, pick up groceries, and take care of assorted odds and ends around the\nhouse. I even had an anxiety dream in which my living space was being invaded by mess\n(clothes on the floor etc.) I'm going to start working on this.\nI wanted to leave a record of the remainder of my trip to the city: On Wednesday (30\nDec.), I took my mother out for a belated bday lunch at Gramercy Tavern. The walk from\nmy mother's apartment on 17th st. past Gramercy Park where I grew up to the Tavern on\n20th bore me along on gusts of memory, archeological strata from the different 'eras' of\nmy life. There was 24 Gramercy Park, where my acquaintance Ross lived, a handsome,\nslightly older boy who occasionally hung out with my group of neighborhood friends on\nwarm summer nights in the park, to which a key provided access; and the Gramercy Arts\nClub, where I took piano lessons for many years with Mrs. Kay Fryer, who rewarded me\nfor good work with small statuettes of the great composers, and held annual recitals that\nalways paralyzed me with performance anxiety; and, at 34 Gramercy Park East, the\nbuilding where I grew up! A stately 1883 red brick structure in the Queen Anne style.\nWhen I would leave for school in the morning, the ornate entryway provided a\npicturesque frame for the park across the street - snow-covered in winter, blooming in\nthe spring, lush and green in summer, infused with the weather and smells that\naccompanied each season. I never tired of that pretty view.\n                    \nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/gramercy-park/the-gramercy-34-gramercy-park-\neast/4850\nGramercy Tavern is an iconic New York restaurant that I had been to once before\nperhaps twenty years ago, with Michael and his family. I might describe its style as 'haut\nam\u00e9ricain' or maybe New American (although not so new anymore). The service is\ndistinctive: consummately professional yet also somewhat casual. Our waiter (in slacks,\napron, and a crisp man-tailored shirt with sleeves rolled up) inquired at length about food\nallergies (which turned out to be necessary in my mother's case) yet also joked around\nwith us. I remember being struck by that style, which I don't think you'd encounter in a\nFrench restaurant of the same caliber, the first time I tried GT. Following a glass of\nProsecco, we opted for the three-course \"Greenmarket Lunch,\" featuring the outstanding\nproduce from the Union Square Greenmarket down the street. I had a delicious celeriac\n(a new taste for me) soup; it tasted so rich I thought it had cream in it but it only\nfeatured a bit of butter (there was an amuse-bouche too, but I forget what it was). For\nour main dish we both had grilled skate, perfectly cooked (I usually give credit only to\nFrench restaurants for cooking fish so beautifully) on top of a bed of mini greenmarket\nveggies and surrounded by some sort of delicious coulis. For dessert, we split a\ncheesecake (small, oval-shaped) w/a ball of clementine (?) sorbet, and some fresh pear\nsorbet. Excellent coffee. And a small bowl of the most perfect, flavorful Concord grapes\nto finish. The portions were rather small and I ate very slowly so fortunately the meal did\nnot bother my stomach. I'm glad that we sat in the (quiet!) main dining room rather than\nthe bustling tavern/bar area up front, where patrons were eating appetizing looking\nhamburgers grilled on a wood fire, among other more casual dishes.\nThe year ended wonderfully, as I spent part of the day with two of my best friends from\ngrade school, Eva and Zia. I met Zia (a writer, who also teaches writing at the New\nSchool) at a store we had wanted to visit since I had read a NYTimes article about it: the\nNew York branch of Sabayasachi (https://sabyasachi.com/password). The designer\nSabayasachi is credited with having 'reinvented the sari' largely (but not exclusively) for\na wealthy Indian-American (in the case of the NY boutique) clientele (if you're a sucker\nfor reality shows, as I am [!], check out \"Indian Weddings\"). All we could say on entering\nthe boutique (way west on Christopher St.) through massive teak (?) doors is that we felt\nwe were in another world, in a beyond opulent d\u00e9cor featuring Indian tapestries, objects,\ncalligraphy; lots of chinoiserie; vases, porcelain, furniture that would not be out of place\nat Versailles; dozens of crystal chandeliers; elegantly-bound editions of literary classics\n(Voltaire) plus colonial-era literature (Kipling). Within this fantasy environment, the\nwedding clothing, pashminas, jewelry -- all highly ornate -- are displayed. There were a\nfew customers (mainly Indian and Indian-American) trying on wedding clothing; I frankly\nthought the clothing looked a bit more 'glitzy' than it does on Sabayaschi's Instagram. I\nthought I might buy myself a scarf but the prices were prohibitive. The staff, however,\nwas lovely (the manager seemed like he might be Indian but told us he was half-Middle\nEastern, half-Danish) and let us spend quite a while there, visitors at a museum. There is\n                    \nlikely a sociological angle to this place and the entire upscale Indian wedding industry,\nI'm sure; perhaps Zia will be able to parse it, as she and her mom Madhur are definitely\nbetter attuned to Indian culture than I am. We certainly had fun gawking!\nWe headed towards Zia's mother and stepfather's house on W. 12th street -- another jolt\nfrom the past as this is the same apartment where I spent *hours* as a teenager and pre-\nteen, sleeping over in the bedroom Zia shared with her two sisters; locking ourselves in\nthe bathroom when we wanted to have gossipy conversations; sometimes sleeping on\nthe floor in the living room, on a bed of comfy pillows and blankets. Zia's parents weren't\nhome, but let us use the apartment for the delightful lunch that Zia prepared. Eva (who\nlives in Sag Harbor, LI, with her husband Drew, and currently works in insurance) arrived\nand, over lunch and a glass of Pinot Grigio, we had a great conversation that seemed to\nroam between past and present, milestones and challenges (marriages, relationships,\nillness, aging parents), sprinkled with whatever wisdom we've picked up over the years.\nLots of laughs. I had brought the diary I kept the summer of 1974 (we were all 15), which\ncaptured so many vignettes from that summer featuring the three of us, like a sweltering\nsummer evening when about a dozen of us classmates hung out at the San Gennaro\nstreet fair in Little Italy, intoxicated by the smell of sizzling Italian sausage and onions\nand zeppoli, the lights of the city, and the unsurpassed feeling of independence.\nNew Year's Eve I stayed in and made dinner (linguine with a lemon cream sauce) for my\nmother and Arnold, to go with our Veuve Clicquot! I was so tired I didn't even make it to\nmidnight. \nBen and I drove back to State College on 1/2. He teleworked here and helped me out for\nthe week. He was a darling in every way, and I really appreciated (and needed) his help.\nHe's headed to Boulder, CO, soon to visit his friend Nolan while he works from there. The\nguys will do lots of skiing, I'm sure.\n \n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "I don't have much of a medical update to share. I am *still* awaiting results of the CT-\nscan (pelvis/abdomen/lungs) I had last Wednesday, which I am supposed to discuss with\nDr. Patel tomorrow morning in order to assess my condition and develop a treatment\nplan. I've left three messages with Dr. Patel's office today to see if they can\naccess/expedite the report and have also called Geisinger's Radiology department. Very\nfrustrating. I also need to write a letter to Aetna after receiving an astronomical bill for\nmy last two chemo treatments, from Nov. and Dec. 2022. I had apparently maxed out\nmy coverage for these treatments, but of course I was never alerted to this. I don't\nbelieve this cap was even mentioned in the Explanation of Benefits I received. Grrrr! So\nfrustrating.\nIf only I had my usual energy to throw myself full throttle into combatting these two\nproblems, which must be resolved. The first one will likely resolve itself, but I may not\nhave the results of the CT-scan before I talk to Dr. Patel tomorrow, unfortunately. The\nsecond problem - battling the insurance company, appealing the charge -- will require\nstamina, focus and determination, all of which I have historically prided myself on. But\nI've not been feeling well for a few weeks, and this makes routine (and less routine)\n                    \ntasks arduous to perform. I find myself (still) very tired, winded, and lacking  appetite.\nI'm consuming only liquids now, but trying to bulk up with milkshakes, Carnation instant\nbreakfast, soup etc. Have lost about 15 pounds, and should not lose much more. My PCP,\nPaul Damaske, whom I saw on Friday (very compassionate guy, who's keeping close\ntrack of me along with my other doctors here) attributed much of how I'm feeling to -\nsimply - cancer. After nearly four years of treatment, my body is tired. Some of my\n'systems' (e.g. digestive) may be slowing down. Radiation also causes fatigue. He gave\nme another med, Protonix, for my stomach/digestive issues, and I also started taking\nsomething like Maalox that my palliative care doctor proposed. Hoping for another\n\"honeymoon period.\"\n[Update on my update: Dr. Patel's office just wrote. They said they had called the\nradiologist, who promised to write his report for Dr. Patel to read before I see him\ntomorrow morning. Whew. Problem #1 solved].[Update #2: I see that the radiologist's\nreport has been uploaded to my portal. But now I'm too scared to read it. I may wait for\nDr. Patel to parse it for me tomorrow morning].\nI feel the impulse to censor or 'curate' my medical update as I am conscious of not\nwanting to concern, even alarm, those reading this entry.\nVisits with friends have definitely provided cheer over the past few weeks. My friends\nJackie and Monique came for tea on consecutive days, Monique bearing a large container\nof homemade chicken soup (she's been supplying me with this 'Jewish penicillin' at\ncritical junctures ever since I was in the hospital after Ben was born nearly twenty-eight\nyears ago!). The day after Jackie's visit, she insisted on hand delivering a mocha chip\nmilkshake from Meyer's Dairy (liquid goodness, I indulged in a chocolate root beer float\ntoday) and Wegman's OMG Tomato Soup (I'm clueless about the name). Have also\nzoomed with my grade school friend Jane, who recently sold her house on Cape Cod and\nmoved to Hawaii (her invitation to visit is tempting....); my former grad student turned\ncolleague and good friend, Denis; and, this evening, my cousin. In touch with other\nfriends via text, email etc. Ben is in Boulder, Colorado for a few weeks, teleworking and\nskiing and hanging out with friends and otherwise 'livin' the life,' but we're in touch every\nday. He loves it there!\nWhitman in I Sing the Body Electric: \"I have learned that to be with those I like is\nenough.\"\n__________________________________________________________________________________\nOver the many years I taught French \"civilization\" (we now opt for the far less\n'imperialistic' and historically more accurate moniker of \"culture and society\"), I always\nlooked forward to teaching the sessions on \"Visions de la mort au Moyen Age\" (Visions of\nDeath in the Middle Ages). Why? Objects such as memento mori or frescoes in\nchurchyards depicting the danse macabre, seemed so alien to me and my students in\n                    \ntheir strangeness, underscoring the 'pastness of the past.' This topic would never fail,\nalso, to generate interesting discussions (in French!) on topics ranging over Goth culture,\nthe AIDS quilt, celebrations of life, depictions of death in popular culture (today, I'm\ncertain that COVID and its fallout would be in the mix as well, considered in parallel with\nthe Black Plague; I remember in the very early days of COVID, around March 2020, I had\na dream in which a black-robed, masked, plague-doctor appeared!).\nI'm not sure where I want to go with this musing. I'm too lazy (and likely not well-\ninformed enough) to take on a full-fledged comparison of 'images of and attitudes\ntowards death in the Middle Ages and today.' That would truly be an undertaking\ndoomed to failure.  I think I simply want to say that those discussions, and those images,\nhave stayed with me, and have much greater resonance for me now. I wonder if any of\nthe students in my classes had experienced death closely enough (within their families\nor among friends, for example) to be moved (or even traumatized) by these images?\nWhen I taught them, it was always at an intellectual remove.\nHow does one 'die well,' as various illustrated tracts from the 15th century onwards\nasked (or rather advised)? In the Middle Ages, the Ars Moriendi, likely written by\nchurchmen, were treatises prescribing behaviors constituting a 'good death.' In the\ncontext of the times, this meant a death preceded by an upright Christian life and ending\nwith the passage of body and soul to heaven, after angels and devils warred over the\nmortal flesh until the very end (this was graphically, and sometimes gruesomely,\ndepicted in woodcuts accompanying the text). One can surmise that the ultimate end of\nsuch treatises was to reinforce the power of the Church and encourage obedience. They\nultimately functioned as technologies of control and discipline.\nAnd what of today? I just ordered B.J. Miller's new book, The Beginner's Guide to the End,\nwhose approach, as I understand it, is eminently practical; one chapter is entitled \"How\nto write a eulogy and an obituary.\" A good death, in Miller's vision, might be one in which\nall the practical matters of dying (paying for the funeral, writing the obituary, choosing\nburial options etc.) are dispensed with expertly. But my attention and imagination shift,\nfor the moment, to Georges Montorgeuil's fanciful vision of revelers high above\nMontmartre, tutelar spirits inhabiting this magical place. They float joyfully, perhaps\nheaded not so much 'up' but out, into a vaporous sky, free, holding hands and kicking up\ntheir heels. I guess I'd like to think of a 'good death' not as the fearful vision of the Ars\nmoriendi but something akin to Montorgeuil 'vie \u00e0 Montmartre,' devoid of acute bodily\nsuffering, joyful in having lived well, free-floating.\n[I think my train of thought is not yet well-developed here, but these images have been\non my mind lately!]\nPhotos",

    "entry": "I was too tired and stressed to write anything on Monday or Tuesday as I awoke\nextremely early both days for bloodwork, magnesium infusion, meeting with Dr. Patel,\nvitamin B-12 injection etc. After having slept twelve hours last night (which seems to be\nwhat I need these days), I'm able to provide an update.\n                    \nI'm afraid the update may seem 'anticlimactic' as it certainly didn't convey any news I\ndidn't expect, except for that of a new spot on my liver (about 1 cm+ in size; will be\ntargeted by my next course of chemo). Progression of disease, totally expected. The\ncancer progresses gradually, and is now present in my lymph nodes, on my liver, in my\nbrain and likely elsewhere (a few tumors at the base of my abdomen). The mass in the\nlymph node *behind* my stomach (I actually thought it lay on top of my stomach) is\nquite sizeable. I haven't actually read the report yet (but will); Dr. Patel interpreted it for\nme, and I'll ask Dr. Beavis about it, too.\nI asked if radiating the mass in my lymph node was possible; Dr. Patel said that, because\nof the location of the lymph node, radiating it would entail piercing through other organs\nand healthy tissue, a much too toxic option.\nDr. Patel, unfortunately, does not have a definitive explanation of my recent symptoms\n(fatigue, lack of appetite and weight loss, stomach discomfort). He ruled out organ\nfunction (my liver, kidney functioning normally) and low hemoglobin, platelet, or white\nblood cell count (these are ok as well). The stomach discomfort might be due to a partial\nblockage (which we'll only worry about if I'm vomiting chronically, which I'm not); the\nfatigue can be partially attributed to the chemo drugs and radiation. Stress could\ncertainly cause or accentuate all these symptoms. Dr. Patel had another theory that had\nto do with magnesium and metabolism but 'llI have to look at my notes for the details. I\nnow have a small cornucopia of meds targeting my digestion, nausea etc. I will take\nthem all, simultaneously, and see if that helps.\nI might try a low dose of Ritalin for an energy boost.\nI need to maintain my weight and not lose more; today it seems to be stable (lots of\nmilkshakes and Carnation instant breakfast!).\nOne piece of good news, per Dr. Patel: my symptoms do not signal the stage\nimmediately preceding death (LOL - three cheers for small victories!). Am I happy to be\nhere? Without a doubt.\nAnother piece of good news: for *now* (but this can change quickly) my head/brain are\n'behaving.' I'm fearful of a 'double whammy' (brain stuff + all the rest), but so far I've\nmanaged to stave this off. Brain MRI in about a month and a half.\nGood news #3: both Dr. Patel and his nurse feel I look quite well, belying the seriousness\nof my condition.\nWe are next (and perhaps finally?) going to try a chemo drug I've not been given before,\ncalled Alimta (Pemetrexid), along with Avastin. I need to talk to Dr. Beavis and find out\n                    \nwhy they wish to continue w/Avastin, if the previous treatments with it have not worked\nor worked well. Avastin gives me nosebleeds, and I always worry about the risk of bowel\nperforation. If I do decide to go ahead with this combo (of course, I could stop, or could\nhave stopped, treatment at any point, such as before my brain surgery, in which case I'd\nbe dead by now but would have avoided some of the real discomfort I'm experiencing\ncurrently), I'll be infused every three weeks. It's all about balancing my quality of life\nagainst the effects, and effectiveness, of the treatment. At the moment, my quality of\nlife seems to have taken a dip, but again: am I glad to be here, driving in my car\nlistening to NPR, picking up a milkshake at Meyer's Dairy, chatting with store clerks,\nenjoying the mundanities of living? Absolutely!\nMay be making some progress on getting additional help around the house, which I\nsorely need. Something like 1-2 hours a day, every day, and we'll see how it goes after\nthat. \nWhile I never like to plan too far in advance these days, I'm still hoping my beloved grad\nschool friends will arrive in late Jan. on what we're calling the \"spoil her rotten express\"\nfor a weekend of laughs and silliness and pampering. \nAlso have tentatively planned five days of pool, a sparkling bay, spa, lounging and *sun*\nwith another dear friend in early Feb. - if things remain stable. I think it will do me good.\nCan you guess where we're headed (no spoilers, for the two or three of you who know!)?",

    "entry": "Health report: status quo, i.e. 'new normal,' i.e. fatigue, shortness of breath on even\nrelatively mild exertion, discomfort in my stomach/abdominal area, decreased appetite\nand preference for liquids (maintaining weight loss of about 14 lbs.; plenty of milk\nshakes, root beer floats [thank you, Lisa, for bringing me one today!], Carnation instant \nbreakfast and some soft foods like bananas). I can't really say I'm in pain, although if I\neat the wrong thing, I experience cramping or other discomfort in my stomach. My\n(in)digestion is wonky.\nVery happy to be here, it goes without saying. In fact, I have taken offense, or been\ntaken aback, or taken...somewhere where alarm bells are ringing, when, for the first\ntime, two of my doctors recently addressed the issue of my stopping treatment. My\npalliative care doc, Dr. Vithalani, asked me point blank if I wanted to pursue the next line\nof treatment. I know, of course, that the choice is always mine, but somehow the\npossibility never occurred to me as a real option, one that I would consider seriously. She\nsuggested that while stopping treatment might shorten my lifespan (further), it might\nalso improve the quality of the life I have left (off chemo for several weeks now while\nawaiting insurance pre-certification for Alimta, I have indeed been feeling better,\nalthough spending time with friends is really the elixir that energizes me and lifts my\nspirits; I felt that today over lunch at a newish ramen place in town with my friend Helen,\nwho dazzled me with stories of her recent trip to Israel, a country that enthralled me\nwhen I visited, and also on Monday, when Kathryn, Sandy, and Cheryl came over for\nconvo and...milkshakes! Am greatly looking forward to the arrival tomorrow of Vinni,\nShanny and Isa, my dear grad school friends, for two days of giggles and various\nindulgences). Dr. Beavis also suggested yesterday that I might try the new chemo drug,\nAlimta (Pemetrexid), see how I react to it, and discontinue it if it doesn't sit well with me.\nStopping treatment is of course a scary prospect. Feels like free fall. Even if I'm receiving\nthe chemo somewhat prophylactically, I still have some notion (illusion?) of control over\nmy disease as long as I'm in treatment. But we're not at the critical juncture yet. Dr.\nBeavis has mentioned one final (?) line of (post-Alimta) treatment, for which I would have\nto have my tumor tested and for which there also appears to be a national shortage of a\nnecessary reagent. I'm not feeling terribly optimistic about this possibility.\nI am still haggling with Aetna over an astronomical bill for two chemo treatments. And\nnow I am also somewhat haggling with Dr. Patel's office over whether or not he will write\na letter in support of my appeal. Decidedly, this is not bringing me joy.\n                    \nWhat is leaving me more time for whatever brings me joy is the additional home help\nI've  been able to arrange through sheer force of will(apower) - and with a big thanks to\nMaria. I now have one of three very nice women coming in *every day* for 1-2 hours to\ndo a mix of cleaning/straightening/groceries/errands (nothing medical); I'm also\nengaging them in a big downsizing/organizing effort throughout my house, an\nundertaking that, admittedly, may take a while but that is making me feel,\npsychologically and emotionally, much happier -- which leads me to my recent dreams.\nTHEMES\n'Living in the material world\u2026'\n'The things they carried.' What we take with us v. what we leave behind\u2026\nUnfinished business.\nGoing on a journey and nothing must be left behind, unaccounted for. On the other hand,\nonce it\u2019s all packed, everything must be left behind.\n\"Don\u2019t leave a mess\" (Miller and Berger, _A Beginner\u2019s Guide to the End_; guess I flunked\nthat chapter :{)\nFeeling overwhelmed; events and phenomena over which I have little to no control, yet I\nstill try to control them (flailing all the while). Maybe the key is to relinquish control and\nhave faith that everything will be alright.\nDREAMS\nI've essentially had the same dream every night for the past several weeks: I have to\npack up, clean up etc. for a trip or move of some sort. It's a monumental job and\neverything's a mess. Meanwhile, there's lots of other activity going on: sometimes it\u2019s an\nactivity I\u2019d much rather be pursuing (like swimming in an enticing ocean), other times it\u2019s\nanother major responsibility I have to acquit, and I\u2019m not really succeeding at anything!\nSnapshots:\nPacking, huge mess of clothes strewn everywhere. Do I have enough space in my\nsuitcases, do I even have enough suitcases? (In another dream: suitcases bulging, I'm\ntrying to push them up onto some kind of overhead rack as on a train, with difficulty).\nIn one bin of stuff to pack: some pretty, small framed prints and artifacts from late 19th\nc? Old. But one was contained in a gaudy, bling-y frame with the name \u201cGucci\"\nprominently spelled out in rhinestones.\n                    \nIn the midst of all this frantic packing  \u2013 other people around \u2013 I decide to take a shower\nand wash my hair (light switches to turn on overhead lights in shower don\u2019t work). I\u2019m\ntaking the shower but know that I have much else to take care of, including the packing.\nI\u2019m starting to get tired.\nI have a class to teach (recurring theme in many of my dreams). I\u2019m barely keeping it\n(the class) together. This one concerns the Belle Epoque. The session I\u2019m supposed to\ncover that day centers on posters and graphic art in general, a subject I know well. I\nrealize that I can simplify things for myself by simply asking the class: Why is this era\ncalled \u201cL\u2019\u00e2ge du papier?\u201d I\u2019m glad to have hit on this idea because I realize that the\nquestion will get us into the subject of technology and its importance. But I also realize\nthat I\u2019m barely on top of this class. There appears to be an essay due soon or a big test\nthat I\u2019m supposed to make everyone aware of, but I\u2019m clueless. There\u2019s an undercurrent\nof (my) worry about this important fact.\nRelated: I'm showing up for the last class session of a course in which I had hardly made\nan appearance all semester. Much to my surprise, a few of the students actually show\nup; I think they want to get their homework assignments returned after waiting nearly all\nsemester. Did this take place in the old NBS (my grade/high school) building? And I think\nstudents from this class were combined with those (in the same room) of another one I\nwas teaching.\nMany tasks to take care of, confusion, fatigue, feeling overwhelmed. Have to send\nsomething in the mail but it becomes very complicated because I don't have an\nenvelope, nor perhaps a stamp. Go out looking for these, need to walk very far; some of\nthe route completely unfamiliar (buildings in a city I do not recognize; I seem not to be\ntaking the most direct route). Then I somehow realize I am near NYU (my graduate\nschool alma mater) and find Bobst Library. Get to Bobst Library, speak with a janitor or\nhandyman who implies he can get me an envelope but this turns out to be complicated (I\nneed to wait for the envelope/stamp, or go somewhere else to get it).\nI am staying \u201cat my mother and father\u2019s\u201d for the summer. I am recounting this to\nsomeone on the phone, sort of unhappily. Is it our old apartment in Gramercy Park\n(where I lived most of my life, at least on and off, from age 6-mid 20s)? This apartment,\nat least, is neat and very quiet, contrasting with the chaos of the rest of the dream.\nI thought I had cleaned up a huge mess that we (+ other people, family members?) had\nto take care of before leaving the premises of an apartment that belonged to someone\nelse (perhaps we had rented it). Then I realize there's *much more* to clean out/pack up\nthan I had first imagined -- entire shelves and closets bulging with stuff. One of these\nspaces looks like my spice cabinet. I suggest putting each jar of spices/herbs in a plastic\nbag and sealing it, but someone (my mother?) thinks it will attract bugs. There are also\nhalf-used bottles of vinegar, oils etc. I don't know what to do with them. There's so much\n                    \nstuff, everywhere! I feel totally overwhelmed. I think the part about being in my mother\nand father\u2019s calm apartment (above) was actually the last part of the dream.\nMom seems younger in the dream, as do mom and dad in Gramercy Park \u2013 an earlier era\nof my life.\nAllen E. (former therapist) in dream. He\u2019s mad at me because I\u2019ve somehow \u2018messed up\u2019\nwith therapy, perhaps neglected to attend group sessions, done something wrong. He\nappears stern and chastising, and I feel sheepish and flustered. In another part of that\ndream (which was part of larger dream), a young boy (either little Ben or Ethan or\namalgam) and I are in AE\u2019s presence to do some therapy work. The boy has some\nrecrimination of me that he wishes to express (although not meanly or angrily, just\npretty matter-of-factly) but I preempt him by saying what *I* think is going wrong in our\ndynamic, ie my and the boy's>grammar??). I start speaking rather loudly and\nassertively, depriving the boy of the opportunity to speak.\nLast night: Yes, as in all the dreams, mess is omnipresent. But somehow I'm able to fish\nout an outfit that I put on: a turtleneck or cowl neck gray cashmere-like form-fitting\nsweater and a black skirt. I look at my profile and think I look quite attractive; the weight\nloss flatters me. I also put on some blingy sparkly earrings with matching necklace. Am a\nbit disappointed as it's not the blingy necklace I had expected to wear but a nice yet\nsimple silver chain with small horseshoes dangling from it. My hair is about shoulder\nlength and looks good. Pretty sure action in this dream also takes place in our Gramercy\nPark apartment!\nNext, I am in bathroom of this apartment and see something pushing up from under the\nfloor. I expect it might be a groundhog but it is a cat! It is gray (mottled), has matted\nhair, semi-closed eyes, and looks like it's 'been through the wringer.\" I pick up cat and\ntake it next door to bedroom (my old bedroom in the apartment!) to give to little Ben (or\nEthan?), who is in bed. The cat escapes from Ben's hands, however, and somehow finds\nanother hole in the floor of the room that s/he falls into or escapes through. The cat is\ngone. [IRL: My neighbors Paul and Marcia have sent two emails to the other condo\nowners in our complex to let us know their cat, Luther, is missing; I have been worried\nabout this].\nWhy all the concern w/'stuff' in the dreams while seemingly less concern about people\n(taking or leaving them). Does the 'stuff' represent the people? Is my overconcern with\nthe 'stuff' obscuring my tending to my people? Paging Dr. Freud...\nREADS\nCarl Hiassen, _Squeeze Me_ [thanks, Steve!] (a *welcome* change of pace from some of\nthe heavier stuff I've been reading/thinking/feeling/living these days, a satirical mystery\n                    \nset in Trump-era south Florida; it made me laugh!);Ross Gay, _The Book of Delights_\n[thanks, Paula!] - some of the author's 'delights' are a bit arcane (for me), others not (the\npleasure of saying 'whatevs' whenever possible!), but the style is original and\ncompelling. I enjoyed this book of 'essayettes;' Joan Didion, _The Year of Magical\nThinking_ (thanks, Maria!) Oh my. Please everyone read this book.  So perceptive about\nhow grief unfolds, about its many layers, its relationship to the past, present, and future,\nits 'vortices.' Didion's spare style, her sense for the telling detail, the permission she\ngives herself to be so intimate, so vulnerable in her writing. I love this book; BJ Miller and\nS. Berger, _The Beginner's Guide to the End: Practical Advice for Living Life and Facing\nDeath_. I ordered this book because I'm a huge fan of B.J. Miller's and am open to\nreceiving 'practical advice' in the same way I was when I read _What to Expect when\nyou're Expecting._ So 21st century America, I know, a 'how-to' guide for dying (cf my\npost on the _Ars moriendi,_ above)! I've just dipped into it but can tell that it's about\nmuch more than practicalities: spirituality, relationships, ritual. Interesting and ultimately\nhelpful stuff.",
    "comments": "Fingers crossed about Alimta, Willa! Loved the memories from the Gramecy Park\napartment. I think that, with your newly found help, you are actually addressing the\n\"stuff\", so relax and enjoy your friends' visit. On another note, recently I was reminded of\na 1990s film that takes place in the Bastille area and which I loved: Chacun cherche son\nchat (yes, a cat is lost in it for a while but all ends well). You may know it. It should be\navailable at Pattee, and it'll bring a laugh. Big hugs - M\n  \u2014Monique Yaari, January 27, 2023  \nDear Willa, thank you deeply for sharing with us your intimate life journey at this point\n(and as always, so eloquently). It's like living an alternate reality - to a degree, my (our?)\nown futures, except that mine will undoubtedly be less replete with friends and\nsupporters. I am, of course, sorry to hear of the \"new normal\" of your impaired physical\nexperience, but fervently hope you may coast at that level (and sans pain) for a very\nlong time. I am exhilarated to see you continuing to seize every morsel of delight, every\njoy in friendship, every glimpse of beauty, despite losses. You are certainly following\nRonsard's \"ceuillez, ceuillez...\" injunction and in so doing, inspiring me in my very\ndifferent circumstances.\n                    \nAll the above being true of your on-going joie de vivre, then of COURSE you should\ncontinue treatments as long as they reward you with potential time-extension and that\nall-important sense of control, the second - certain - being the more important and\nprobably contributing to the first. Very glad to hear of your domestic help and the\npossibility that new medicines may help. Such a shame you have to spend precious time\nand energy battling Aetna!\nWhat incredible dream recall you have! The only meaning I'm sure of, is that one way or\nanother, all are classic anxiety dreams (wonder why, duh!). Also, that your brain is\nclearly entirely functional - otherwise you couldn't remember your dreams in such\nsensory detail.\nShabbat Shalom, comrade!\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, January 27, 2023  \nHuge hugs, Willa, and gratitude for sharing your journey xo\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, January 27, 2023  \nI'm wondering, like Monique, if the dreams reflect retrospectively the mess you are now\nleaving behind by having helpers come in on a daily basis. Maybe part of you wonders if\nyou'll miss the mess -- but I doubt that! How wonderful that you may soon be able to\ntake Alimta -- go for it!! Love, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, January 27, 2023  \nThat might be part of it, but I'm certain there's something more existential there...\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, January 27, 2023  \nThe Year of Magical Thinking was a big help to me, at a stressful time. Insights into the\nway the brain processes impressions at its own strange pace.\n  \u2014Christopher Walker, January 27, 2023  \nThank you, darling. A few years into bless\u00e8d retirement, I dreamed I was lecturing while\ntaking a shower. Conveniently, there was a shower on the podium.\n  \u2014Jim Davis, January 28, 2023  \nYes, we grasp every moment of delight, every joy in friendship, every glimpse of beauty,\nmay such blessings continue to enliven you divinely! With high hopes for Alimta! XOXO\n                    \n  \u2014Marianne Freed, January 28, 2023  \nI am sending you so many loving thoughts Willa!\n  \u2014Paula Golombek, January 30, 2023  \nThank you, Paula! I finally read Ross Gay, and loved his book of delights!

I hope I have helped take care of them.\nI wish days like these would never end. Nourishment for the soul, mind and body.

My pals of a half-century. How we've\nchanged, how we've remained the same, what the journey's been like. I open a yearbook\nor one of my diaries and see us there, in our blue pleated skirts, white blouses and knee\nsocks, our innocent images belying all the mischief we were up to, all the longings,\ncuriosity, and at times inner chaos of our teenage years in NY.\n*****\nAnd Monday, if all goes as planned (still a bit nervous about jinxing myself), I'll fly\ntowards warmer climes for five days of poolside relaxation, spa indulgences, and\n                    \nwhatever hijinks my dear friend Kay (whom I've know the longest of all, since we met\none summer when we were twelve in Amherst, MA, as castmates in a production of _The\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer_ ) has dreamed up for us.\n****\nI remember that when I was little my cousins gave me a book entitled _A Friend is\nSomeone who Likes You,_ by Joan Walsh Anglund.

Miller is calling it again: \"I am asking we make space so that aging\nand dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.\"\nP.S. I did a thing. I had my hair, skimpy as it is, cut and colored for the first time in\nseveral years.  This is the second time my hair has grown back since I was diagnosed in\n2019.

Now if they would just get rid of that scary governor...\nAt the Mandarin Oriental (henceforward MO), the staff smiles, pampers, coddles, flirts,\nbrings you cucumber and lemon water by the pool, fixes a tropical fruit salad of dragon\nfruit and pineapple, squeezes fresh orange juice, concocts the most beautiful purple\ncocktail: Prosecco, hibiscus, elderflower liqueur; calms you with meditation and\nvisualization in a room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking glistening Biscayne Bay;\nsoftly plays Burt Bacharach tunes for you in the lounge.\nCurling up in a soft towel for a rest by the infinity pool or feeling my body absorb the\nsun's enlivening rays; jacuzzi. Restful sleeps.\nSpa time: smells divine (vaguely woodsy and leathery); tea ritual on arrival (rejuvenating\ncool hibiscus tea, on a tray with warm towels and vibrantly colored fresh blossoms);\nfluffy robes, slippers; facial (masque, creams, peels, exfoliants, lip balm, heat, cool,\ngentle massage); manicure (I brought one of my favorite OPI shades, \"Princesses Rule!);\naromatherapy steam room (feel the pores open, the body exude moisture covering you\nin rivulets); visualization (I am encased in an aqua blue, green and pink cocoon, floating\nhigh above); deep breathing; shower (hot water pummeling you from all sides, rosemary-\nscented bath gel); feeling so pleasantly in touch with my body, for the moment no longer\na source of pain.\nFood: dinner two nights at La Mar, the hotel restaurant, Peruvian with some Asian fusion.\nSat outside overlooking the glittery (glitzy?) Miami skyline. Bustling place, bustling city.\nLots of ceviche: octopus, calamari, prawns, scallops, tuna marinated in lime, sometimes\ntamarind, cilantro and other deliciousness. Empanadas. Mojitos! Pisco sours! Dulce de\nleche, tres leches cake w/banana.\nOther night ventured 'off campus' to Cafe La Trova in Little Havana. Food maybe a B+\n(tried something with lime-marinated pork and pineapple rice; prawns w/white beans in a\nbrown sauce), drinks A+ (some sort of amazing frozen Campari concoction). Atmosphere\nA+: packed place, 'old Havana' d\u00e9cor (including a vintage Cuban car in one corner), live\nmusic (intoxicating blend of African, Caribbean, European and other rhythms that you\n*can't not* move to; people dancing between tables, at the bar, bartenders also breaking\nout their trumpets, maracas, bongos, cowbells). Chica, welcome to Miami!\nLovely lunch with my very dear aunt Marlene and cousin Julie, who were kind enough to\ndrive 1.5 hours from Boca, where they live, to have lunch with me and Kay. Yummy fresh\n                    \nsalmon burger, iced tea at River Oyster Bar. Delightful to see them and spend time\ntogether.\nMany in Miami speak only Spanish; this surprised me. You really don't need English at all\nto get by. Although this proved a bit frustrating once or twice (e.g. arranging to have a\nwheelchair pick me up in the Miami airport), I found it pleasantly d\u00e9paysant. Heavily\nLatinx and generally international city: encountered folks from Puerto Rico, Haiti, France,\nCuba, Peru etc.\n'Old money' (i.e. 40-something man in attire of a New England preppy>the Palm Beach\ncrowd?) v. 'new' (lots of bling, heavy gold watches, women in sparkly skin tight clothing,\nthigh-high boots). Admittedly, my sample is small.\nAnd then there was Kay. We met in about 1971 in Amherst, MA (she lived there, I was\nsummering there while my father taught at UMass), through a local production of \"The\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer\" (Kay, a dancer, choreographed; I played Aunt Polly). We\nbecame fast friends and visited one another in NY and Amherst throughout middle and\nhigh school; my trips to Amherst would always involve a walk down to the back door of\nthe Grist Mill restaurant to buy the crispest French fries straight out of the fryer in the\nkitchen. We wound up classmates - even dormmates - at Harvard, but with different\nfriend groups. We drifted a bit after that -- always keeping in touch through annual\nbirthday phone calls and occasional get-togethers, but our connection became slightly\nperfunctory. My illness brought us back together, even back to the closeness of our\nearliest friendship, with Kay visiting me in State College last year and now agreeing\nenthusiastically, and kindly, to take this trip with me (and a bit for me too, I suspect).\nEveryone should have a Kay in their life.\nWho else would:\n>Gift me, on arrival, with a pair of white sunglasses, the better to look glam (or some\nversion of it!) by the pool?\n>Gift me, soon after, with a Mandarin Oriental cap and fan pin (the fan being the logo of\nMO), so we'd be decked out in full regalia as \"Friends of MO?\" This was all documented in\nphotos, of course. The cap had a decal on it that said \"50+,\" which we soon realized\nwould become the theme of our visit: the anniversary of our 50+ years of friendship. This\ntheme was in part inspired by the emails I received from MO addressed to \"Mr. Young\"\nand those Kay received addressed to \"Ms. Silverman,\" and wishing us a happy\nanniversary!\n>Purchase an enormous, oversized stuffed rabbit in the hotel gift shop just because \"she\nhad to have it?\" She dubbed the rabbit...MO (Moe?) and we quickly anthropomorphized\n                    \nhim (her? them?), envisioning him screaming for dear life when stuffed into Kay's\nsuitcase for her flight from Miami to San Antonio, to visit her soon to be married son?\n>Be dramatic, witty, uproariously funny, real, considerate, supportive, trustworthy, and\neasygoing? Now I understand why we look giddy and gleeful in the photo taken of us\nperhaps fifty years ago! Now I understand why we always stayed up half the night during\nour sleepovers, digging deep into the existential questions! Study the present to\nunderstand the past.\n>Carry a clutch covered in green grass and wear funky platform sandals topped by a\nhuge tuft of brown fluff -- and adopt MO the rabbit --  because she insists she loves\nthings that \"she can pat?\"\n>Ensure I felt comfortable and enjoyed myself?\n\"Parce que c'\u00e9tait [elle], parce que c'\u00e9tait moi.\"\nThe trip felt the antithesis of death-centric; au contraire, it was rejuvenating and life-\naffirming. I actually felt...healthy? Kay suggested that I might do more of this type of\ntravel as it felt so vivifying. The travel, the prospect of which I had been nervous about,\nwas not unmanageable. Sedona, anyone?The trick: a wheelchair in the airport.\nYes, totally and completely self-indulgent I know. Don't hate me.\n**********************************************************************************\nBack to Department of ssdd: Have put off my new line of chemo for a few more days\nsince, on my return home, I discovered that my copay would be $700 for each\ntreatment, once every three weeks. Lily Oncology Support Center denied my application\nfor their Savings Card Program. I will take a few days to see whether I am eligible for any\nother type of support. Of course, if Alimta does indeed turn out to be the silver bullet it\nwill be worth it, but...yikes. Meanwhile, I go without treatment.  Also, I continue to haggle\nwith Aetna about the $25K they billed me for my last two chemo treatments of 2022,\nbills that I am appealing. I think big pharma + the insurance companies are conspiring to\nkill me.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Health update: Since returning from my fab trip to Miami recently, I started a new, and\nostensibly final, course of chemo last Friday: Alimta (new drug for me) + Avastin. One\ntreatment every three weeks; a three-day course of steroids + folic acid to help\n                    \nabsorption. A three-hour magnesium infusion this past week as my level was quite low.\nNo notable side effects yet except fatigue. \nMarch 13th will bring another brain MRI, as it's been three months since my last one.\nThankfully, as if my brain 'knew' I would need my energy to contend with\nabdominal/stomach discomfort and fatigue, it has been 'behaving' the past few months.\nThat is, no crippling headaches thank goodness, although I may feel a bit of swelling in\nthe area of my cerebellum when I'm lying on my right side or on my back at night.\nWhat happens after this course of chemo? How will this all play out? I don't know.\nAnother treatment option? Free fall? A miraculous feat of further survival? I'd love to\nmake it to the five-year mark in April 2024.\nI am hanging in. I am feeling so-so. Some things are becoming harder for me. Lifting\nanything even remotely heavy causes a tugging or tearing sensation in my lower\nabdomen, where tumors are situated (I remember how difficult it became for me to carry\nmy briefcase to my car right before I was first diagnosed). My digestion is still a bit\nwonky and I have to be careful (but drinking healthy smoothies in the morning with all\nsorts of fresh fruit, yogurt, a\u00e7ai juice, flax seed etc. helps). I feel tired a lot but still\nhaven't tested the Ritalin I was prescribed.\nI find myself in a rather strange 'headspace' now. I sometimes feel alienated in normal\nsocial situations. Or perhaps rather, I sometimes feel I'm living in a bubble, on another\nplane. I inhabit a resolutely existential space, dealing often 24/7 (yes, in my dreams too!)\nwith the most profound existential questions about mortality, legacy, suffering, love and\ntransition -- whether I'm walking through the peaceful garden at the Centre County\nMemorial Park, recognizing the markers of fellow congregants who will one day be my\nneighbors or sitting in a room surrounded by urns and caskets, discussing Jewish burial\ncustoms with the director at the Koch Funeral Home (needless to say, my cultural\nhistorian's curiosity was piqued by this convo).\nI'm downsizing, simplifying, streamlining. The two wonderful young women who help me\nout for an hour or two each day are organizing all my closets, opening up space. My\nhouse feels airy, light, stripped of things that (pace Marie Kondo) do not 'bring me joy.'\nThis helps me so much psychologically. I'm also paring down my circle of acquaintances.\nI hesitate to mention this as I think it sounds 'mean' but I'm involved in a process of\nclarifying. In the end, it's not hard.\nI am so grateful to the friends who have truly made the effort to understand my reality,\nto 'hold space' for me through this journey and be with me physically when they can. I\nhope you know who you are. Thank you for not fearing being afraid, sad, repelled, upset,\nconfused, disoriented. You certainly make me feel less alone. Without seeming arrogant,\nI hope you feel in some way that it's a privilege to be part of this journey, and that it\n                    \nmight make it easier when you need to confront something similar down the line. You'll\nhave wise(r) perspective. So I hope I've been able to provide some type of service (dare I\nsay gift?) for you in that way. We've been lucky that way, I guess. In the end, these\nrelationships distill into love, authenticity, gratitude. And that's a magical thing.\nI appreciate a good number of other well-wishers. Some I know less well than others, or\nfor less time than my oldest friends, so I understand the challenges (for you) of\ntranslating emotions into words and actions.\nDespite what I've written above, I remain very much 'in the world,' or perhaps 'between\ntwo kingdoms,' as Susan Sontag observes in \"Illness as Metaphor.\" A few gratitude-\ninducing items, currently:\n>Ben is here! For almost two weeks. He's working remotely and has installed his gentle,\nhelpful, calm, kind, caring, droll self in our home, in his bedroom upstairs. His presence\nmakes me feel so much better. Although it's become more difficult, I just *had* to do\nsome cooking for his arrival: homemade stuffed shells w/homemade sauce etc. and\nIndian rice pudding (both came out very well but it's a heavy combo, perhaps my\ninadvertent nod to Mardi Gras). This week I'll also make an Ottolenghi salad with braised\nfennel.\n>The small army of helpers who now pop in every day, *eradicating* the series of\ndreams I was having about gigantic messes that I need to clean up while feeling\npowerless and overwhelmed.\n>My oncology nurses -- Brianne, Tracey, Rachel, Beth, Jess -- who have become friends; \n>The days are getting longer! I def. want to make it to fresh asparagus season, so I can\ndrive out among the Amish farms and buy armfuls of them for tasty asparagus soup.\n>We're in the Pisces zone! I'm picking up on the energy of my moon sign (4 March), and\nMichael's (24 February), and my nephew Isaac's (26 February), all born within less than a\ntwo-week span (in different years, naturally). Something about '4' also feels significant:\nMichael's bday is the 24th of this month, I'm the 4th of March, and Ben is April 4th (my\ngood friend Monique's bday is February 4th). I remember packing my bag for the hospital\non my birthday in 1995, thinking Ben might arrive two weeks before his due date. Turns\nout he was two weeks late, had to be induced, and didn't arrive for a full month, while\nmy hospital bag sat in the corner. On the night he was born, we were shocked to see out\nthe window, perhaps a quarter of a mile from the hospital, a large, fiery burning disk. A\nburning bush? An omen surrounding Ben's birth? Come to find out (as they say in these\nparts) that the conflagration likely resulted from an act of arson committed by one of the\nsons of Jerry Sandusky, convicted child molester and former PSU football coach. Strange\nconvergences...\n                    \nHow two Pisceans (Michael and I) ever raised an Aries son like Ben (confident leader,\ndetermined, sometimes stubborn) is a mystery to me. However, Michael is *not at all* a\ntypical Pisces, unlike me (dreamy, creative, artsy, intuitive, mystical, spiritual etc.) and\nmust have his sun in a sign like Aries or Capricorn. I recently found out myself that my\nsun is in Capricorn too, tempering my penchant for 'flowery thoughts' (as a social\nscientist colleague once joked about me) with a highly tenacious, ambitious core. More\nastrological musings another time.... :)",

    "entry": "Health update: I haven't felt bad since my last chemo infusion on 17 February. That is,\nnothing acute (e.g. intestinal blockage, severe headache, clot etc.) has made its\npresence known (but could any time, of course). Reason enough to be thankful. Tumors\nin my lower abdomen make standing (or sitting, for that matter) for more than an hour\nor two difficult - and painful. Fatigue fluctuates: some days I have to lie right back down\non the couch after breakfast, others I can make it through the day without a rest, take\ncare of business/work at my desk, run errands, visit with friends. Tomorrow I will meet\nwith Dr. Patel; I want to know how he sees the next few months unfolding, when he\nthinks I should next have a CT-scan to see how my cancer is faring on the new line of\nchemo etc. This Friday I have chemo + a two-hour magnesium infusion. Next Monday I'll\nsee my palliative care doctor and then undergo a routine brain MRI, which I'll then\ndiscuss with Dr. Patel 'jeune,' my radiation oncologist, next Thursday. I am most anxious\nabout the MRI. Are there new metastases in my brain? Is the slight discomfort I feel at\nnight when my head presses into the pillow at certain angles 'something' - or nothing?\nAnd if it's 'something,' what's the plan? Of course lying completely immobile for 45\nminutes in a tube, agitated by the sound of violent jackhammering, is disconcerting and\nstressful (time to practice the meditation techniques I picked up at the spa in Miami!).\nThe current treatment goal, to reiterate, is to contain my cancer and its spread. In the\nbest case scenario, perhaps we'll see some shrinkage of tumors and cancerous areas.\nAny thought of 'cure' is off the table. In fact, I haven't received any good news on that\nfront (remission etc.) in about three years! Still, I soldier on. Living one day at a time,\nwhile quite difficult, has proven the most effective strategy for staying in the now.\nI attribute my feeling no worse the past two weeks, and in fact mostly relatively ok, to\nBen's presence and to seeing and hearing from so many friends around my birthday.\nPlus, the fabulous vibe of the Miami trip has lingered.\nI was glad to lift a glass to my son at my birthday party and declare, \"Ben makes\neverything better.\" I loved stumbling out of my bedroom every morning for the two\nweeks he was here and having him come downstairs from his bedroom/workspace to\nexchange a quick hug and greeting. He helped me out around the house, cleaned up\nafter the party, cooked me dinner (shakshuka), ran errands for me, brought me tea,\npitched in to advance my downsizing efforts -- all quite willingly! What we especially\nenjoy doing together: a) cooking; b) watching the Knicks; c)collaborating on the NYTimes\nSpelling Bee; d) hanging out. Ben also treated me to a cocktail at Pine Grove Hall, a local\nplace that is ambitious about its food (sometimes more successfully than others) and\nlibations. The place has two fantastic bartenders who mix serious drinks: they scoff at\nanything overly sweet but do wonders with hard liquor+++. Sc'Eric concocted a drink for\nme (on the spot) that featured applejack, cr\u00e8me de cacao, a few other ingredients,\nwithin a salted rim. Very yummy.\n                    \nBen's doing well, and will soon be off to Vienna to ski with Sammi somewhere in Austria.\nIn early April, the two of them will return to NY together, as Sammi's year working at the\nIAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) will have come to a close. I'll be relieved\nwhen both of them are back in the States.\nThe best things about birthdays, in no particular order: BUTTERCREAM. All the Facebook\nmessages, texts, cards, phone calls, DMs, bouquets, and emails, and the happy\nadrenaline 'ping' each one brings. Being remembered. Spending time with loved ones.\nGetting dressed up. This year, four gorgeous floral arrangements from Daniel Vaughn\n(wonderful local florist) sent by special people. Parties!\nWhen I was little, my mother arranged lovely birthday parties for me (with my younger\nbrother Ethan in attendance). We played games (pin the tail on the donkey, musical\nchairs). I always had a cake from the Gramercy Park Pastry Shop, adorned with figurines\n(usually ballerinas, maybe circus figures; boys' cakes, in those gendered to the max and\ngenerally unwoke days, featured a baseball team or cowboys and Indians....) and\ncovered in BUTTERCREAM. In the late 60s (?) I had a paper dress party; often on a 'flower\npower' theme, those mini-dresses were all the rage. Another year, when I was perhaps\n11 to 13, my friends Eva and Zia gave me makeup! I was enthralled. Mary Quant (her\nvibe was London's Carnaby Street, flower power, Twiggy, swinging 60s, cosmetics in\nbold, daring purple and red) and Yardley. I remember a sticky orangey lip gloss in a\nwhite plastic container. I felt so grown up! I've spent many birthdays in France, at least\ntwo with student groups I was leading. One year (sans students) brought brilliant\nsunshine but also wind and a bit of a chill; I took the day off and spent it gallivanting all\nover Paris by myself, treating myself to lunch, chocolates, tea and a lemon tart - and\nother indulgences. \nMy party guests this year were eager to gab, meet people they didn't know, dance (a\nconga line!), and direct their healthy appetites to a 'well-curated' (thanks, Deb, for that\ndescription) selection of charcuterie, olives, p\u00e2t\u00e9/cornichons, goug\u00e8res, fruit salad, Italian\ncookies from Veneiro's bakery in New York, and a spectacular cake -- chocolate layers\nwith mocha BUTTERCREAM, covered with BUTTERCREAM flowers and, as a nod to one of\nmy signature emblems, gold foil gingko leaves. And a teal cancer ribbon in fondant.\nVeuve Clicquot, wine, and Negronis (which I love) mixed by a friend who has a way with\ncocktails.\nI am one lucky girl.\nLet me die in a vat of BUTTERCREAM.\nSomeone conjectured that this birthday might be 'poignant' for me. Of course, I had the\npassing thought: \"What if this is my last?\" Well, then I will have gone out like the\nMontmartre revelers I wrote about a while back, carpe diem-ing, kicking their heels up in\n                    \nthe clouds. Or I could be that proverbial \"they gave her a year but she lived for five\"\nperson that we've all met or heard about.  Who knows? Again, living in the now means\nnot dwelling on the future when it's unnecessary. On my birth day, I felt energized by the\npresence of friends and had a great time; I hunger for more days like this. But for now,\neat, drink, and be merry..... And eat the BUTTERCREAM first!\n \nPhotos",

    "entry": "Back to the mood swings after the uplift of Ben's visit and much birthday cheer. But\nthat's just how we roll these days.\nHad my regular check-up/check-in with Dr. Patel this past Monday. For the first time\never, he asked whether I 'had my affairs in order.' I understand that this is a reasonable,\npro forma question to ask someone whose cancer is both advanced and metastatic, but\nstill, for some reason, it threw me. While Dr. Beavis has been the self-described\n'quarterback,' with a clear sense of the layout of the entire field, Dr. Patel has always\nbeen my 'kick the can' guy. For Beavis, the best case scenario in terms of survival would\nbring me to Baltimore, alive and kicking, for an annual checkup this December; for Patel,\nit's always been: \"Here's the problem, here's how we're going to treat it.\" I had never\nbefore heard him mentioning anything pertaining to an 'end game,' projected lifespan\n(he won't go there), etc. Before now. Of course, he was simply doing 'due diligence' as\nan oncologist, and also acknowledging that some folks simply can't face this task of\n'tying up,' but need to for all the reasons. Still, not easy to hear.\nHe also told me not to be disappointed by the results of the next CT scan, to occur in\nroughly 3-6 weeks, I believe. I've had so many lines of chemo that the cancer cells have\nbecome very adept at mutating in order to not be targeted by the successive lines of\ntreatment.\nFinally, I *think* I understood him to say, in response to a question I had, that at this\npoint an acute incident might become more likely as my disease is now more advanced.\nI need to verify this: occasionally I miss a word or two of his due to his heavy Indian\naccent and rapid-fire talk, but it's really just as likely (if not more so) that I was filtering\nthe info I was receiving. So now of course I'm nervous about being struck unexpectedly\nby an acute event: intestinal blockage; double vision; migraine headaches, stroke. My\nthoughts careen and I need to reel them in, stay in the moment (a mantra: \"This is the\nday I've been given. How do I wish to best use it?\").\nThe mystery: I look good, as I'm often told, and manage to accomplish a decent amount.\nI'm worried that things may become significantly harder, though.\nHad chemo on Friday - second infusion of Avastin + Alimta plus two-hour magnesium\ninfusion. Quite tolerable. However, I did not sleep *one wink* the preceding night; I'm not\nsure why my sleeplessness was so very extreme. It wasn't all unpleasant: I revisited my\nmiddle school/high school years, with a vivid, extended focus on some of my wonderful\nteachers. Mainly women, they were totally invested in our education (I remembered this\nas I was going through and finally discarding many of my old school notebooks). They\nwere smart, serious, and many of them happened to wear dark rectangular glasses that\nmade them look particularly intellectual. They also formed, I realized, a fascinating\n                    \n\u00e9migr\u00e9 community within our school: our dance teacher, Anita Zahn, a former student of\nIsadora Duncan's sister, hailed from Germany; she lived in an apartment she rented out\nin the hotel my grandmother owned, the Wales, across Madison Avenue on 92nd street;\nMadame Tatiana Bouteneff, a tall, slightly haughty yet jovial French teacher, was born in\nFrance to an aristocratic White Russian family, the Troubetzkoys; our wonderful, free-\nspirited art teacher, Miss Basilevsky ('Miss Basi') was also (White) Russian; our stern,\nrigorous Latin teacher, Miss von Heereman, had been, I believe, a member of the Dutch\nResistance during WWII (perhaps one of my NBS classmates can flesh this out a bit); our\nHistory teacher, Mrs. Gordon, was French, the daughter of Edouard Morot-Sir, French\ncultural counselor in New York. And another beloved, fiercely smart French teacher,\nMadame Schless, about whom I now read in a NYTimes obituary:  \"Edmee de M. Schless\nof New Canaan, CT, and Lectoure, France, died peacefully of natural causes. Born\nDecember 28, 1921, in Paris, as the third of nine children of the Count and Countess\nBoula de Mareuil, she led a privileged life until the onset of World War II. Her older\nbrother, Camille, was an organizer of the Normandy resistance who was captured early\nin the War. His notoriety forced the rest of the family to disperse and added to the\nstruggle and hardship that Edm\u00e9e experienced during the War as she raised her two\nyoungest siblings.\" Madame Schless' brother's story is fascinating and tragic (if you wish\nto know more, and read French: https://www.wikimanche.fr/Camille_Boula_de_Mareuil). I\nwish I had known more about these intrepid expat women at the time.  Someone must\nreally write about them. Anyway, it was a night of mental meanderings, which left me\npretty tired for chemo, but I'm back on track with sleep now.\nI also met with my lawyer and talked through some modifications I am making to my will.\nThis too left me stressed as I thought about the many details I still need to attend to. I\nwas able to go through just a few of these with Michael as he was driving me to chemo\nyesterday and need to catch with Ben too. Death and taxes: dealing with both of these at\nonce right now. Yes, both are inevitable!\nBrain MRI scheduled for tomorrow. I'm nervous. Thankfully, the past three months I've\navoided the telltale headaches that have tipped me off to likely brain mets in the past.\nBut I intuit there may still be 'stuff' going on, and how (or whether) we decide to treat it\nis unclear. I'll discuss the results Friday with Dr. Patel the younger. If the results look\ngood, I am hungering (literally) for a trip to Paris, which Dr. Patel the elder seems to\nsupport, as soon as possible after I know the scan results (I know this wouldn't\nnecessarily please Dr. Beavis...). I badly want to see my friends there, sit in favorite\nspots and *feel* why they make me happy, shop on the rue des Francs-Bourgeois and at\nAnne Elisabeth and La Petite Tonkinoise, and taste test tartes au citron all around town. I\nwant to immerse myself in the smells, sounds, and tastes of the march\u00e9 d'Aligre. If I\nhave the energy, I'd love to view the new Sarah Bernhardt exhibit at the Petit Palais.\nWanna join me? Of course, this trip is a huge IF at this point, but it's fun to think about,\nand who knows?... And maybe a few days in the city soon too, but again it all hangs in\nthe balance until Friday at least.\n                    \nI feel I must double down on asserting my dislike for martial metaphors  in discussion of\nserious/terminal illness (I was likely thinking about this at about 4 a.m. during my\nsleepless night). Americans love winners (a generalization, I know). Ergo, 'winning the\nbattle,' or even fighting it valiantly etc., is praiseworthy. By implication, is the person\nwho 'loses the battle' a loser? Further, how do I construe my decision to kill off many of\nmy healthy cells (which might be construed as 'losing') in order to destroy even more\ncancer cells? A Pyrrhic victory at best. My mind, emotions, and spirit, of course, are\ndoing everything imaginable to will my survival, but my body may simply not be able to\nfollow suit.\nHaving cancer is an experience.\nBeing a mother is an experience.\nGoing to graduate school was an experience.\nBeing a teen in New York in the 1970s was an experience.\nBeing a married woman was an experience.\nAttending high school, attending college were experiences.\nLiving abroad was an experience; my travels, collectively, constitute an experience.\nLike all the experiences mentioned above, my cancer journey is a longer-term\nexperience (to be distinguished from the many other types of experiences we can have).\nLike the aforementioned experiences, having cancer features its own cast of characters,\nevokes widely ranging emotions, conjures memorable moments and bleak ones, teaches\nme. While the winner/loser trope does not resonate with me in the slightest (I think I'm\nsimply doing what most of us would do if we want to live, to thrive), the 'experience' idea\nmeshes nicely with my current beliefs. So let's just skip the whole 'fighting the battle,'\n'winning/losing the war' etc. thing, ok?\nMemorable moments this week: catching up with my high school friend Jane on Zoom; I\nhave an open invitation to visit her in Hawaii and it is tempting! A wonderful dinner with\nfriends last night -- delicious food and drink, lively conversation, warmth and\ncamaraderie.  Tea and cake at my house today with my friend Jackie, a wise woman and\ncompassionate friend (the cake I made was Namoura, a Middle Eastern semolina cake\naerated with yogurt and baking soda, soaked in a sugar, lemon and rosewater syrup, and\nsprinkled with almonds and crushed pistachios).The two young women who come over\nevery day for an hour or two to help keep things running smoothly for me are\n*godsends.*\n                    \nRecent reads/viewings: Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ (why on earth had I not read this\nmasterpiece sooner?). Then saw the movie version with Oprah and Danny Glover (not\nbad but nearly impossible to capture the narrative inventiveness and language of the\nnovel).  Joan Didion's _Blue Nights,_ a sort of pendant to _The Year of Magical Thinking_\n(both very moving). _The Banshees of Inisherin_ (good acting and evocative\ncinematography; also, great sweaters. Oscar worthy, though?)",

And I firmly believe you\u2019re dealing with all of it better than most of us could. I loved\nthe account of your NBS teachers. What a great lineup! Much love to you!\n  \u2014Jane Mallison, March 12, 2023  \nThank you, Jane. Much love to you too!\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 12, 2023  \nAlways sending love to you\nXoxo\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, March 12, 2023  \nThank you, dear Heather.\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 12, 2023  \nMore fascinating and moving words! Fingers crossed for your next appointment. Xxx\n  \u2014Russ Gershon, March 12, 2023  \nThanks, Russ! xoxo\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 12, 2023  \nSending love and the one thing I remember about Miss Von Heereman\u2026 that she at one\npoint (when we were in high school) drew the job of signing us in in the mornings.\nSomewhere in my files, I still have a little scrap of paper featuring her noticeably\n                    \nTeutonic handwriting\u2014 first the date and time, then the message: Lisa Grunwald and Eva\nSaleh wore CLOGS!\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, March 12, 2023  \nLisa, this is too funny! Yes, somewhere I have a letter from her. Her handwriting\nwas indeed \"noticeably Tuetonic!\" Were we not allowed to wear clogs? I suppose not. I\ndo remember the humiliation of having to sink to our knees before Miss Goode and Miss\nHamilton at check in so they could verify whether our skirts were too short. They actually\nsent the offending girls *home!*\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 12, 2023  \nClogs! Jamais! And by the time my daughter, Ziz, attended (and was lucky enough\nto get as good an education as we did), there had been so clear loosening of the rules,\nbut the standard for skirt length had become a CD case from knee to hem.\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, March 13, 2023  \nI just love the way you include cancer as an \u2018experience\u2019, Willa, and eschew all of the\nmilitary language. I\u2019ve always found \u2018fight\u2019 to be wrong-headed. As you say, it makes\none immediately feel pride or shame as winner or loser. There\u2019s no need for it!\nAlso, I wonder if part of what was so distressing with Dr. Patel\u2019s \u2018affairs in order\u2019 question\nis that it makes you wonder, \u2018Does he know something about where I am in the timeline,\ndefinitively, that I don\u2019t?\u2019 The point is that you are blessed to be feeling well and you are\nable to be active and work around your illness. That means, ipso facto, that now isn\u2019t the\ntime to ask that question. I get it if he wants to indicate that the treatment options are\nfewer and less likely to work. Enough said.\nOh, I do hope you get to go to Paris! I love Paris in the springtime\u2026.and April in Paris. For\nyou, it is a second home and not just a lovely European city.\nYou are an inspiration because you are sharing the whole experience with those that\ncare about you, on Caring Bridge: the good, the challenging, the hopeful, the frightening.\nI hate tax season. I wouldn\u2019t want to be working on a will etc at the same time of year.\nBut so be it: we don\u2019t get to choose.\nSending a big hug. And a two cheek French peck! \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, March 12, 2023  \n                    \nI'm hoping for good results from tomorrow's brain MRI, and that you are able to go to\nParis, for which you are hungering! To see your friends and to enjoy again everything\nthat made you happy, and still does! Thank you for sharing the remembrances of some\nof your wonderful teachers! XOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, March 12, 2023  \nIf you get to Paris in the latter part of May, let us know. We would love to see you and go\nto a favorite place together.\n  \u2014Richard Shryock, March 13, 2023  \nThank you for the wonderful reminders of the inspirational teachers we had at\nNightingale. I feel blessed to have been given the opportunity to have had such a great\neducation. I also am blessed with wonderful friends like you.\n  \u2014Sarah Robinson, March 13, 2023  \nWe really did have a wonderful education, didn't we Sarah? I also feel so grateful\nfor that opportunity. And like you, I feel blessed to have terrific friends like you. So very\nglad we've reconnected. xoxo\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 13, 2023  \nWilla, you amaze me.\n  \u2014David Rothman, March 14, 2023  \nThank you, dear David! xo\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, March 15, 2023  \nMoi aussi, j'esp\u00e8re que cette escapade parisienne vous sera autoris\u00e9e et que nous\npourrons nous voir.

    "entry": "\"I woke last night to the sound of thunder/\nHow far off, I sat and wondered.\"\nThis lyric from my high school years pairs well with my dream or reverie of a few\ndays/nights ago: I could hear/feel thunder rumble, but didn't know how far it was from\nme. It felt ominous.\nSooo.... it was a bit of a medical-centric week. Monday I met with my palliative care\ndoctor, Dr. Vithalani. We talked a bit about my getting a medical alert system for home.\nThere wasn't too much of substance to talk about at this point, although I like and\nappreciate her (although, to be honest, I think she needs to become more\nknowledgeable about the types of cancers her patients are contending with). From there\nI drove to the hospital for my brain MRI (with a pit stop en route to enjoy an Otto's root\nbeer float with mocha chip!). The actual procedure, which I've now undergone many\ntimes, went quite smoothly. I was tired, so I just relaxed to the point of dozing, zoning\nout the clanging and loud humming assaulting my head.\nTuesday, my mother underwent what was supposed to be an outpatient procedure to\nregularize her heartbeat. From my brother's texts throughout the day, it sounded like a\nstressful experience: my mother had to wait several hours for the procedure and felt\nquite shaky afterwards, which resulted in her spending the night in the hospital. Of\ncourse, I was concerned about this, but now my mom is home and feeling a bit better\neach day. Her doctor will tweak her heart medications to bring her blood pressure, heart\nrate etc. under control. Ethan's well-earned reputation as a mensch extraordinaire (a\ngreat example to his nephew Ben, I must say, and undoubtedly to Ethan's own kids too)\ndid not falter throughout my mother's several days of travails (which could have been\nworse, of course): when I called my mother after she returned home, Ethan was in the\nkitchen cooking his yummy chicken soup!\nThursday I was at the hair salon. My hair continues to grow back and looks fairly decent\n(although it's so short that when I wake up it tends to stick straight up, making me look\nlike Bello the Clown). Pic attached.\nAs I hadn't received the radiologist's report on my MRI by Thursday, I called and\nrequested that it be posted to my Mount Nittany Medical Center Portal. I didn't read it\nuntil Friday, though, before my appointment with the radiation oncologist. Not quite\nknowing what to expect (I knew, for example, that I hadn't had any severe headaches,\ndouble vision, or loss of sensation in extremities for at least three months), I was\nheartened by the sentence \"No new areas of enhancement identified to suggest\nprogressive metastatic disease\" and by the radiologist's \"impression: Overall, stable to\ndecrease in size.\" The less good news is that, in going over the images with a fine tooth\n                    \ncomb, Dr. Patel the younger identified four tiny (1-2 mm) spots that were there before\nbut that have increased very slightly in size. He said we could wait three months to treat\nthem (after another MRI) -- essentially kicking the can -- or we could radiate them. It all\ndepends on my goals: do I want to treat every bit of cancer we safely can if it might\nprolong my life and ensure the quality of it or do I simply not want to be bothered with\ncommitting to five more rounds of radiation, having that awful mask made again, etc.\nAnd I do wonder about $ too with the changes to our PSU insurance policy. I will likely go\nfor more radiation, which he said there is no rush to perform (I could wait up to six\nweeks, potentially). The two Drs. Patel spoke; the elder told the younger (as the younger\nreported to me) that I \"look good\" and could definitely manage more radiation at this\npoint. In any event, Dr. Patel (who I've come to like; he's kind, but a straight shooter)\ndoes not consider this a 'bad' report, rather one that shows \"subtle progression,\" in his\nwords. There are no new spots. The spots we radiated last time are gone. It could be\nworse.\nFrom there, I went straight to the ER (merely to the front entrance of the hospital as the\ncancer center is located at its rear), a visit that was somewhat more vexing. I was hoping\nthey would scan my side/abdomen/stomach etc. to see if they could assess what was\ncausing my discomfort in those areas, and that's exactly what they did. There were long\nwaits for everything, of course, but overall I found the care perfectly competent, which\nhas not always been my experience at Mt. Nittany (including when Ben was born there). I\nwas fairly certain that the nice young doctor, Dr. Burton, was the same one who had first\ndetected my cancer on a dreary Easter Sunday in 2019, when I had come to the ER\nbecause of severe constipation (due to lesions on my colon, I found out). I remember Dr.\nBurton seeming shaken when he had reviewed that first CT-scan in 2019, because so\nmuch cancer was present (I had shut down from shock). In any event, this time Dr.\nBurton went through his records and confirmed that he was indeed the very same\ndoctor! I told him that I had had a good four years since he had seen me, and he was\nvery warm. I also could have sworn that the technician guiding me through the CT-scan\non Friday was the same one as in 2019, the one who had asked me, somewhat\nominously, I felt, \"how long have you had this problem?\" and who had wished me \"good\nluck\" - sinisterly, it seemed to me, as I was being wheeled out of the scan room. This\ntime, I simply asked him how long he had been at the hospital and he responded twelve\nyears. Definitely a PTSD moment. And as my friend Andrew noted wisely, commenting on\na previous post, my assumption that this technician had 'secret knowledge' that gave\nhim some sort of power over me felt very scary. So much for that trip down memory\nlane, lol.\nEnfin -- the CT scan did not reveal an infection, nor a kidney stone (due to some blood in\nmy urine and discomfort/pain on my flank), nor anything of that nature. However, it did\nshow progression of my cancer, revealing a new spot on my liver and a spot on my lung.\nThe doctor felt this could be causing my discomfort, given where it is localized (although\nDr. Vithalani or someone told me that I was unlikely to feel pain from cancer on my\n                    \nliver). Obviously, this is not great news, although not unexpected. The metastases,\nthough, make me quite nervous.\nI was so exhausted from my day at the hospital, and the stress induced, that I went to\nbed at 10 p.m. Friday and slept until 4 p.m. the next day! I had been given morphine at\nthe hospital, which lifted my pain and relaxed me, but on coming off it I was really wiped.\nAt 4 p.m. I heard someone knock on my door and then enter my house. It was Michael;\nBen had been worried that he hadn't been able to get in touch with me and was worried\n(Michael was pretty sure I was sleeping; his intuitions on these things are usually quite\nsensible). Unfortunately, my iPhone settings had also changed during the night,\npreventing my seeing notifications of phone messages in the usual manner. I texted and\ncalled Ben immediately as well as others who had been nice enough to check in. \nVoil\u00e0.\nCurrent mood: very pissed off thinking about all the things I wanted to do (a list maybe\nfor another time) and all my goals that I will likely not be able to accomplish.\nTo improve my mood, I think I'll go to NY this week, provided I feel up to it. I want to\ncheck on my mother and help her if I can, see family and friends as my energy permits\n(also frustrated that I definitely have the *will* but am somewhat limited in what I can\ndo; Uber is my friend). On the other hand, as in my experience get-togethers with friends\nhave tended to energize me (as does my city), it's possible that this will hold true next\nweek.\nRandom stuff:\nRe my last post: for my NBS pals: Miss von Heereman had not been a member of the\nDutch Resistance. She was born in Silesia, a German-speaking part of Poland, to an\naristocratic family and educated by private tutors, one a priest who taught her Latin. She\nleft Silesia via Switzerland because of the political situation, seemingly an allusion to the\nrise of Nazism (per an NBS publication). So yes, I regret I won't have time to write a\nbook, or at least an article, about these fascinating expat women who educated us!\nReading: _The Remains of the Day,_ Kazuo Ishiguro. Oh my, what a novel.\nI know that out of caring some of you wanted to get news of my MRI results as soon as\nthey became available. I appreciate your concern but please understand that I have to\ndo this on my own time. It's not that I want to withhold information but sometimes I have\na lot to process. I need to ensure that I have time to do this before sharing news with\nanyone outside my family.\nNot a whole lot of 'fun' this weekend, but I'm going to visit my friend Maria in her new\nhouse later.\n                    \nPhotos",

    "entry": "It's been a minute. Apologies.\nA rough day Friday the 17th, as recounted in my last post -- identification of four tiny\ncancerous spots in my brain, to be radiated soon, followed immediately by an ER visit\nthat revealed via CT-scan progression of my cancer, w/additional liver and lung mets --\nsent me (after I *crashed* for eighteen hours of sleep) into a panicked, desperate mode;\nI felt I needed to go into overdrive to get 'everything' done within an ever-shrinking time\nframe. When I calmed down, I simply decided that I needed to get away ('flight'\nresponse?), needed a change of scene, of ideas. And I wanted to see my mother, who\nrecently underwent a heart procedure. So last Tuesday I got on the train to New York.\nTime with old friends + family + favorite taste treats + the city both energizes and\nrelaxes me. It's a non-chemical mood enhancer and remedy. I needed it, and frankly,\nsometimes I need to be in denial, to not think about my health challenges. At the same\ntime, while I did push myself a bit, I also made necessary adjustments (Ubers and buses\ninstead of the subway; get-togethers mainly near my mother's apartment, where I was\nstaying). I arranged ahead of time to see four of my oldest and dearest friends, two from\ngrade school -- Jill, with whom I traveled to Paris last May, and Zia -- and two from grad\nschool -- Isabelle (we shared thin-crust pizza, giggles and bubbles at Posto on 18th st.)\nand Shanny (tea near Rock Center). One thing I love about these get-togethers is that\n*there is always so much to talk about* because these friendships have such strong\nfoundations and long histories. And it just feels so great to spend time together, enjoying\neach other's company: \"Parce que c'\u00e9tait [elle], parce que c'\u00e9tait moi\" (pace Montaigne).\nMy brother Ethan and I caught up over an Indian thali platter in 'Curry Hill,' then shopped\nat international foods mecca, Kalustyan (I bought their store-made hummus, labne with\nfig jam, and a small piece of halvah); it felt warming and familiar to hang out with my\nbrother and indulge in foodie activities in a corner of the city we grew up in. I also caught\nBen for dinner on the eve of his departure to Vienna to meet up with Sammi. They're in\nLisbon right now and will come home together on April 8th, at the conclusion of Sammi's\nyear in Vienna (I will be *so* happy when these two are back on US soil). After dinner\n(ramen/sushi, mediocre) we visited with my mother for a while. Mom, Arnold and I also\nhad dinner at my mother's one night; Arnold, at 97, is off on a trip to the World War II\nmuseum in New Orleans. He's amazing! Also loved taking in the smells and sights of\nearly spring both at the large Greenmarket in Union Square and along E. 17th st. near\nRutherford Place, where blooming magnolia trees looked lovely against a row of 19th\ncentury brownstones topped with miniature figures of jockeys! Did some minor shopping\n-- Sephora for shimmery eye shadow, Breads Bakery for babka (which I gifted a friend)\nand one of their superior egg salad sandwiches. \nMy mother's recent, usually outpatient, heart procedure to correct a-fib did not go\nentirely as smoothly as expected (she wound up in the hospital overnight). She's home\n                    \nand stable (has been going out in the neighborhood etc.) but still lacks energy in the\nmorning. I tried to help out as much as  I could -- cooked asparagus soup, ran errands,\naccompanied her to an urgent care clinic one morning (she feels better now) -- and was\nglad for the time I was able to spend with her. She'll have a telehealth appointment with\nher cardiologist on Friday.\nBack in PA, more uncertainty and anxiety. I was at the radiation oncologist's yesterday\nfor the CT-scan that Dr. Patel the younger will use to pinpoint the cancerous spots he will\nthen zap. I also had made, for the third time, that hideous Darth Vader mask that will be\nused to bolt me down to the table; nothing like having warm plastic molded around your\nface while you clamp down on a bit pushed into your mouth. But really, the brain\nradiation is the least of my worries right now!\nDrs. Beavis and Patel want to stop my current course of chemo (Avastin/Alimta) because\nit's not working (as the CT-scan from the ER clearly indicated). So, no chemo this week.\nDr. Beavis is willing to try - as a final option (?) - a new chemo drug just authorized by\nthe FDA last December, called Elahere. It's so new that Dr. Patel senior has never\nadministered it. It works a bit differently from my previous chemo drugs (I forget how;\nwill need to look at Dr. Beavis' email). Dr. Beavis tested it on my tumor (of which they've\nkept a sample at Hopkins!) and was glad to see that I have the 'correct' tumor type to be\nable to receive Elahere. Questions: can it be obtained and administered in State College?\nWill insurance cover it? How will I tolerate it? Dr. Patel's nurse emailed me yesterday and\nsuggested that perhaps I would start treatment w/Elahere at Hopkins because it may\ntake a while for my Geisinger facility to obtain it. I'll see Dr. Patel on Friday and will have\nmany questions for him.\nThen there is the question of side effects. From my (granted brief, initial) reading about\nElahere, I have learned that a potential side effect is severe ocular degeneration. Dr.\nPatel's nurse therefore informed me that my ophthalmologist would need to be on board\nand I'd have to visit him frequently to receive doses of steroid eye drops under his\nsupervision. Oh my. Between Scylla and Charybdis: do I stop all treatment now,\nhastening my demise, or try Elahere and risk impairing my vision, which provides me\nwith most of the agency I enjoy now (driving, walking, reading, writing, cooking etc.\netc.)? Need to find out more on Friday.\nA few nights ago, I found myself again spinning towards panic and desperation and said\nout loud, to no one in particular: \"I'm scared.\" The next day I got a grip.\nPhysically, I'm feeling so-so. I have discomfort on my side that may be attributable to the\ncancer in my liver. A heating pad helps. Clearly, my cancer is becoming more perilous\nthese days.\n                    \nIn a suggestive article in the NYTimes today, written by a palliative doctor, I read this: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/opinion/how-to-accept-death.html\n\"Reconsidering what we think acceptance means \u2014 and whether it will come to pass \u2014 requires loosening our\nexpectations of those who are dying. To become better at talking to one another honestly about death and to\ntruly prepare for it, we must first understand why we expect the dying to demonstrate readiness in the first\nplace.\"\nIn regard to what I wrote in another post about historical conceptions of \"a good death,\" this doctor posits that\nthere is really no 'right way' to die, and that notions of 'acceptance,' death bed confessions, last-minute patching-\nup of conflicts, etc., are -- like the martial metaphors applied to death that I've been railing against - ways for\nsome people to keep death at a distance, to fit it into a neat box and to deny its right to 'messiness,' to defying of\ncategorization.\nThis article resonated with me and in some way relieved me of the 'pressure' to have a 'good death' or even to\naccept death. I realize I've been mouthing a narrative of acceptance -- perhaps simply to keep myself from going\noff the deep end -- but not entirely buying into it. At the current moment, I'm finding it obscene and entirely\nunacceptable that a vibrant sixty-four-year old woman with so many goals for her future and who savors life so\nmuch should have to die. But then again, my moods and thoughts can change like quicksilver.\nI took a peaceful country drive the morning after I returned from the city, another non-chemical antidote, this\none to the densely-packed streets and quick pace of New York. The sight of clotheslines fluttering in the breeze\non Amish farms; cows, horses, and sheep peacefully grazing; a buggy or two rolling by; the earth readying to\nyield its first crops (maybe asparagus, spring onions, and rhubarb?) was a natural calmant.\nAnd was happy to join three friends for dinner last night at Allen Street Grill, and look forward to having\nbreakfast tomorrow with my friend (and college classmate, and former State College resident) Heather, after\nseveral years. And Passover is next week! A celebration of renewal and freedom!\nP.S. More NY pictures to follow\nP.P.S. Please know that I would really have liked to have seen other friends in the city, too. I am sorry that I did\nnot have more time and physical wherewithal to do so. \n.\n \n                    \nPhotos",

How lucky we have such a\nwonderful classmates how wonderful we have such good friendships.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, March 29, 2023  \nWilla-\nAs always you offer your readers such. \u201cpalette\u201d of things to think about - some\nterrifying, some joyous, some literally delicious. Thank you for such thoughtful writing on\nall your different topics. Happy you were able to be in NYC and had so many good\nadventures. Much love to you! \u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014Jane Mallison, March 29, 2023  \nDear Willa,\nWhen I start to type \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d about the recent test results, I stop myself because\n(although I fervently wish the results had been different) your posts are bursting with so\nmuch connection, joy, and celebration\u2014quintessential Willa qualities\u2014that it feels wrong\nto lead with the negative in my comments. I am so happy that you followed your\ninstincts, went to NY and had such a soul satisfying time with loved ones. Your thoughts\nabout releasing expectations resonate with me. When Anne was in hospice we had\nconversations about such things which I can share with you privately if you\u2019d like. One\nthing that stays with me is her desire to be herself to the end and to be remembered for\nthe vivacious person she was, not for her illness or passing. Sorry for this lengthy\ncomment but I wanted you to know how much my thoughts are with you and how there\nis absolutely no wrong or right way to face whatever comes. xoxox Melissa\n  \u2014Melissa Beattie Moss, March 29, 2023  \nI love that notion about how, as a consummate and trained over-achiever, one can even\npressure oneself to do dying the best way possible. I believe there is an inherent\nimpossibility: on the one hand one doesn\u2019t want to give up treatment options, no matter\nif they have uncertain probability of helping, yet one is also tasked with living one\u2019s life\nso that one is \u2018ready\u2019 and prepared to die. That\u2019s too hard and mutually exclusive. If one\nneeds to face death and deal with it, that\u2019s a load that\u2019s sufficiently ambitious and\ndifficult to send one\u2019s way and author one\u2019s road/journey (excuse the mixed metaphors).\nBut if one feels time ticking and some pressure to be fully prepared and also, at the\nsame time, must deal with the huge difficulties of managing doctors and treatments and\nthe gauges of \u2018progress\u2019, that is also no small task. So we take someone who by the\nnature of dying is alone and frightened and physically di is he\u2019d and charge them with\nboth navigating treatment and being fully prepared to die\u2026and we provide little support\nand compassion around either task, and we end up flogging the prone to worry and\n                    \nexcess effort achiever with too full and too contradictory a set of tasks. We don\u2019t help\npeople realize when they are best served working towards a good enough death and\nrelieve them of a sense of what steps the must accomplish and transition to the notion of\nletting go and finding some inner acceptance and peace and stopping the harried and\ndesperate attempts to \u2018fight\u2019 and save one\u2019s own life\u2026.and, instead, ask how they might\nbring themselves some quiet, peace, relaxation, and relief in this chapter. No tasks to\naccomplish, no tough decisions, no work to do\u2026just the embrace of finding one\u2019s way\ninto one\u2019s sanctuary and maybe one\u2019s sense of G-d and the wider world of existence\nthrough time. How can one give oneself over into G-d\u2019s protective care? How can one\nuse their tradition and it\u2019s resources to pray and meditate and look for peace? And isn\u2019t\nthat task enough? And don\u2019t you deserve that? If you don\u2019t stop the harried to-ing and\nfro-ing and treatment roller coaster and turn to face G-d now, then when? In your last\nweek(s)? Why does that get squeezed into only a few days? It\u2019s big and important work\nand offers peace and solace. Nobody tells you it\u2019s time to turn. But it is. One man\u2019s\nhumble thoughts, my friend. You can say no more to running and chasing improvement\nand being repeatedly disappointed. You can decide to turn and face G-d, instead, and\nask for peace and affirmation and comfort and even salvation (tho that may be a fraught\nconcept in Judaism). It\u2019s time to relax and turn things over to G-d. My love and total\nconsideration and compassion are with you, friend. Go peacefully in the direction of relief\nand support and peace and resolution and free yourself of the \u2018must do\u2019 feelings. You\naren\u2019t waging war. You have no battle to fight nor jobs to do. Your job is to turn yourself\nto G-d. Again, one man\u2019s view. \ufffd\ufffd\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, March 29, 2023  \nThank you, dear friend.

    "entry": "Again, it's been a minute. Much going on. But that's how we roll.\nOn the 31st, I had an appointment with Dr. Patel. Dr. Beavis had sent him information\nabout Elahere and I could tell that his staff (Kayla, his lead nurse; the nurses in the\ninfusion room; Dr. Patel) were motivated to educate themselves about this new (for\nthem, as only recently FDA-approved) drug and to gear up for the first infusion. I had\nalready pretty much come around to moving ahead with Elahere (what's the\nalternative??), but remain nervous due to potential side effects, notably the ocular\ntoxicity (visual impairment, corneal damage, pain behind the eyes) that occurs in 60% of\nthe cases, according to one study I read (this damage reverses itself in about half the\ncases, but if it doesn't?...). I will use two types of eyedrops (one a steroid) regularly,\nbeginning right before the first infusion. There are other unsavory potential side effects\ntoo: neuropathy, GI issues, bone pain, fatigue and nausea etc. But I will try to move\nforward 'courageously,' as Dr. Patel encourages me to do. He seems ready for this new\nchallenge, and that heartened me, too. Elahere has about a 30% effectiveness rate,\nagain according to a study I read. As a a folate receptor alpha directed antibody and microtubule\ninhibitor conjugate (can some scientist remind me what this means?), it acts differently than the previous\nchemo drugs I've been treated with. From what I understand, it is much more 'targeted,' affixing itself directly\nto cancer cells rather than being released diffusely into the blood stream.  In any event, I'm scheduled\nto have my first infusion this coming Friday provided the medication arrives in time. If it\ndoesn't, the infusion will need to be rescheduled for the following week. I should be able\nto have all the infusions here and not at Hopkins, because it turns out we are able to get\nthe medication here soon. And we received word from Highmark that the cost will be\ncovered (yay!), although I don't know what the copay will be. Hopefully reasonable.\nI also joined an online discussion group exclusively for women on Elahere; it's proving\nfairly helpful.\nDr. Patel and I also discussed the significant persistent discomfort I'm having on my right\nside, the issue that sent me to the ER a few weeks ago. He believes it is due to cancer in\nthe pleura (lining/coating of the lung). A heat pad helps, but damn it's uncomfortable and\nI pray that Elahere can target some of the cancer there. In the meantime, the usual:\nTylenol, Oxycodone.\nThen it was off to the eye doctor this past Tuesday to have my eyes checked. I was\nhappy to learn that my optometrist, Dr. Nelson, has been getting herself up to speed\nabout Elahere too (for subsequent visits, every three weeks, we agreed that I would see\nthe ophthalmologist in the group, Dr. Marcovich). Dr. Nelson's eye exam revealed a fairly\nsignificant worsening of the vision in my left eye, which I had also detected, likely due to\nthe cataracts we had discussed at my last visit in January. \"The next step is cataract\nsurgery,\" she said. Oy gevalt! On top of everything! We agreed, though, that we'd wait\n                    \nto see what kind of damage Elahere does (or doesn't) before further discussing cataract\nsurgery.\nFive sessions of brain radiation are also coming up. I expect a call early this week to set\nthem up, hopefully for this week and next.\nI do wonder how much further the cancer can progress before it really begins to\nincapacitate me.\nWell, let's get on with it.\nDespite this (bleak? overwhelming? how does it seem to you?) account of the upcoming\ntreatment plan, all in all I've been in pretty good spirits recently and have enjoyed some\nlovely moments with friends: a really good talk with a friend (two, actually) currently\nconfronting health challenges due to disease. I feel a deep kinship with these friends,\nalmost as if they're the only ones who can truly understand what I'm experiencing\n(physically, emotionally, psychologically); lovely Sunday dinner at my friends' Maria and\nGreg's new condo, complete with 'Mama Rose's' (Maria's mom's) lasagna and meatballs\nand Italian sausage in red sauce. A lively pre-Easter dinner party at friends' last night, a\ncouple of curly-headed boy toddlers running about (adorable!); fabulous food, featuring\nsome of the Mexican dishes my (Mexican-born) friend/colleague excels at: ceviche,\nguacamole, salsa macha (a discovery). Glazed pork roasts that John scouted out in\n\"Trump country\" (i.e. from a butcher way out in the boonies, although not too far from\nhere, who had just slaughtered the pig!). And lots of texts, emails and zooms with dear\nones. And Ben (who turned twenty-eight on the 4th) and Sammi (whose birthday is\nupcoming in early May) are home from Europe! They had a great time visiting Lisbon,\nskiing in the Tyrol, and hanging out in Vienna as Sammi finished up her stay there. They\ntentatively plan to visit for Mother's Day and stay for a while. Other visits on the horizon\nas well.\nI want to report on Passover in another blog post. And also - in yet another post? - to\nremember the Easter Sunday four years ago when a young ER doc at our local Mount\nNittany Medical Center, visibly shaken, conveyed to me that CT-scan imaging had\nrevealed sizeable masses in my pelvic and abdominal areas. The promise of 'redemption'\nthat Easter holds out seemed like a bad joke to me that day, and I am grateful to have\nspent this sunny Easter Sunday relaxing, although not discomfort-free.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "Tomorrow beginning at 9 a.m. I'm having my first infusion of Elahere. While normally\nthat drug is infused for only thirty minutes, Dr. Patel has booked six hours for this first\ntreatment, between premeds (Benadryl, Zofran, Tylenol etc.), a titrated infusion of\nElahere, postmeds, and then a two-hour infusion of magnesium as my level remains\nchronically low. In preparation for tomorrow, I've begun taking the two prescribed eye\ndrops, one a steroid, the other artificial tears. As I was instructed to give myself the\nsteroid drops every four hours, I had to jolt myself out of a deep sleep at 2 and 6 a.m. I\nhave to rinse and repeat for about a week, while also lubricating with artificial tears at\nleast four times a day. Today I feel foggy... although sitting in the sun (an unseasonable\n84 degrees!) at lunch with my friend Kathryn felt relaxing. A FB page I joined for women\non Elahere is pushing the consensus many of them came to individually: take the steroid\neye drops during waking hours so as not to compromise sleep. I'd *love* this, but need\nto check w/Dr. Patel first. If I can handle having my lung drained at 4 a.m., giving myself\ninjections for many months, draining fluid from my stomach area into bags dangling from\nmy body (also for many months), being life flighted to Hopkins, surviving a thirteen-hour\ndebulking surgery, a nine-hour fistula repair, and removal of a brain tumor....well then, I\ncan probably handle feeling groggy for a week every three weeks.\nI simply don't want to leave the party.\nI'll stay on Elahere (once every three weeks) until a)it proves ineffective (tbd via CT-scan,\nI'm not sure when) or b)I cannot tolerate the drug.\nAnd my next round of brain radiation begins next Tuesday: five sessions spread over the\nnext two weeks. If these treatments proceed as they did the first two times the side\neffects were minimal. I remember some fatigue but that's about it. We are treating four\n(I believe) very small (1-2 mm) cancerous spots, not tumors, so the effects should\nnormally be proportionally less disruptive and fewer.\nI'm *marginally* more hopeful about Elahere as it belongs to a new class of drugs, more\ntargeted than their predecessors. But I have a lot of cancer in me. But there may be\nscary side effects. Heading into year five of treatment while my disease has continued to\nprogress, I will only say  for now: \"we'll see.\" Damn that pernicious, aggressive\ncarcinoma sarcoma that started it all.\n****\nMary Quant has died! As much of the late-1960s 'swinging sixties,' hippie and 'mod'\ncultures trickled down to me and my friends when were in our early teens, I remember\nour being enthralled by Mary Quant's vivid palette and 'flower power' iconography when\nwe were just beginning to express our individuality (or, conversely, faddishness) with\n                    \nclothes and makeup. I could have sworn I boasted some Mary Quant of my own, but\nlooking back at the info sheet I put together after my thirteenth birthday party in 1972, I\nsee that, along with incense burners, scented candles, Snoopy stickers, a poster, and\nstationery, my friends Eva & Zia gifted me not Mary Quant but the brand that remains\nintertwined with Mary's in my mind: Biba! No doubt I loved the plum eyeshadow and\nmulberry nail polish that I would attempt to transform into (especially as I headed\ntowards high school)  a kind of goth (goth before goth), vixen-like, vampy, Stevie Nicks\nwannabe look. I also see that Zia and Eva gave me (along with Revlon mascara and\n'lemon lotion'), a Yardley Pot o' Gloss, when Yardley also conjured London Mod and lip\ngloss was becoming all the rage. As with the genie's bottle, memories of those bygone\nlate 1960s/early 1970s (a particular source of nostalgia for me, perhaps because\nexperienced as the gateway to my teens) tumble from my Yardley lip gloss pot and Biba\neye shadow compact.\nPhotos",

Please know how much I appreciate every kind gesture and thought; I'm a\nlucky girl!\nAll went fine today. The procedure did not differ from what I'm used to: 2-hour\nmagnesium drip, pre-meds and solution (saline, Benadryl, Tylenol, Decadron, Zofran),\ntitrated Elahere drip (2 hours?). I spent six hours in the chair (and up and down a bit), ate\nsome lunch, dozed, sent a few texts. Dr. Patel swung by to see how I was doing; he\nindicated that I might shorten the time between each dose of steroid eye drops to enable\nme to have a (less) interrupted sleep. having been jolted out of a deep sleep at 2 and 6\na.m. the past two nights has done a real number on my circadian rhythms. My excellent\nnurse, Brianne (who feels like a friend by this point), had been prepped extensively on\nmy treatment and there were no glitches whatsoever. Many thanks to Helen for the ride\nto chemo this morning (the opportunity for a quick catch-up!), to Jackie for picking me up\n(and swinging by Meyer's Dairy for the ritual post-chemo root beer float), and to Michael,\nfor bringing me dinner tonight (luscious grilled lamb chops, mashed potatoes and\nzucchini).

    "entry": "Thank you to everyone who's been checking on me this week. I'm hanging in. While\nElahere has not been 'a walk in the park' so far, the side effects have been manageable.\nI've only had one day I would qualify as 'bad,' two days after my first infusion: GI issues,\nabdominal discomfort, diarrhea, dehydration and fatigue. I couldn't do much more than\nrest that day. Abdominal discomfort has continued but is under control; staying hydrated\nas best I can and now taking Immodium (and soon, Lomotil). I also started my third\ncourse of brain radiation today (!). Like the first two, it makes for a most uncomfortable\n20-30 minutes as I'm literally bolted to the table by a tight plastic head mask (with a\nnose hole for breathing, of course, very _Silence of the Lambs;_ speaking of which, a\nheavily-guarded prisoner in an orange jumpsuit sat manacled in the waiting room,\nawaiting his radiation treatment after mine!). I didn't realize I was so tired from the\nradiation-chemo double whammy until I slept away most of the afternoon after I came\nhome. As hard wired as I am to feel pissed off about being 'unproductive,' I know I need\nmy 'sleep cure.'\nTaking my different medications at the right time(s) (not my forte) is somewhat\nchallenging, but I'm managing that too. The first five days of my chemo cycle, I was\ngiving myself steroid eye drops six times a day and artificial tears (at least) four times a\nday (it turns out I've been using the wrong type of artificial tears and had to buy new\nones - preservative free - today). After five days, I've dropped to steroid eye drops four\ntimes a day and artificial tears (at least) four times a day. Soon I'll use only artificial tears\nuntil the next infusion. All this involves getting up at least once during the night for the\ndrops. And there must be at least ten minutes between the two types of drops! On top of\nthis, I have to take an oral steroid an hour before each radiation session. My head is\nspinning. I joined a FB page for Elahere users and it's proved quite helpful. Another\nwoman and I are basically keeping pace with one another (we had our first infusion on\nthe same day), and have been updating one another on how we're doing.\nThe discomfort on my side (pleura/ribs/lung?) has not abated and seems to stretch\naround to my back. A heat pad provides relief. What is the end game in terms of this\nparticular hurt? I'll talk to my oncologist about it this week.\nYes, I'll see Dr. Patel on Friday. His nurse, Kayla, called me today to check on me and\nrecommend medication for my abdominal discomfort. I was grateful for her call.\nAll pretty exciting, huh? It's the end of the school year - my favorite time of year when I\nwas teaching - and I wish I were on campus for the various student awards ceremonies,\ndissertation defenses, commencement, and celebratory rituals that helped power us\nthrough all the final grading, tired but happy. And a row of hyacinths (or maybe lilacs?)\nalong \"Deans' Walk\" on campus perfumes the air divinely in late April. I've nicely been\ninvited to attend a few defenses via Zoom, will take a favorite student to lunch next\n                    \nweek, and will be on hand to help celebrate an esteemed colleague's (and friend's!)\nretirement. So at least I will have a taste of end of year if I can't be more squarely in the\nmix.\nWill need to try to do something fun this weekend. Get together with friends. Cook or\nbake (I am awaiting the first stalks of rhubarb and asparagus with bated...taste buds).\nTake a drive. Watch a movie. Look forward to late April/May visitors, including Ben and\nSammi for Mothers Day, and zoom visits with a few friends on the west coast.\nTime to go watch the Knicks.",

    "entry": "Elahere came back to bite me this past weekend, after a week of relatively smooth\nsailing. Felt like some devil had gotten into my intestines and was squeezing, twisting,\nand pulling. My entire GI system was cramping, rolling waves of intense discomfort (as\nopposed to sharp pain). And fatigue. And nausea. And diarrhea. I could barely drag\nmyself to the couch Saturday and Sunday, where a heating pad numbed some of the\ncramping while I steadied myself for the next wave of pain. A cocktail of Trazadone,\nOxycodone and Tylenol PM (ok'd by my doctors) helped me sleep -- for fourteen hours\nFriday night. No appetite, have hardly eaten anything in close to four days (and am\nabout four pounds lighter) but have been keeping hydrated. Tonight I'll have some\nChinese chicken noodle soup; the warm broth is appealing.\nInitially, I couldn't figure out the source of my discomfort. Elahere? A stomach or\nintestinal blockage? Consequently, I couldn't figure out how to treat it. Antacid?\nImmodium? Nothing? Liquid diet? A trip to the ER (which I was seriously considering)? I\ndecided to query the online chat group for Elahere users that I recently joined. Several\nwomen confirmed that they had experienced the exact same symptoms as I was having.\nOne said she simply relied on Tylenol to provide relief. Another reported powering\nthrough on Oxycodone. So I experimented with taking some Oxycodone during the day\n(and not just 5 mg at night, when I usually take it); that helped. Today I'm feeling\nsomewhat better but not completely. It's a reminder to me that these symptoms can hit\nunexpectedly.\nI was in so much physical distress that I questioned whether I was \"fighting to live\"\nrather than \"living to fight.\" My thought was that if this distress continued through the\nthree cycles of Elahere before CT-scan, I would call it quits at that point. But today I felt a\nbit better and I put away that thought.\nI was also at the hospital for two radiation treatments this past week (with three more\nupcoming this T, Th and Fr). I only experience fatigue from radiation, although three\ntreatments in one week may be a rough go. Instead of asking to keep tuned to the overly\nmellow playlist piped into the radiation room, with Peter, Paul and Mary crooning about\n\"leaving on a jet plane,\" I requested 70s' r&b and disco! As I was being bolted to the\ntable, KC and the Sunshine Band were teasing, \"That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it,\nuh huh uh huh.\" All I could think was \"This is NOT the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it. I do\nNOT like this at all, nuh huh nuh huh!!\"\nOn Friday I met with Dr. Patel to assess how my treatment is going so far. At this point,\nhe's all about my living my best life: \"Just go, go, go, just do, do, do!\" Even Paris if I feel\nup to it, which remains to be seen. The one matter I'm concerned about (he seemed less\nso, although he's keeping an eye on it), are two elevated liver markers (ALT and AST),\nindicating liver damage. They may be elevated as an effect of the Elahere, the cancer, or\n                    \nsome combination. It's imperative that I keep well hydrated. The thought of liver damage\nmakes me anxious.\nDespite not feeling well, I managed to rally to keep all my weekend plans: a lovely\nretirement reception and dinner for a spectacular colleague in English, my friend Cheryl;\na play, _Emilia,_ with my friend Maria, about a female poet of Shakespeare's day, largely\nlost to history; and a catch-up visit from my friend Monique. I also made my first batch of\nthe season of strawberry-rhubarb sauce, and bought raw cream off a farm to serve with\nit. My 'rhubarb reconnaissance mission' took place on a glorious April day - fields the\ncolor of limes, early blooms in purple, yellow, and beige -- that had me headed to the\nlarge Belleville Wednesday market (ignore all the awful Trump flags and firearms for\nsale! head straight for the rhubarb!) and meandering along back roads. \"Whan that April\nwith his showres soote....\" I still remember those fifty first lines of the Prologue to _The\nCanterbury Tales_ that my schoolmates and I had to memorize, and I'll bet they do too!\nI'm very excited for the visit of my grade school friends, Zia and Eva, this weekend.\nThey'll take Amtrak from New York. We'll open the voluminous archives -- letters,\njournals, photos, notes, stories, 'birthday books' and more we've kept and exchanged\nover the years -- and revel in this precious circle of life moment. \nPhotos",

I am super excited about their visit, which will involve a good\namount of 'hanging' and reminiscing via our abundant personal 'archives' (especially as\nrain is predicted all weekend).\n                    \nI am done with my third course of radiation! Fifteen treatments in all, targeting spots in\nmy brain. Everything seems to have gone well and I'll have an MRI in three months, for\nreimaging. I'm not sensing any cognitive deterioration at all (as mentioned, Dr. Patel the\nYounger and the man known only as The Physicist target the spots ultra-precisely so as\nnot to damage any healthy tissue). As always, I simply feel tired (however, the steroid I\ntake before the treatment is guaranteed to mess with my sleep tonight, as it did last\nnight, as it will next Friday night post-chemo). Dr. Patel hopes he won't have to see me\nagain for more radiation (as do I), but we'll always be keeping an eye on it.\nFor my musical pleasure during radiation, yesterday I requested all Bob Marley and\ntoday all Handel. I felt Handel would work well on this rainy day (>calming, melodious)\nfollowing a night of poor sleep (>rousing and uplifting>_Water Music!_).\nI've been lubricating my eyes diligently and hope the next infusion (a week from today)\nwill not bring about any of the ocular toxicity I've been fearing.\nMonday I'll have a long infusion -- two hours of fluids + two hours of magnesium. I'm\nglad to be receiving hydration this way as, no matter how much I drink (and I likely could\ndrink more, although I try!) I still tend to feel dehydrated.\nFun stuff this week: attended via Zoom the (successful) dissertation defense of a student\nI worked closely with until I retired; W lunch at India Pavilion with a favorite undergrad,\nsoon to be a graduate and off to work for a year as a public educator at Neuengamme\nconcentration camp; beer and quesadillas creekside at Voodoo Lounge with my friend\nTed (who eons ago was my student); cooking (more strawberry-rhubarb sauce; soon:\ncream of asparagus soup!).\nI seem to be encountering a striking number of folks (in my approximate age range)\ndealing with different types of cancers right now. Did we work so hard to be successful in\nour careers and parenting that our immune systems were compromised? What is going\non?? I wish every one of them a return to wholeness of body and spirit.\nLunch this coming Tuesday with my dear '3Cs;' very much looking foward.\nShabbat shalom everyone.",

    "entry": "Health update: unfortunately, still hindered by debilitating GI discomfort, a side effect of\nElahere, but trying to stay glued together with Oxycodone and Tylenol. Rest, heat pad\nhelp; had two-hour infusion of fluids on Monday for extra hydration. At the same time,\nallowing myself to feel a *smidgen* of hopefulness on seeing a)my magnesium level\nclimb to almost normal (it's been as low as .9 and as high, this past Monday, as 1.4;\nanything 1.5 or above is considered normal and I'd been hovering at 1.2 or 1.3 for\nweeks); b)my liver enzyme markers (ALT and AST) plummet (a good thing) where the\nprevious week they'd been alarmingly high; c)something else that I deem 'tmi' in this\ncontext but that is normally a sign of improved liver/pancreatic health. So tomorrow I'll\nstart prepping for infusion #2 of Elahere on Friday: lab work; steroid eye drops and\nartificial tears 6x/day. Praying my eyes (specifically, my corneas) are not affected;\nhoping for no worsening of neuropathy, GI woes etc. For now, I won't create worries.\nUpdate (Thursday): good liver enzyme marker numbers maintained after labs this\nmorning.\n*******\nWith Mercury appearing, as it does right now, to travel backward across the sky, we\nshould refrain from embarking on new endeavors, signing contracts, succumbing to\ntravel mishaps, and over-relying on technology. This much my girlhood friends, Eva and\nZia, and I agreed upon as we revisited our common belief in astrology en route to the\ntrain station in Lewistown. Instead, this may well be a propitious time to look backwards,\ntake stock, review past errors -- which is exactly what we did during our magical\nweekend together.\nAs became clear over the weekend, both my friends have 'reviewed past errors' over the\ndecades, whether in their personal, professional, or familial lives-- and conquered them\nwith accomplishments, mental, physical and emotional grit, courage, clear-sightedness,\nand intelligence . It's not been easy. All three of us are confronting health challenges\nright now. I think we're pretty badass.\nI am so proud of these women.\nWe were eleven (in 1971) when we met (Eva and Zia had just enrolled in our private\ngirls' school in NYC and had even had acting roles in a movie, _Savages,_ before that; I\nhad attended Nightingale since second grade); we soon became the closest of friends. I\nmust have been drawn to these girls with such interesting heritages (Indian: Zia; German-\nIraqi: Eva). These girls with the larger than life mothers: Zia's is Madhur Jaffrey; my dog-\neared copy of _An Invitation to Indian Cooking_ introduced me (and likely millions of\nother Americans) to a spectacular world of tastes, smells, colors, and spices; Eva's mom,\nAngelika Saleh, lent her name to the legendary cutting-edge art movie house on Houston\nSt. \n                    \nThe anticipated centerpiece of the weekend was a plunge into our pasts, via dozens and\ndozens of letters exchanged among Zia, Eva and myself from ages eleven to eighteen\n(1971-78), sent from Delhi, Germany, New York, Amherst, MA (where my father taught\nsummer school one year), Maine, the Hamptons (an au pair gig for Zia), Cambridge, MA.\nMissives communicated on every variety of stationery: air letters, cute writing paper\ndecorated with lemons (and smelling of them too), birds, hearts, flowers (is stationery\neven a 'thing,' anymore?); as a teen, I fill up every available cm of paper with my writing,\nas I still do! Photos, diaries, and documents -- among them Zia's meticulously prepared\n'data sheet' on the science teacher many of us were crushing  on, Mr. Mann, which\nconveyed such observations as \"Likes water,\" and detailed our forays to his apartment\nbuilding where we got on our bellies in front of his apartment door and tried to\ndetect...any signs of movement within from the slit on the bottom. The driving rain this\npast weekend provided the perfect backdrop for this memory plunge (punctuated by two\ndelicious dinners featuring Indian shrimp and also cauliflower, thanks to Zia), and we\nveered between convulsive laughter (the Mr. Mann document), tears, incredulousness,\nand fascination. Was this really us?\nSaturday night, I went to bed around 11, leaving Eva and Zia to begin scanning the\nletters until 2 a.m.; I awoke the next morning to  find my friends in the exact same spot\nin my sunroom, scanning away on just a few hours of sleep! Such an act of love and\nremembrance. If I had more time (ie a longer life expectancy), I'd consider drawing on\nour archive to craft a longer piece.  My historian's skill set would come in handy but how\nto render the emotional charge of all this?\nWe are constantly self-berating and apologetic: for our 'sloppy' handwriting; for the pen\nthat is running out of ink, our 'boring' summer, our 'boring' news (Zia: \"Well, don't fall\nasleep...;\" Eva from Munich: \"I'm getting really bored here;\" Eva from New York: \"I'm\nvery bored here, but Zia will be here soon;.\" Eva finds her letter to me so boring that \"I\nshould have told you in the beginning to rip it up.\"). Zia claims to be \"getting uglier by\nthe minute.\" Was this a sort of 'trope' of our correspondence or were we really so lacking\nin confidence? I worry.\nWe are touchingly, almost desperately loyal, constantly proclaiming our status as best\nfriends (Zia: \"I'm so glad you write, for I have never had a more faithful friend;\" \"Always,\nlet's be friends, of the best kind.\"); fretting about what it might 'mean' when\nexperiencing radio (or rather, epistolary) silence from one of our classmates (\"all my so-\ncalled friends are not writing!\"), as during the summers in which we were totally\ndependent on the mail service for communication; always on guard for 'betrayals' should\none of our classmates turn on us (this did indeed happen, as revealed in a shunning\nletter one of the popular girls in our class of twenty-five sent to me and Zia, and perhaps\nEva). In no uncertain terms and in the written equivalent of a scream, she advised us to\n\"FORGET IT\" (ie having a friendship), since we apparently had placed certain conditions\n                    \non this relationship. Mean girls - wow. \"ARE YOU STILL MY BEST FRIEND??\"\nWe are semi-tuned in to current events, the Watergate trials and Nixon's resignation in\nAugust 1974 topping the list --  scandals that Zia, last weekend, correctly deemed\n'quaint' by today's standards.\nWe are precious, precocious, and pretentious (yet in retrospect, impressive!) young\nteens. Zia, at fourteen, is reading Hemingway (as am I, apparently: \"you too have been\nreading Hemingway\"), Hugo's _Les Mis\u00e9rables,_ Paton's _Cry, the Beloved Country,_\nTruman Capote, and  _The Chosen,_ yet she finds the portable Faulkner \"a bit much\"\n(LOL). I'm trying to convince her to appreciate Renoir, whom I've recently discovered: Zia\nfinally demurs after viewing his work at the National Gallery in London: \"He certainly was\ntalented\" (LOL). Both these fourteen-year-olds will become writers and teachers, though\nof slightly different ilks. Eva is playing Mozart sonatas with her grandfather in Germany. \nStrong, smart, talented, and insightful, she'll remain engaged with film for many years\nbefore becoming a successful insurance broker specializing in personal property in the\nHamptons.\nWe are children of the 1970s: \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" the Carpenters, the Beatles'\n_Revolver,_ incense burners, candles, Biba eye shadow, bell bottoms, catch phrases (\"ya\ndig?!\").\nWe  constantly have sleep-overs at one another's houses. We have lots of crushes.\nThere is something about a \"rhinoceros' toenail,\" alluded to several times in the letters,\nthat we all find side-splittingly funny.\nWe have nicknames for one another: I am \"Susi\" (why?), 'Willie,' and 'Willy,' Eva is 'Evy.'\nI am so grateful for these girls.\nI am so grateful for these friendships.\nIt occurs to me in writing that perhaps our childhoods -- or the fragments of them that\nlive on to spark further memory -- weren't all that unusual. Maybe they're not even all\nthat different, in some ways, from those of NYC girls today attending one of several girls'\nprivate schools on the UES.\nSo what was so special about my childhood?\nIt was mine.\n******\n                    \nCoda: Zia, fifty-two years ago: \"Are you saving all your letters from me? I'm keeping all\nof yours.\"\n \nPhotos",

It flooded me\nwith my own memories - you coming to the Berkshires with my family and me going\nskiing with Eva\u2019s. The party with your much older boyfriend, eating marzipan at Eva\u2019s\nkitchen table. The gatherings at my house when my parents left for the weekend.\nI love your wordage and perceptions. I realize that I framed things differently, being\nnewer on the scene and from a much larger school. I thought of all of us as popular\nbecause we all spent time together. I thought of a couple of classmates as more\nsophisticated or more quiet, as liking me more or liking me less - but all of us in it\ntogether.

I put my heart & soul into it! As I said to Jill,\nyour name came up several times and we looked at some photos in which you appear.\nStrangely, I don't remember coming to the Berkshires w/your family (memory is so\nselective that way!). I *do* remember the gatherings at your apartment when we were\n'home alone.' My much older artist boyfriend, Clay (who lived in a loft in Soho when that\nneighborhood was still quite bohemian), was all of 27 when I met him at 18, ie younger\nthan my son Ben is now, but he seemed to me at the time so much older and more\nworldly. He was my link to the 60s' and told me about the 'summer of love.' Maybe you\nand I will reminisce more when we zoom on Saturday. I appreciate your insights!\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, May 4, 2023  \nWhat a wonderful report\u2026and your nostalgia is entirely contagious! Mr. Mann! The\nscience lab! The first computer with dot-matrix printer! And the depth and loyalty and\n                    \noccasional imbalance of all those long-ago friendships. I had to worry for a moment that I\nwas the author of the \u201cFORGET IT\u201d letter, but then saw it came from one of the \u201cpopular\ngirls\u201d and breathed a sigh of relief. In any case I\u2019m so glad you had the chance to revel in\none another. Those years were of course a fraction of what we\u2019ve all gotten to live since,\nbut didn\u2019t they last so much longer and stay so much more vivid than similar stretches of\ntime?\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, May 4, 2023  \nI'm so glad you enjoyed reading this piece, Lisa. I meant it as a homage not just to\nEva and Zia and our friendship but indeed to *all* of us and those important 'growing up'\nyears we spent together, learning about friendship among many other lessons. No, you\nwere not the author of the \"FORGET IT\" letter. But somehow I have you in mind as a\n'popular girl' - no? That enormous, clunky, dot-matrix printer and computer -- and Mr.\nCohen, who also taught us Physics, running around looking completely harried as he\ntried to teach us the basics of coding. Your name came up at several points during the\nweekend, most fondly. xo\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, May 9, 2023  \nWhat a magical weekend! So lovely to hear about it\u2014thanks for sharing!

And what a trip to dive back into those early\nteenage years and see how we saw the world at that time. Friendship certainly meant\neverything to us, and it still means everything to me today. I feel blessed to have you\nand Zia as good friends! ... I'm glad to hear you've had a couple of good reports lately\n(magnesium and liver enzymes).

Sending love and positivity your way, dear\nWilla! xoxo\n  \u2014Eva Saleh, May 4, 2023  \nWhat a wonderful walk down memory lane. I loved the memory of Mr Mann. I wonder if\nyou remember him announcing to the class \"welcome to the male reproductive system\"\nto which Shelley Tupper promptly stood up and in her most seductive teenage voice\nreplied \"welcome to the female reproductive system\". So glad you had such a\nheartwarming visit with such dear friends. Lots of love, S\n  \u2014Sarah Robinson, May 5, 2023  \n                    \nOh Sarah, so glad you enjoyed reading this. You definitely came up in\nconversation, but I'm not sure we corresponded. That memory of Mr. Mann is a hoot! I\ndon't recall that incident, but can definitely imagine Shelly pulling it off. I *do* remember\none of us sticking a wrapped tampon in a test tube and placing on his desk in\nanticipation of his arrival in the lab where we were all assembled for class. Poor Mr.\nMann; we were quite a handful... Lots of love to you, W\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, May 6, 2023  \nWhat fun to be allowed to share your girlhood intimacies and how fortunate you are to\nbe able to get together again! Reminds me for the Nth time how sad today's youth are\nnot to write real tangible letters. I have a number of letters from my old friends (some I\nmyself wrote for some reason) and I marvel at their length and the neatness of our\nwriting.\nOf course, it's no accident you have so many supportive and caring friends from every\nstage of your life, including now. You're reaping the rewards of a lifetime of nurturing\nthose loving friendships - What treasures!\n(Read recently that everyone's handwriting is deteriorating these days because nobody\nwrites by hand anymore. What future scholars will ever be able to research for\nbiographies of favorite authors or other heroes, looking up \"Collected Emails of So and\nSo\"? Or worse, tweets or text messages?)\nVery glad about the hopeful lab results! (FWIW Whenever my liver enzymes have been\nelevated it's turned out to be quite related to dehydration.) And dreading with you the\ncoming Elahere treatments, hoping for them soon to be mere memories. Thank heavens\nfor that support group you found to compare notes and share experiences with those\ncomrades. Those radiation treatments (the masks and being bolted down) made me\nshiver. While reviewing your worst fears, I add my own super positive wishes for you to\nescape the corneal damage that new chemo treatment sometimes inflicts (but often\nNOT!)\nSorry for the on-going GI discomfort, Thank goodness for your favorite milkshakes at\nleast, which still seem to be going down well. Hope the pains and digestive issues can be\noptimally identified and alleviated. Your reports of your worst pains - that night you\nfound yourself questioning whether it was worth the struggle, saddened me deeply.\nBut without sticking it out then you couldn't have enjoyed your recent reunion with your\noldest friends, including reviewing those many decades of precious correspondence! I'm\nsure you are savoring to the last drops every get together, and every special delight you\nrecount so beautifully be they exquisite birthday cakes, the greening of the PA Spring (so\nmany blossoms!) and every single uplifting conversation.\n                    \nAnd still finding so many opportunities to giggle and reminisce!\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, May 6, 2023  \n  \nMay 4, 2023 - 1973-77 (photos)",

    "entry": "Thankfully, I seem to have averted, so far, the worst side effects of last Friday's infusion\n(my second with Elahere): the horrendous stomach cramps that felt like a massage of\nmy intestines  -- and not in a good way. I do have some stomach discomfort and bad\ndiarrhea (hopefully not tmi? Cancer has made me lose any iota of  embarrassment  I\never had about my body and its functions!). This last symptom also means dehydration\nthat I'm always trying to combat, and  may call for another infusion of fluids, like last\ntime. Otherwise, I'm fatigued, but that symptom's been worse before, too.\nNext infusion: Friday, May 26. Then, presumably, a scan. I'll be curious/anxious for the\n                    \nresults. Some women in the Elahere FB group I joined are reporting improvements,\nothers not. As Elahere may be my 'chemo of last resort,' I'll be directing my fervent\nwishes towards stabilization or reduction of my cancer load. Needless to say, a 'cure' is\noff the table. My goal is to stay alive and enjoy a decent quality of life.\nI really want to sneak off to Paris for a week or ten days after my third infusion. Maybe?\nI felt well enough yesterday to briefly attend a brunch in honor of one of my former, and\nfavorite, students, Casey, whose career at Penn State has been nothing short of\nphenomenal. I worked with her as a freshman in my course on France and the Holocaust\nin Film and Literature (she also participated in the Holocaust-focused weeklong trip to\nParis I led over spring break 2019 - right before I was diagnosed). A student in the\nSchreyer Honors College here (from which Ben also graduated), Casey has taken\nadvantage of every opportunity to learn, grow, and investigate future career\npossibilities; this led her to study abroad experiences in Paris, Poland (a Holocaust-\nfocused trip), Israel (archaeological dig), and Cura\u00e7ao (museum work). She won first\nprize from the PSU libraries for her BA/MA thesis on Jewish communities in central\nPennsylvania. Next year she'll be a public educator at Neuengamme concentration\ncamp. In any event, It was delightful to be able to honor Casey and also to feel a bit back\n'in the mix.' It made me realize how much I miss and feel energized by helping students\nachieve their goals.\nI've made a nice connection through the online Elahere group: a woman named Karen\nwhose treatment follows the exact same schedule as mine (she also had her second\ninfusion of Elahere last Friday and we are checking in with one another about side\neffects). Karen is a poet living in the Boston area. I read several of her poems about\ncancer online and find them quite affecting: https://donyorty.com/2023/04/30/karen-\nfriedland-reads-from-incurable-inoperable-poems-and-notes-from-a-deadly-diagnosis/. It\nfeels comforting to be in lockstep with another Elahere user/kindred spirit of sorts. We\nseem to have a lot in common!\nI greatly look forward to Ben and Sammi's visit this weekend. They usually prepare a nice\nMothers Day breakfast for us (I couldn't resist ordering some very pretty petits fours\nfrom The Cakeshop by Tati), which we'll follow with a jaunt in the country (to discover\none of PA's charming covered bridges? a greenhouse? an antiques store?) and perhaps a\nbeer at one of several new breweries in the area. Ben has made time to help me tick off\none of my very few bucket list items - any guesses? And Sammi and I will enjoy a girls'\nspa day at the lovely Omni Bedford Springs Resort, a haven for 'curists' in the late 19th\nc..",

    "entry": "It's strange how joy and suffering can coexist. \"Mayday!\" calls can pierce the stillness of\nthe most joyous, serene May days.\nOne morning last week, I awoke sensing that my eyesight had precipitously declined, as\nall surrounding me was a blur. I was fairly certain that a frightening side effect of\nElahere, ocular toxicity, had gotten hold of me and hung over me like the sword of\nDamocles. Strangely (or not), many of the women reporting this symptom pinpointed its\ninception at about ten days past the second infusion (this was my case too). Fortunately,\nI had an ophthalmologist appointment just a few days after this. Dr. Marcovitch\nconfirmed that both my corneas were damaged; the right one, he said, was damaged so\nbadly that it fell below the minimum strength legally required to drive. Fortunately in PA\nyou only need one 'good' eye to drive. I'm managing to drive when necessary, although\nmy eyesight's somewhat blurry; Ben and Sammi felt understandably nervous about my\ndriving back from the train station in Lewistown (about 25 miles away) after depositing\nSammi there, but I knew that if I couldn't get out and about on a beautiful May day, I'd\nbecome depressed. No amount of attempting to see clearly with glasses, without\nglasses, with or without sunglasses etc. really helps as my vision has changed so\nradically, so suddenly. But I'm managing. Dr. Marcovich advised me to get back on the\nsteroid eye drops four times a day, every day (instead of for only ten days out of the\nmonth); I'll go back to him on Monday and see if this has helped. I hope he will take\nsome time to get up to speed on my problem; he doesn't seem to know much about\nElahere and its effects (in fact, he had to Google information about it while I was there!).\nThis condition (keratitis is the generic name for corneal damage) is supposedly\nreversible; at the same time blindness is another potential side effect of Elahere\ninfusions (!) but I've not heard of anyone going blind from this drug. Talk about being\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis... Meanwhile, I'm forging ahead, like the Knight in _Monty\nPython and the Holy Grail,_ who remarks, after having his arm severely wounded and\nsquirting abundant blood in a sword fight, 'Tis but a scratch.' LOL.\n                    \nI'm supposed to have my third infusion next Friday but I suppose we'll have to see how\nmy eyes are faring. I'll see Dr. Marcovich again on Monday and he'll examine my\ncorneas. If there's still severe damage, I am not sure whether Dr. Patel will want to wait a\nweek or so until my eyes improve (presuming they improve), before proceeding to the\nnext infusion.\nI am also continuing to experience on and off the terrible GI cramping brought about by\nElahere, sometimes accompanied by chills (but no fever). It's tiring and I feel better\nwhen I'm experiencing this discomfort if I lie down. The cramping etc. has been so bad a\nfew times that I've thought of giving up, but then remind myself that the bad days are\n(usually, up to this point) followed by better/good ones. And when the good ones arrive,\nI'm angry at myself for even thinking of calling it quits.\nI'm putting the brakes on certain plans until the above-mentioned issues are resolved.\nWhile meeting with my palliative care doctor last week, she told me that a therapist\nspecializing in oncology patients has joined the oncology team at Geisinger. I have an\nappointment with her on the 31st as I'd like to see what she could bring to the table that\nmight help me. Although I have a very good therapist with whom I've worked with for\nover a decade and whom I see every other week, I am curious to explore this new\navenue too.\nMay days: Ben and Sammi temper the suffering with joy and bring much serenity,\nenergy, helpfulness, and happiness to our home. They helped make my Mother's Day\nwonderful, as we've been celebrating the holiday together the past several years. For\nbrunch, they made me farm fresh eggs (so yummy!) and bacon (also from a local farm),\nfruit salad, bagels, smoked salmon and cream cheese, and creamed herring and pickles\nfrom Shelsky's in Brooklyn. I bought, from the marvelous Cake Shop by Tati, the most\ndelightful and delicious petits fours, coated in icing and piped spring flowers, with moist\ncake layers separated by jam. We then sat by the creek in Spring Creek Park, enjoying\nthe sun and the pretty pastel colors of spring (green, pink, white). Following that, we\nreturned home where we caught the second half of the Celtics-76ers game (it's all about\nthe NBA playoffs in our house these days), then ventured out again to a new brewery in\ntown to enjoy a frosty beer in radiant sunshine. Despite all the satisfaction I garnered\nfrom my career (and my career was going gangbusters when I was diagnosed, sigh...), I\nstill think motherhood is the best gig ever and am eternally grateful for my child.\nTuesday Sammi and I enjoyed a 'girls spa day' at the Omni Bedford Springs Resort, about\na 1 1/4 hour drive from State College. My grad school besties Vinni and Isabelle, and I,\nhad spent two wonderful days last year hiking the trails on the property leading to\nvarious springs (which attracted all manner of 'curists and tourists' in the 19th century),\ndining in a nice Italian restaurant in the cute town of Bedford, cooking s'mores over an\noutdoor fire pit, drinking champagne, indulging in spa treatments and a wonderful\n                    \nvariety of baths and sauna, and purchasing a few of the spa's signature bath products,\nall honeysuckle based. One day not long ago I had the thought that a spa day would be a\nnice birthday treat for Sammi, a relaxing getaway for me, and an opportunity for me to\ncatch up in depth with Sammi about her recent year in Vienna. We both luxuriated in\n'spa pedicures' featuring all kinds of scrubs, rubs, lotions, leg massages, then polish (a\nMerlot color for me, pastel blue for Sammi). We ate lunch outside (pretty day but turned\na bit cloudy) and looked at some of the memorabilia in the historic hotel (the guest\nregister on display featured both Presidents James Buchanan and James Polk). Then we\nheaded back to the spa for a good hour of showering, soaking in both hot and cold tubs\nfeaturing jets directed at different body parts - shoulders, neck, lower back etc.,\nsweating in the sauna infused with eucalyptus oil, and finally relaxing in a tranquil room\nwith potted palms, comfy chaises, soft throw blankets, pitchers of cucumber water, fresh\nstrawberries... I think I snoozed a bit. Otherwise, we gabbed the whole time (Sammi\ndrove both ways due to my vision problems). It was delightful to spend the day with\nSammi.\nOn the way home, I stopped off to vote in our municipal elections. Every election is so\ncrucial. I'm pleased to see that a progressive slate of school board candidates won their\nelection.\nOn the way home from dropping Sammi off in Lewistown yesterday, I stopped at several\nfarms and the big farmers market in Belleville, found some good-looking asparagus from\nsomeone's uncle's farm. I've made asparagus soup and tonight am making an Ottolenghi\nasparagus salad with an interesting-sounding dressing/topping. Maybe an asparagus\ngalette soon?\nOther May days stuff: a visit from a dear friend I hadn't seen in quite a while; lunch at a\nVenezuelan place with my friend Kathryn followed by a walk in Thompson Woods\nPreserve, which I did not know about.\nTomorrow is 'bucket list' day. I hope it's fun and that I have the stamina for it. No,\nMelissa, it's not a ride in a hot-air balloon but that's a great guess! :)\n[Having difficult uploading pics. They will follow.]",

    "entry": "Over my many years of driving along backroads in central PA, I've delighted at the\nfigures, seen in miniature from afar, which render the surrounding landscapes\npicturesque and serene: Amish women stooped over to  hoe their vegetable gardens or\ncollect eggs from their chickens; farmers rolling up bales of hay; Amish children playing\nin the yard of a one-room schoolhouse or seated in a cart, led around the backyard by a\nminiature horse. These charming figures, a bit idealized and precious, always called to\nmind for me the residents of medieval fiefs illustrating the famous medieval book of\nhours, The Very Rich Hours of Jean, duc de Berry (Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures de Jean, duc de\nBerry) or, in an Art nouveau vein, the women picking flowers or raking leaves throughout\nthe year in the calendar illustrated by Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, Les Mois.\nIn the spring and fall, sightings of anglers in the network of creeks running through\nPenns Valley have also enchanted me. Casting, catching, or simply standing waist deep\nin the chilly creek, these solitary figures dotting the water, dappled by sunlight or\nshrouded in mist, seem enveloped in a blissful stillness, a state of Zen. Less ambitiously,\nkids and adults dangle all manner of fishing rods into the creek from embankments lining\nit.\nAnd so we arrive at my one and only bucket list experience (sure, there are lots of\nothers, but they're currently beyond my reach). Accompanied by Tess, our most\nexcellent guide, Ben and I spent the day learning how to fly fish for trout in a creek\nreputed internationally for this activity. At The Feathered Hook in Coburn, PA, ground\nzero for all things fly fishing in these parts -- which also boasts a bed and breakfast and a\nlodge for the many anglers both skilled and novice, corporate groups, and others -- we\nwere given waders, extremely heavy boots, and a wading stick. Tess took us to a spot\nthat she intuited would yield trout (catch and release). She explained why Penn's Creek,\nwhich is something like twenty-seven miles long, is such an appealing body of water for\nanglers: a microclimate filled with the types of insects trout like to feed on, for example,\nand ultra-clean water boasting a specific Ph-level. Once we had entered the creek and\nwalked to about the middle of it (a folding chair was an enormous help for me), Tess\ntaught us the basics of casting relying on something called \"European technique,\" which\nseemed so complicated initially that I almost gave up before we started (\"nevertheless,\nshe persisted\"). The exact positioning of the rod and the fishing line, of the body in\nrelation to the water, the speed at which the line is dragged through the water, every\ndetail is calibrated. Getting the fish in the net once caught seemed to require even more\nprecision. Tess gave Ben a bit more instruction than me (as I had expected); advising\nhim to take three steps to the left, one step forward, etc. and to cast his rod towards a\nrippling and roiling spot, which the fish apparently like because of the oxygen pockets it\ncreates. He looked very much the natural. I was perfectly content to sit in my folding\nchair casting, although I did change position several times (my badly compromised\nvision, about which more later, was a challenge). I took several breaks from fishing to\n                    \nsimply savor the environment: the clear, cold water; birds chirping; verdant trees lining\neach bank; and blue sky (until it turned cloudy). We bantered with the anglers walking\nby, asking how many fish we had caught.\nWe caught five! Ben 4, Willa 1. Ben caught one rainbow trout and three brown trout.\nGorgeous fish, with silky skin dappled with brown spots. I was *amazed* that I caught a\nfish, a small, speckled brown trout. Tess skillfully taught us how to work our rods until\nshe could maneuver the fish into the net.\nWe sat on an embankment and ate lunch. As part of our 'package,' Tess brought subs,\ndrinks and all kinds of snacks. She lives half the year in Bozeman, MT, and fishes out\nthere too, leading workshops for women anglers (or wannabe anglers) -- a great idea as\nthe sport seems quite male-dominated. We found no lack of common interests\n(progressive politics - yay! - cooking, Penn State, life in central PA etc.). She was so\nfriendly and such a good teacher.\nWe called it quits around 3:00 as we were tiring (once again, I seemed to 'rise to the\noccasion' in terms of stamina; I actually could have kept going a bit longer). I found the\nexperience of fly fishing enticing. I'd love to get out there again and spend the day\nsitting in the middle of that cool creek, casting my rod (might be a bit of a challenge on\nmy own, though....). The monotony didn't bother me; on the contrary, I found it calming. \nSo maybe one day you'll find that I've hung a shingle on my front doo: Gone fishin'....\nSo that's my 'big fish' story!\n******\nUnfortunately, my vision has worsened even further since last week. Perhaps I need\nanother type of steroid drop. Everything's  blurry -- and I'm extremely worried. I can't\nmake out the score in the basketball game on my large t.v. screen. I must put my face\nnearly up to my large computer screen to type. I will try not to drive for the near future\nunless completely necessary. I will see Dr. Marcovich, the ophthalmologist, h on Monday\nand impress upon him that I'm fighting for my life here and need him to be on board\n100%; I'll also contact Dr. Patel and explain what's going on so we can determine\nwhether or not I'll receive my third infusion on Friday, and at what dosage. I'll ask Dr. P's\nnurse to send Dr. Marcovich (again) the info sheet about Elahere so that he can make\n*sure* to educate himself about this drug. I sorely wish I could go to the Wilmer Eye\nInstitute at Hopkins; perhaps I will if I do not get satisfaction here asap.  I don't mean to\nbe melodramatic, but will I need to choose between blindness and death? Obviously, it's\na depressing situation. I might need to have a 'guest blogger' (!) for one of my next\npostings if I don't see improvement in my vision soon.\n                    \n'Tis but a scratch' -ha.\nThankfully, I've had such a pleasant visit with Ben, as always (and with Sammi earlier\nthis week). He's been kind and attentive and helpful and loving in every way. Today we\nenjoyed breakfast pastries and coffee at the Cake Shop by Tati, followed by a trip to\nSammi's Greenhouse to purchase some begonias and thyme to pot, and finished off with\na visit to my favorite antiques store, where I bought a few pretty Limoges pieces in\ncobalt blue to adorn my table (when cooking becomes less challenging....). Tonight Ben's\ndad Michael invited us over for grilled hot dogs (a favorite of mine) and hamburgers. I'll\nbe sad to see Ben return to NY tomorrow but hopefully I'll see him before long. His dad is\ndriving him to pick up his rental car as I don't want to risk driving when I don't absolutely\nhave to. :(\nPhotos",

And I\u2019m thinking of you and sending you all\nsorts of good thoughts about your vision\u2014xoxooxxoxo\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, May 20, 2023  \nDear, dear, for the life of me I couldn\u2019t have imagined my Parisian-outfitted friend, trout\nfishing in a PA creek! Amazing. Heartwarming to see you enjoy the experience to such\nan extent.\nOn the worrisome eyesight situation, why not make an appointment at the Wilmer Eye\n                    \nInstitute without waiting for possible local results? Gros bisous, big hugs - M\n  \u2014Monique Yaari, May 20, 2023  \nOh Willa that picture with you and your fish made me feel positively giddy!! Amazing.\nSo concerning about your vision \u2026 hope so much you can find help find a solution. Hugs\nand love to you, Janet\n  \u2014Janet Horne, May 20, 2023  \nHow \"Willa\" to begin with an enchanting bucket list narrative complete with painterly\nreminiscences (all of which took most of the space on this journal entry)! A gift to her\ncaring readership.\nSegueing, inevitably, however, into the very troubling medical update most of us must\nhave been fearing - indeed, even before the first visual symptoms appeared (but\ndreaded ever since hearing of their possibility as a side effect of Elawere).\nI'm deeply sorry for this development and hope there are missing possibilities about the\ncorneal story - for instance, that it may be temporary - g-dwilling. I read that sometimes\nsuch corneal effects can resolve in other situations. Perhaps the Elawere infusions and\nocular effects will be \"only for the time being\". Perhaps...\nMy current prayer therefore is for the Elawere to kick in and do its job for which you\ndared its ill effects (specifically, to kick the cancer in the butt!) allowing you to\ndiscontinue it and for your corneas to heal.\nThe nonchalance with which you recount this symptom's worsening while somehow\n(again!) narrating another beautiful experience, astonishes me. Another life lesson for\nme.\nOne among others making me think, \"well, if the incredible Willa can come this far,\nbearing such discomforts, while still seizing so much joy (and even catching one lovely\nspeckled trout her very first time fly-fishing), I don't rule out ANYTHING (for the better)!\"\nGO WILLA!\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, May 20, 2023  \nWhat a lovely, evocative description of your first experience fly-fishing! You definitely\n'got in the zone' that fisherfolk enjoy. I'm still hoping that the eye issue will\nimprove/resolve before long, perhaps with a lower dose of Elahere or Dr. Markovich's\n                    \nexpertise. Consulting at the Wilmer Eye Institute is a great fallback option. Love and\nhugs, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, May 21, 2023  \nOccasional fishing was one of the few activities my older brother and I shared as kids.\nGlad you were not only able to get to that bucket list item, but that you enjoyed catching\nyour own trout. I hope you can keep your vision a while longer. Hugs from Baltimore,\nhon!\n  \u2014David Miranda, May 21, 2023  \nFly fishing!!! You go girl \u2764\ufe0f. I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin.

Take care!!\n  \u2014Rebecca Bressler, May 21, 2023  \nI absolutely LOVE that you went on a fishing adventure! It looks like a beautiful day for it,\nand your beaming smile says it all. Uplifting photos and descriptions, and a perfect\nmother & son outing too. I echo your other friends' concerns about your vision and can\nsay that we had a very positive experience at Wilmer some years back for Sophie's\nvision issues. I'll be thinking about you as always and hoping your vision is stabilized and\ngoes back to normal. xoxo\n  \u2014Melissa Beattie Moss, May 21, 2023  \nWhat a wonderful fishing adventure and pictures! I tried fly fishing once and caught\nnothing (ha!) but you\u2019re right in your description of the movement and place having a\ncalming effect. Wishing you positive and productive communication between your\nophthalmologist and Patel. Sending \u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014Diana Gonzalez, May 21, 2023  \nNeed a ride to Baltimore? Always happy to drive, Willa!\n  \u2014Lisa Sternlieb, May 21, 2023  \nthat fishing story was great and made me want to try it someday! Perhaps an add to my\nown bucket list. Hope you get some better guidance/ luck with your vision soon.\n                    \n  \u2014Kory Olson, May 21, 2023  \nThe comments are as uplifting as your smiling photos and wonderfully warm descriptions\nof \"such a pleasant visit!\" I bet you reread everything over and over again in order to\nseal the happy memories into eternity! Maybe next time you'll mention the grilled hot\ndogs with Michael. Goodness, happiness, human capacities once again far outway the\nevil that besets us! XoXo\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, May 21, 2023  \nI was of course thinking of A River Runs Through It, which I read two years ago when we\nwere hiking near Bozeman. Every scene in the movie looked like a painting, and the\ncinematographer won an Oscar (1993).\nAs usual, thank you for such beautiful writing. I was there with you.\n  \u2014Jim Davis, May 21, 2023  \nI was not raised to go fly fishing.\nOh, I was tempted - Wyoming, mountains in the distance, perfect blue skies, rushing\nstream, enthusiastic friend/experienced fisherman. What wasn\u2019t to like?!?\nQuite a bit actually. Damn fly kept getting caught in rocks. Endless tying, re-tying. Not a\nnibble. The fish knew. And weren\u2019t about to give \u201cit\u201d up to some New York City kid, who\noozed \u201csubway\u201d and \u201clandlord-tenant court\u201d. A humiliation they knew to avoid.\nBut I\u2019m glad you dug it!\nPlease take care and I\u2019m hoping your eye situation resolves. positively, sending big love.\nB\n  \u2014Bryan Lurie, May 21, 2023  \nVous lire ma ch\u00e8re Wilma est un vrai d\u00e9lice : vous \u00e9crivez si bien et parvenez \u00e0 nous\nfaire vivre cette exp\u00e9rience de p\u00eache \u00e0 la mouche !

Best\nthoughts for the eye doctor visit.\n                    \n  \u2014Christopher Walker, May 22, 2023  \nBetter than going rogue, I suppose!\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, May 22, 2023  \nThese are great pictures, and it makes me happy to see you out fishing! On the vision\nissue, I hope you're seeing some improvement or abatement of the symptoms. I wanted\nto mention, though, that the iPhone has some wonderful accessibility features that might\nbe helpful, like audio descriptions and a Voice Over screen reader. Please get in touch if\nyou want any help accessing them or talking about them. I hope you had a good visit\nwith the eye doctor today. Sending love, Nancy\n  \u2014Nancy Locke, May 22, 2023  \nI hope you get good help and the vision improves soon! In the meantime\u2026I really enjoy\nlistening to books on my Libby app. It connects to your local library, and you can\ndownload ebooks and audiobooks. Xo Mark\n  \u2014Mark Feinberg, May 23, 2023  \nThanks for the suggestion, Mark. I really enjoy the act of reading (which I'm able to\ndo now only with my face smushed up against my Kindle....), but audiobooks may be the\nway to go at present. I don't know Libby but will look into it. Thank you! xo\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, May 26, 2023  \nWhile fly fishing would never be on my bucket list, so pleased that you got to do it with\nBen.

    "entry": "I'll try to blog instead of vlog here, as at the moment I'm able to see the  lettering on the\nscreen from about 1.5 ft. away. To update everyone and proceeding in reverse order:\nTomorrow I am going to Hopkins for an appointment with Dr. Oliver Schein, one of the\n'big guns' (I guess) at the Wilmer Eye Institute. I'm very much hoping he will have a\nconcrete suggestion for my still extremely blurry vision and/or will help me understand\nto what this problem is due. I am still seeing Dr. Marcovitch in State College but felt that\nI definitely needed input from a (cornea) specialist who may have some experience\nseeing Elahere patients. And I simply can't continue in such a radically compromised\nstate!\nSo back to Charm City tomorrow, hon. My appointment's at 1:30 to enable a roundtrip in\none day. I'm using a driver Michael and Sue suggested, who sounded quite nice on the\nphone. She'll pick me up at 8:45 at my house and will drive us to Hopkins in my car. My\nfriend Sandy also very kindly offered to take me, and it's always a bit of a (fun)\nadventure when we make the trip together, but I don't want to impose on my friends all\nthe time. I may need to rely on them again! I would love to see my Baltimore friends and\nfamily tomorrow but will be short on time, unfortunately.\nThis past Friday I received my third dose of Elahere (reduced by 15% because of the\nocular toxicity I've experienced) + a two-hour magnesium infusion. Dr. Patel suggested\nwe \"take the risk\" when I met with him last Thursday. What annoyed me was that he had\nnot read any notes from Dr. Marcovitch, which I had taken pains to have sent to Dr.\nPatel, so Dr. P. had to rely on *my summary* of my visit with Dr. Marcovitch to make this\nimportant decision about my chemo! Seemed pretty lame to me to rely on this\n                    \n'laywoman's' account (and convinced me further that Hopkins was the ticket...).\nSubsequently, I found out that Drs. Patel and Marcovitch spoke about my case on the\nphone, which put my mind at ease as at least one doctor previously seemed resistant to\nmaking the necessary effort to work as a team. And I need a team!\nChemo was rough this week. I experienced no other side effects other than fatigue (and\nthe lingering vision issues) but the exhaustion was a doozy. I slept most of Saturday and\nSunday (of course while kicking myself that I 'should' be doing something 'productive').\nSaturday morning I was able only to pick up some fresh strawberries (I can drive within a\nmile's radius when needed) and Sunday evening I watched the basketball playoffs (with\nmy face practically smushed against the t.v.).\nW I had had a third appointment with Dr. Marcovitch. He said my corneas actually looked\nmuch better (which opened the door for me to receive chemo two days later). But then\nwhy is my vision still so compromised? He couldn't really pronounce on that question: it\nmight be a rapid worsening of my cataracts (which need to be operated on); it might be\na rapid worsening of my vision due to factors other than corneal damage. How these\nthree factors may or may not be working together or separately is unclear to me (and, I\nthink, to him). He said he could probably give me a new prescription, but it's likely to\nchange again. At this point, I'm pretty desperate to have my vision improve even\nsomewhat. So perhaps it's merely a matter of needing a new prescription after a drastic\nchange in vision. Hopefully tomorrow's appointment will help clarify (no pun intended!)\nthe situation.\nI felt much less alone having two lovely friends accompany me to my appointments last\nweek: my friend John O., who took me to Dr. Patel's (I treated him afterwards to\ncoffee/tea in the garden of Caf\u00e9 Lemont), and my friend Lisa S., who came with me to Dr.\nMarcovitch's (aka 'the prune') and then to lunch at a tasty local taco place. And my great\ncombo of Janis and Jackie provided chemo rides this past Friday. All this helped me feel\nless isolated, as the dimming of my vision + the exhaustion from chemo were conspiring\nto make me feel as if I were sequestered in a black hole.\nI'll have a CT scan on June 20th. This will produce the most conclusive evidence about\nwhether Elahere is working (ie stabilizing or reducing my tumor size/cancer load) and\nthus whether I will continue treatment with this drug. As far as I know there is no plan B\n(more like plan 'P' at this point...) but I'm putting that out of my mind for now.\nToday I met via vidchat with a psychosocial oncologist to see what she might bring to the\ntable. My palliative care doctor suggested I might meet with her, as she's now part of the\nGeisinger oncology team. I might try another session or two with her; I'm not positive I'll\npursue further. It wasn't unhelpful but perhaps a bit 'formulaic.' There is some sort of\nworkbook I'd need to complete based on my reading of Viktor Frankl's _Man's  Search for\nMeaning_ (a book on my 'to read' list in any case). I'm not unconvinced that my long-\n                    \ntime therapist, although not specialized in oncology patients, doesn't provide enough\ninsight into my situation to be helpful (and she's super-smart). I do have curiosity,\nhowever, about some of the concepts mentioned by Dr. Perez, such as that of \"radical\nacceptance.\" At this point, though, I'm not sure I need more psychotherapy to muddle\nthrough facing a terminal illness, as opposed to reading more philosophy, religion etc.\nWe'll see.\nWas delighted that Ben and Sammi were invited to Shabbos dinner in Crown Heights\nwith his (second) cousins Zev and Yosef (two of the sons of my first cousin, David) and\nhis lively (second) cousin from New Zealand, Gresham (son of David's sister, Janie). A\ngood time was had by all, apparently. The next generation after mine and my cousins'\n(and brother's) is coming together in a beautiful 'rainbow coalition\" (of degrees of faith,\nnationality, profession etc.) and I feel that (we're) all is in good hands. This makes me\nhappy!",

Something of a failed experiment\non two counts as a)the soothing voice of the reader of Michael Chabon's _The Amazing\nAdventures..._ put me to sleep (!) and b)I had a very marked PTSD-type reaction to the\nintro to/techno-ish music accompanying the _NYTimes_ podcast, \"The Daily,\" which I\nused to listen to for hours on end about four years ago, immobilized on my chaise and in\npain after my big debulking surgery in 2019. I had no idea these few seconds would be\nsuch a trigger...\n*********\nBack from Hopkins on Tuesday, back from an appointment yesterday with Dr.\nMarcovitch. I was thanking some higher power this morning for the fact that two days\nago -- for the first time in about a month -- I could sense my sight improving. On the\ndrive down to Baltimore, the passing landscape appeared in much more vivid relief than\nbefore; the past two days my vision has been less blurred although by no means perfect.\nIt's still hard to make out fine detail. But I no longer feel the need to feel the space in\nfront of me to assess the safety of walking. And yesterday Dr. Marcovitch cleared me for\ndriving during the day! I drove about two miles to my dermatologist's office this morning\nand I felt confident doing so. However, I'm still accepting rides for longer drives and until\nI've made a fuller return to clear-sightedness.\nThe reason I can see better (but this seems actually part of a more complicated\ninteraction among corneas, cataracts, and compromised vision) is that, per Dr.\nMarcovitch, my left cornea is almost completely healed and my right one looks dry but is\ncoming along (>continue with artificial tears every few hours). Why my corneas have\nimproved while my vision appears radically worse is, again, complicated. It may be that\nthe irregularities on my corneas (assessed by a special machine at Hopkins that\nproduced a kind of topographical map of my corneas), while less notable than before,\nare positioned right at the center of the surface (ie the epithelium) of the cornea, where\nthey impact vision most dramatically.\nIndeed, my vision has become significantly worse as a result of this episode. *This* fact\nis not likely to change much. Obviously, this is a disappointment. I have a prescription for\nnew lenses but may only wind up with a left lens, as the decline is most dramatic in my\nleft eye (my right eye, in fact, has not changed that much). Because my vision is sort of\nin flux, it's possible I may need a new prescription before long.\nAs mentioned, what has improved are my corneas. The damage to this transparent layer,\n                    \nagain, is most apparent on their surface; the rest of the layer is intact. Both doctors\nconcur that my corneas should return to normal soon. \nHope that I'm not 'speaking out of school' here. Am trying to provide as clear yet\naccurate an explanation as I'm able of ocular issues whose vocabulary is foreign to me!\nThe trip to Hopkins and back, twelve hours in toto, was pretty exhausting for me, yet\nquite useful. Michael and Sue had connected me with an excellent driver based nearby\nwho also drives a Fullington bus. We took my car and reached Baltimore in about three\nhours, with about 45 mn to spare before my appointment. I found the Wilmer Eye\nInstitute, which I had passed many times during my previous trips to Hopkins. When I\nchecked in, the clerk assisting me stood up, walked over to a side desk and handed me a\nlarge, rectangular, flat white box. \"Oh great,\" I thought, \"some big pharma company is\nfoisting samples and pamphlets onto the Hopkins people, which they in turn are dumping\non us!\" Only on closer look, and to my absolute surprise, did I see a note in French\naffixed to the box, addressed to \"notre ch\u00e8re cousine,\" wishing me well with my\nappointment and hinting at some delicious treats inside to enjoy on the ride home (I\nhadn't eaten lunch and was famished). Indeed, nestled inside the box were an\nassortment of yummies that looked like they came straight from a French p\u00e2tisserie:\nlemon tart, macarons, croissant. My darling Baltimore cousins  -- \"les Aigles\" (the Eagle\nfamily) had gotten wind of my appointment (likely from this blog?), know all about my\nFrancophilia of course, and had shopped for me at a kosher boulangerie. This remarkably\nthoughtful gesture in the midst of a stressful day lifted me up and reminded me of the\nmiraculous moments of human connection that can make a twelve-hour schlep to\nBaltimore and back worthwhile! Truly the highlight of my day. [In my previous post, I\nwrote about how Ben and Sammi recently experienced more 'cousin love' in Brooklyn\nwith two of these Baltimore-born sons of my cousins David and Yehudis, Zev and Yosef].\nI spent about 1.5 hours being examined by Dr. Oliver Schein, his fellow (Dr. Adam\nsomething), and their assistant, who performed a battery of preliminary tests on me. The\nteam was very thorough, testing my eyes in various ways with seemingly more up to\ndate equipment than at Dr. Marcovitch's office and, as mentioned, photographing my\ncorneas.\nDr. Schein seemed personable and kind (his fellow actually spent longer with me than he\ndid). Based on his experience of observing how other chemo drugs (but not Elahere...)\ncan affect vision, he reiterated to me that the intense blurriness I was experiencing\nwould dissipate and my corneas would heal, but that this could take one-two months\ntotal (I had been seduced into anticipating a much shorter timeline based on accounts by\na few women in my Elahere chat room -- a small sample, to be sure). He provided me\nwith a new prescription. He asked to see notes from my baseline eye exam on Jan. 4 with\nDr. Nelson in State College, from just before I was to start receiving treatment with\nElahere. And he asked his fellow to proceed with a basic measure that Dr. Marcovitch\n                    \nhad seemed resistant to using: inserting eye plugs. Small silicone plugs are placed in the\ntop and bottom tear ducts; consequently, one's tears do not drain but instead remain on\nthe surface of the eye, 'irrigating' it with natural tears and providing continuous\nhydration that can benefit the eye. Dr. Adam X inserted these plugs for me (I hardly feel\nthem as they're tiny). I don't remember what else we discussed but Dr. Schein genuinely\nseemed kind and strongly disposed to help me. We didn't discuss a return visit but I'd\nlike to think that I could avail myself once again of the excellent care at Hopkins if/when\nneeded.\nThe last month's been a misery. Try to imagine, in as much detail as possible, what it\nwould mean for you to have your sight radically compromised. I know that people adjust\n('radical acceptance?'), yet I still feel much compassion for the legally blind living in a\n'sighted' world (I myself had passed into this realm about a week ago).\nAs for the million dollar question - will this cycle repeat after subsequent Elahere\ninfusions? - I don't know but somehow I tend to think not. And for another million dollars:\nwill I even be having another infusion of Elahere? The results of my CT-scan on June 20th\nwill tell. So now 'all' I have to worry about is the possibility of progression of my disease\ndespite treatment or discovery of new mets in my brain and/or elsewhere. LOL. I'll stick\nwith considering the next eleven days a reprieve -- and will bend with the bamboo.\nThings have skewed off kilter the past month in terms of any attempts I might make to\nformulate summer plans, goals (such as they are), even day to day objectives. I am\ntoying with the idea of trying to honor the trying emotions of the past month (and four+\nyears) in a non-judgmental way, which does not mean that I find them 'acceptable' for\nmyself (or anyone else, for that matter).\nSo much is out of our control. \n****\nOn the drive home, I asked Millie to swing by Alvaro's Bakery in Harrisburg, my usual pit\nstop between B'more or D.C. and State College, for a few more treats for both of us and\na dinner entr\u00e9e for me as I was way too exhausted to cook (indeed, I *needed*\nsomeone's Italian-American mama to cook up some lasagna and meatballs for me and\nAlvaro's happily obliged).\nLooking forward to a little country jaunt to buy flowers, herbs etc. tomorrow with my\nfriend John. Was at the farm market about a mile from my house this morning. The\nstrawberries this year are a wonder.",

He is that too uncommon (at least in\nmy experience) combination of a high level of both competence and kindness. Yes, he\ncertainly does care. I am impressed you had an 1 + 1/2 hour appt. there. Unluckily (from\nnow on I am careful to read patient reviews - his were terrible), the retinologist I saw\nthere spoke to me for only five minutes (really!) after an image analysis shared only with\nhis pretty young trainee, in a private conversation. GRRR.\nMost of all, I am absolutely thrilled to hear the confident prognosis of a corneal recovery\nand that your vision is already improved enough to allow for cautious driving.

    "entry": "Last weekend was fairly miserable. I don't think I realized how tired I was, mentally and\nphysically, from the quick round-trip to Hopkins. I still wasn't seeing well. I think I slept\nmost of the weekend, besides taking a drive on Saturday and attending an event Friday\nnight (about which more further on). My body was craving sleep (and actually still does,\noften). My sides/pleura shading into my back, abdomen, and stomach all ached, as if I\nhad a band of pain girding the middle section of my body. The pain tired me further.\nOxycodone helped (my palliative care dr. said I could even increase my dose by 50%,\nalthough I'm still trying to not take more than two pills a day). I had to cancel three\nsocial engagements and missed the second annual Pride parade in town, a welcome\naddition to State College's 'culture' and vibe, which of course made me sad. Dark\nthoughts were getting the better of me. I was convinced the pain was a harbinger of\nimminent death. Somehow I managed to not spiral down completely, reminding myself\nof the simple fact that, at least for now, there are good and bad days.\nThis week has been better. I still need a good amount of sleep (but am sleeping\nerratically), but my pain has decreased while my energy has increased. And my vision is\nimproving! This means I can drive, cook, write, watch t.v., read etc. - an enormous step\nforward. I tried to get my new prescription for lenses filled today but I botched the\nmission (for reasons too complicated and uninteresting to explain) so I will hopefully take\ncare of that on Monday, the day I also have an eye doctor appointment here. What else?\nI had appointments with my therapist and my palliative care doc, both stalwart pillars of\nmy medical/care team.\nNext Tuesday afternoon I'll have a CT-scan to determine whether Elahere is working,\nwhether my disease has progressed, remained stable, or even regressed. I am trying not\nto think about the scan until Monday, not to generate anxiety that may or may not be\nwarranted. There's no Plan B that I know of; at this point, we're sort of winging it,\nrelieved that a new drug came along in time for my doctors to add it to the treatment\nplan. The thought that I *might* need to stop treatment, if Elahere's not helping, while\nstill feeling relatively ok overall is certainly sobering.\nThis week was another one in which I felt rather 'unmoored,' as if the ground was shifting\nunder my feet. Plans get cancelled. A scan looms. My vision improves but remains iffy.\nFatigue weighs on me sometimes. Friends leave town on vacation, coming and going. I\n*did* try to get a grip by arranging a July vacation for myself, Ben and Sammi, in a place\nI love. Something to look forward to! I won't say more for now so as not to jinx these\nplans. But I hope they'll help me plant my feet on terra firma after several weeks of\nfeeling adrift.\nLast Friday night, despite not feeling 100%, I attended a Pride-themed service at our\nsynagogue, the first in my memory. My wonderful chemo nurse, Brianne, had expressed\n                    \nan interest in going (her Lutheran pastor had apparently announced it to his\ncongregation), along with her wife, Natalie, and charming daughter, Kaylen. The service\nfeatured specially selected, Pride-themed readings. I was gratified for the large turnout\n(including many people I didn't know, who also wished to attend such a purposefully\ninclusive service). Coincidentally, Brianne and Natalie (and Kaylen) knew a number of\npeople there from school, work, and other circles. It feels so important to show up for\none another (and not just at events 'designated' for this...). I may try to put this belief\ninto practice again tomorrow if/when I check out the town's Juneteenth goings-on.\nOf course, I'm in farmers market heaven right now. I realize that I much prefer summer\nto winter cooking because of the abundant 'farm to table' possibilities. Now that I can\nsee better, my cooking mojo has returned; this week I made a beet salad with goat\ncheese and pecans; warm German potato salad (had a craving, but I think it's too heavy\na dish for me) and garlic scape pesto (packs a garlicy punch - oh my!). I'm also intensely\ninto iced teas right now and am experimenting with different varieties. Plan to start\ncooking for others soon, too. \nA restful sabbath to all. \nPhotos",
    "comments": "Here is to decreased pain, restoring sleep, farmers' market joy, heart-warming cooking,\nand positive thoughts this w/e.

Fingers crossed for the CT scan.\n  \u2014Philip Mosley, June 17, 2023  \nso happy to hear your vision is improving! Good luck this week with your scan. I will be\nthinking of you\n  \u2014Kory Olson, June 17, 2023  \nEveryone has expressed my thoughts - about all the good things going on (including your\nability to find and share them, and so beautifully), while telling it like it is about the pain,\nphysical and psychological. All the uncertainty!\nI've been numbering the days from when you shared with us the date of your next MRI,\nchecking what the Elahere has accomplished. May the news be very good! It's approved\nbecause it IS a promising new medicine for your affliction, and if it succeeds with some,\nwell, why not you?\nIt comes with lots of thorns, but if it can beat back your enemy it will all be worth it.\nAnd we'll get to enjoy your generosity in sharing your journey\nand wisdom all the longer.\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, June 17, 2023  \nSending loving thoughts your way for the upcoming scan. But also thanking you for all\nthe beauty that you remind us of\u2026. Pride day, potted flowers, cooking, and your\nimproved sight to soak it all in. Xo\n  \u2014Diana Gonzalez, June 18, 2023  \nDear Willa, thinking of you always in these June days--so grateful your vision is improving\nand that you feel like cooking again.

    "entry": "The radiologists' report on my last scan, which I read Wednesday, reveals a significant\nprogression of my disease, so much so that Dr. Patel admitted to me when I saw him on\nThursday that he felt apprehensive about speaking with me that day. It turned out I\nmade his task much easier by being what he termed 'practical' - a word seldom if ever\napplied to me! - but by which I think he meant some combination of realistic and\ngraceful (ie full of grace).\nAlways hard for me to parse the medical language but Dr. Patel helped: increase in the\nsize of several lymph nodes, at least one in the thoracic area; increase in size of spots on\nliver; increase in size of at least one tumor at base of abdomen. These areas are not\nnecessary painful for me (although the abdominal tumor causes discomfort); instead, for\nsome reason, my back and 'flanks' ache *a lot* (a heating pad helps, as does\nOxycodone, which I'm relying on a bit more now). This might simply be from arthritis or\nelse from cancer in the pleura (membrane lining the thorax and coating the lungs);\n                    \ncancer is there.\nI asked Dr. P. if it is common for cancer to accelerate in this way, as this is certainly the\n'worst' scan report I've seen throughout my illness. He (re) explained that after so many\nlines of chemo being thrown at them, as had been my case, the cancer cells have\nbecome expert at mutating and otherwise figuring out how to elude the drugs targeting\nthem. The cancer cells create their own environment within my body, complete with\nblood supply and everything else they need to do their deadly deeds. Insidious, indeed.\nOr maybe the worst 'tenants' ever, the ones who take over and trash your beautiful\nhome, causing permanent damage beyond repair.\nI am certain that the doctors and other medical personnel reading this are not\nnecessarily surprised to learn of this progression, nor are a few friends who have lost\npartners to cancer. I myself was not surprised, while still retaining a glimmer of hope due\nto the promise of a newly-approved drug (I am detecting mixed results among women\ncurrently on Elahere).\nThe 'good' news (!) in all this is the absence of fluid build-up, for example in my lungs.\nIronically, my magnesium level is back in normal range for the first time in a long while,\nwhich mean no magnesium infusion yesterday. Obviously, we're discontinuing Elahere as\nwell. Both Dr. Patel and a fellow who was shadowing him on Thursday remarked on how\nwell I look; my by now legendary (lol) positive attitude tempered with realism impressed\nher. It's got to have helped some but sadly is not sufficient to beat back those cancer\ncells.\nBack on the rollercoaster, part XXX?: Yesterday, Dr. Beavis emailed me to say she had\nseen the scans (her own radiologists produced a report on them also), to express regret\nat what they show, and to offer to talk about potential next steps (??) and/or possibility\nof clinical trials at Hopkins. The challenge here will be logistical; she'll be on vacation July\n2-11. We can meet virtually, but I'll need to drive to MD as she can't practice across\nstate lines. And I'm scheduled to be away July 7-12. I'll wait until Monday to see what she\ncan offer.\nI of course want to hear what she has to say. And in the name of 'due diligence,' I'll likely\ncall/write MSK and see if they have anything to offer. I may look into alternative\ntreatments too. But quality of life is my overriding concern; given my relative dearth of\nenergy these days and the pain I'm currently dealing with, I'm adamant about using my\ntime/energy for activities and people that/who give me pleasure.\nIt's a strange time. Lots of emotions. I really don't know what I should be doing, thinking,\nfeeling. Still trying to throw out as much junk, old papers etc. as possible and get\norganized. But it's really been the same old existential question all along, per the title of\nthe Gauguin painting: \"Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?\"\n                    \nBen will be coming from NY over July 4th weekend. Of course, I can't wait to see him.\nHaving him here makes me feel so much better. If my health holds (and Dr. Patel felt it\nwill, as the vacay is coming right up), Ben and I will take off from here by car on July 7th,\nstaying overnight at a midway point of Fishkill, NY. The next day we'll pick up Sammi at a\ntrain station along our route and head to the magnificent Chatham Bars Hotel on the\nCape for a few days of sun, beach, oysters, lobster rolls (although I don't have much of\nan appetite!) and relaxing. I am unsure whether I'll return via NY or if we'll devise\nanother plan.\nLocal friends (or even those w/in driving distance!): if you feel inclined to pay me a\nshortish visit, I would love that! We can sit in the sun room or outdoors and have some\niced tea, maybe even trade a few memories. No need to feel obligated, though.\nUnfortunately, I'm currently not really able to run around as is my preference, but I'm\nstill likely up for lunch or iced tea out (or a cocktail - why not!), a drive in the country etc.\nEnjoyed dinner with my friends John and Kathryn at the Hublersburg Inn a few nights\nago. And having a summery dinner w/friends tonight - very much looking forward.\n*I know that for the very great majority of those reading this, it's unnecessary for me to\nwrite this, but please respect my privacy and do not share any of the above info via\nother social media.\n*Please feel free to DM or text me if the paratextual commentary seems too fraught in\nthis instance.",

    "entry": "Here are the latest developments:\nAfter much back and forth that only resolved yesterday, I was able to schedule a video\nappointment with Dr. Beavis for tomorrow at 11:00. She's extremely busy as she's\nleaving for vacation on the 2nd for ten days and all sorts of 'extras' (surgeries, meetings\netc.) have been crammed into her schedule; I am praying that she won't be 2.5 hours\nlate for our appointment, as she was last December. As all her appointments are via\nvideo on Fridays, I once again have to *cross state lines into Maryland* to meet virtually\nwith her, as she can't practice across state lines (this stricture was eased during Covid\nbut is back in place now). The last time I had to make this scenario work, I drove to a\n                    \ndinky hotel in Hagerstown and stayed overnight. This time, I've hired a driver -- I've\nnever met her before but she works with the wonderful Millie, who drove me to the\nWilmer Eye Institute at Hopkins not long ago -- and rented office space in Hagerstown.\nRenting co-working/workshare spaces is now a 'thing,' but as I've never availed myself of\nsuch a space it proved a bit complicated. My first reservation was denied: no more place\nat the space. With the intervention of a nice guy at central reservations (Salt Lake City,\nUT) for the \"Davinci Rooms,\" I was able to reserve an office at another workshare place\nin Hagerstown. Obviously this all took more time and energy than I hoped to expend and\nI just hope it works out. Holiday traffic? Construction? Bend with the bamboo.\nMy hunch is that Dr. Beavis will be performing \"due diligence\" with me (as she should)\ntomorrow, rather than producing some sort of trump card or miracle cure. We've agreed\nthat I'm at a 'critical juncture.' I certainly want to hear what she has to say, and have a\nnumber of questions for her, but I'm keeping my expectations low. This being said, I\nusually come away from meetings with her feeling more at peace than usual with my\nsituation.\nI also wrote to Dr. Cohen at Sloan-Kettering, sending him the latest radiologists' report\non my CT-scan and inquiring whether MSK might have something to offer me. His nurse\nreplied that in order for Dr. Cohen to fully assess the possibilities, I need to send him all\nmy medical records (oncologist's notes, CT-scans and MRI reports etc.) dating from my\nlast visit to MSK, sometime last year. Another daunting task for sure, but I imagine I'll\nsend him the stuff he wants (project for the holiday weekend?). Last year I was ineligible\nfor any clinical trials at MSK because I had had too many lines of chemo; MSK apparently\nhas very strict requirements for admission to their clinical trials, so that they can ensure\na very uniform cohort of participants. Perhaps, though, something new has come along\nthere since last year. Worth a try.\nI'm really not sure what else is worth a try at this point.\nI wondered out loud to my therapist recently why I wasn't more utterly devastated by\nregret and more wracked/wrecked by a sense of grotesque unfairness at this point,\nabout my career for example: all was on the up and up, with the prospect of another\nbook, prestigious invited lectures and visiting fellowships in the States and abroad,\ninteresting collaborations, museum work etc. all on the horizon. Or about the fact that I\nmay not get back to Paris, where I had a life or sorts (cue Meryl Streep, intoning with\nwistful melancholy: \"I had a farm in Africa...\"). My therapist conjectured that the fact that\nI'm 'holding steady' (more or less; I have my moments, believe me) may relate to my\nalready having done much processing of these misfortunes. I certainly allowed anguish\nto course through me (and out of me?) when I retired, so clearly was my work central to\nmy identity. The work of 'processing' has consumed at least part of every day of the past\nfour+ years for me. If this is indeed the case, if I've on some level at least 'come to\nterms' with my awful situation (which is not to say I accept it, but I understand it to be\n                    \nthe result of a terrible disease), then yay therapy. I'm grateful that the hard work has\nbeen so productive.\nRegret regarding *people* is another matter, which perhaps I'll be able to write about at\nsome point.\nNo real plans for the holiday weekend; it kind of crept up on me. Ben will be here on\nSunday, and that's of course the biggest treat. Perhaps Michael and Sue will invite me\nover for a grilled hot dog (hint?), mouthwatering goodness.\nI was so happy that several local friends liked my 'iced tea and chat in the sunroom'\nidea. Visits from Kathryn and Maria, and a delivery of delicious chicken soup from\nMonique, brought much cheer this week, and I look forward to seeing my friend Helen\nlater.\nAgain, apologies for delayed emails and texts. I'm sometimes in a lot of discomfort\n(back/sides) and can't do much more than crash on the couch.",

    "entry": "Friday I traveled round-trip to Hagerstown, MD, so I could have a video visit with Dr.\nBeavis. It's about 2.5 hours each way. My driver, Della, was very competent (former\nFullington bus driver) and got us there and back safely and in good time. I had about 45\nmn to get set up in an office at 5, Public Square, where a nice young women named\nCaroline was waiting for me (someone really should write a murder mystery transpiring\nwithin a network of these co-working spaces!).\n                    \nDr. Beavis was only about 10 mn late logging on. We spent about 35 mn together before\nshe had to go perform a surgery. She's always quite clear and methodical in her\nexplanations. She presented what she feels are the three options available to me at this\npoint, with my cancer so advanced:\na)clinical trials, but only if they seem exceptionally promising. In my experience, I must\nadd, my brain mets have always been a deal breaker for cancer centers that are set on\ncomparing 'apples to apples' to achieve optimal results. Brain mets are a potentially\nconfounding factor. I am hoping to hear from MSK soon (they did contact me about\ngetting my records) and Dr. B. had not yet reached out to the trials team at Hopkins. The\nthought of perhaps regular travel at this point to NYC or Baltimore is really quite\ndaunting to me. I don't have much stamina. And for the record, being based in my cozy,\npeaceful home in SC, surrounded by friends here, with easy access to my medical team,\nis really preferable to me as opposed basing myself in NY (where?). Still, I'll find out more\nabout this option.\nb)taking one of two oral chemo meds and seeing if they might work. Success rate (this\nwould be my seventh line of chemo, with the success rate -- ie stabilizing or reducing of\ncancer load -- diminishing with each line): 10-15%\nc)Stopping treatment. No more poison in my body. I'd then be able to access home\nhospice care, stronger pain meds etc.\nI am not sure which option I'll pursue.\nI am so tired, mentally and physically.\nMy entire midsection hurts a lot. As Dr. B. explained, there's a lot going on there:\nenlarged lymph nodes near stomach, thorax; liver; pleura; slightly arthritic back; and lots\nof sensitive nerve endings. Heating pad helps as does Oxycodone. My sleep doesn't\nappear to be disrupted by the pain. I need a lot of rest as my body continues to fight the\ncancer inside me.\nDr. B. then went over three likely death scenarios (I had been meaning to ask her about\nthis). I think I'll skip the details, none of which are pleasant, and write simply that in each\nscenario a different organ would be the culprit: a)bowels/intestines; b)liver; c)brain. \nDeath will be gradual, accompanied by increased fatigue, general 'slowing down,'\nlessening of appetite etc.\nDr. B. said my disease has followed the course that she had anticipated from the\nbeginning.\n                    \nLooking at about six months.\nDr. Beavis and I agreed that this is all a terrible shame.\nIf I were you, I probably wouldn't know what to say, but you've proven me wrong before.\nFeel free to DM or text me if you wish. There is something that you can do that would\nmake me happy, but no obligation! Please share a specific memory of me from our\nrelationship with one another. It can be anything at all, just something that sticks out in\nyour mind. It would give me pleasure to read these. Again, you can DM, email or text me.\nAnd again, no obligation!\nBen is due to arrive very soon and I can't wait to see him. Michael is picking him up from\nthe train station in Lewistown. Somehow, I don't know how, I managed to do some\ncooking: a delicious Spanish tomato soup I first sampled at my friend John Ochoa's\nhouse; an apricot cobbler; beet salad. It's hard for me to cook these days. I lack energy\nbig time.\nWe'll be heading to Cape Cod on Friday, barring any unforeseen emergency.\nAt what point do I draw the veil over an experience that's feeling increasingly solitary? I\nguess when things start to feel as if they're becoming too personal to share and/or if I'm\nphysically unable.\nI'm not even checking this post for minor errors, just sending it as is. Thanks so much for\nall the texts, emails etc. of concern. I am needing to rebound from the past few days but\nwill try to be in touch, at least via CB.",

XO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, July 2, 2023  \n\u201cNap and cry time\u201d\u2026how did we arrive at this as our slumber-partying 12-year-old\nselves? My bedroom in Amherst. Trying to stay up all night. Midnight raids in search of\nOscar Meyer bologna and maybe Sarah Lee brownies if we were really lucky. The\nrevelation that maybe there was no beginning of time and therefore maybe there would\nbe no \u201cend.\u201d Your always aware, always present relation to time and memory\u2014regarding\nthe Universe, modern France, and your life. Uproarious laughter between the discovery\nof shared profundities. My desire to keep making you laugh so I could hear what I\u2019ve\nalways felt is your most joyous and surprising sound. Early morning light creeping\nthrough the blinds of my bedroom window. Sounds of the Amherst public works workers\nstarting their day as we could no longer resist sleep.\nNap and cry time, dear friend. But then maybe Paris? Impossible to imagine today, but\nmaybe possible to imagine some not too distant tomorrow? Thank you for the beautiful\nbirthday message. Amidst all, we remain Mrs. Willa and Mrs. Kay. Love you\u2014\n  \u2014Kay Young, July 2, 2023  \nMy dearest Willa,\nI am so sorry to hear your latest news. However, I am always inspired by your strength\nand courage. I hope that when I am looking at the end of the road, I can approach it with\nas much grace and dignity as you have.\nI really regret that we did not spend more time together when we were younger. not\ngetting to know you better when we were both Harvard undergraduates was a real\nshame.\nLove,\nClinton. \n  \u2014Clinton Collins, July 2, 2023  \nWilla, it\u2019s hard to choose just one memory because of the richness of all of them\u2014you\nbeing my post divorce life guru, going from sce to our reunion together and\nback\u2014hanging at the Starbucks on atherton and laughing \u2014giddily\u2014also toasting you at\nyour birthday at Zola\u2019s\u2014you have showed me how to celebrate\u2014also the book party that\n                    \nyou generously hosted for me at your beautiful house\u2014and most recently, at our multi\nhour breakfast at the Naked Egg\u2014food, joy, celebration, and deep friendship\u2014I treasure\nyou and send you a huge hug as you rest and welcome Ben and head to the\ncape\u2014xoxox\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, July 2, 2023  \nI recall when we reconnected: it was summertime maybe 2013 or2014 and you were\nliving in a summer rental in Cambridgeport. Somehow I knew you were coming (maybe I\nhave the year wrong), and I believe you were here for French research at Harvard. In any\ncase, we had a lovely dinner out in Harvard Square and I learned so much about your life\nin all the intervening years since we graduated! I recall being so charmed by you, by how\neasy our conversation over dinner, about your fascinating scholarship and your many\ntrips to Paris. Hearing about Ben got the first time. Sharing with you our story with\nsurrogacy and about Danya\u2026and how supportive you were. Afterward, I drove you back\nto the clapboard house where you were subletting. It was a wonderful summer evening,\nand it set us up to be on such easy terms when our 35th r\u00e9union came around. I\u2019m\nterrible with dates and numbers! As well you spoke about growing up in NYC, and we\nshared stories about our families and Judaism. I felt ,afterward, as if I had known you\nclosely for decades, and found that you are so warm and engaging. Also I recall thinking\nthat there is something that feels \u2018kin\u2019 just because we are both Reform Jews. In any\ncase, it\u2019s your amazing smile that sticks in my mind from that summer evening! \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nAndrew\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, July 2, 2023  \nThree images of you come immediately to mind, somehow overlapping despite the gap\nin years. In the first, we're at your apartment on a playdate -- before they were called\nplaydates. It's the first time I'm at your house, and you've just received a package, in\ncellophane, of new stamps and are sorting them for your (or Ethan's?) collection. I know\nabsolutely nothing about stamps, and you are incredibly happy -- and proud -- to explain\nthings to me. You have this confidence that isn't snooty, just cheerful. Second image:\nYou are striding up to the stage during Nightingale's honors assembly, circa 1977, to\nreceive the Edna Hill Robillard Scholarship. Again: you are confident and joyful, neither\nsmug nor falsely modest, even though it's a big f-ing deal. Third image: the two of us\ncross paths in Harvard Yard in winter, both of us a little embarrassed, perhaps, that\nwe've found our own friend groups and are going our separate ways. You smile your\nsmile--the same one I saw when we were eleven, when we were eighteen; the same one\nI've seen in every photograph you've posted here and elsewhere. In all of these\nmoments, you are steady and joyful, and somehow, though brilliant, never dark. I hope\nthat having the support of your friends on this site has been one of the ways you've kept\nthat light shining through this extraordinarily difficult journey. But I suspect that your\n                    \nstrength and the way you embrace life is just enviably part of who you are, who you've\nalways been, whether people are watching or not. For the times ahead, I wish you\nstrength, clarity, and above all the knowledge that you are loved.\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, July 2, 2023  \nHello, dear friend. Your account is so straightforward and factual. I\u2019m thinking about you\nall the time.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, July 2, 2023  \nHands down favorite memory: spilling a giant ice bucket on the table next to us at Pure\nCaf\u00e9 while asking a table of girls to take our picture!!\ufffd\ufffd\n  \u2014Heather McCoy, July 3, 2023  \nI have some awesome work memories: we first met when NFM and I invited you to speak\nat our \"salon\" and you gave a totally kick-butt performance in the NLI. And the time we\nserved as respondents to the \"Moments of Change\" panel - your summary was super\neloquent and you did it without a script. But I will talk about fun memories: Sitting with\nyou for dinner or just drinks at the Barrel 21 bar (we seem to always opt for the bar even\nif there is a table available, and somehow we'd always say we were meeting for a drink\nand we'd both end up ordering dinner). Often Eric Ian Farmer or another local musician\nwould be performing. Then we gab and gab and gab about the state of the world,\npolitics, work, families, code-named boys, Koko, pretty much *everything*, with a lot of\nlaughing. You are an amazing listener. XOXOXO\n  \u2014MARIA TRUGLIO, July 3, 2023  \nWe cherish our times with you in Amsterdam during the preparation of the Naturalism\nexhibition, and listening to you lecture at the Van Gogh Museum, and reading your book\non Vever. So many wonderful memories we don't want to forget. With love. Y and G\n  \u2014gabriel weisberg, July 3, 2023  \nI responded by text, my darling Willa \u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, July 3, 2023  \nI will DM.\n  \u2014Jim Davis, July 3, 2023  \n                    \nMy favorite memory would have to be the dinner we had at Le 6 Paul Bert with that\nincredible bottle of wine that reminded us of roses! Runner-up is getting to take the\nentire Weiss Seminar class to MoMA and getting badges to lecture in the galleries.\n  \u2014Nancy Locke, July 3, 2023  \nDo you recall our lunch at the Ale House? I think you know which one. Priceless. Mostly, I\nlove our conversations about family, food, travel, movies, work, sports, fashion,\nrelationships, and everything else we count as blessings in our lives.\n  \u2014H Miller, July 3, 2023  \noh dearest Willa, the giggles, the giggles.... !!! The stories are rushing back and I hope to\nshare some of them with you during a summer SC visit if you can stand it. So much love,\nIsabelle\n  \u2014Isabelle Genest, July 3, 2023  \nI am so sorry to hear this news. I am so happy that you will see your son soon, and will\nthink of you heading to Cape Cod together. xo Diana\n  \u2014Diana Gonzalez, July 3, 2023  \nWilla, these beautiful comments and memories are such a testament to the priority you\nplace on friendships and to your gift at nurturing and sustaining them. This ties into a\nmemory I cherish: You were the very first person who welcomed us and spoke with us\nwhen we attended services shortly after moving to State College in 2001. I will never\nforget how your radiant smile and upbeat attitude made me feel confident that our life\nthere could be a good one. I\u2019m hoping that your next update is one about some perfect\nglorious days on the Cape with your beloved son. Keeping you in my heart and here for\nyou if there is anything I can do to help you. Xoxo\n  \u2014Melissa Beattie Moss, July 4, 2023  \nThe memory that sticks is from college: We were in a dorm room and you read from a\nbook of French poetry\u2014in your element, enchanted and entranced.\n  \u2014David Miranda, July 4, 2023  \nA recent memory... actually, of Paris and Facetiming with you while you were just on the\nother side of the wall. Despite having to cut the trip short, I am so glad you had some\ntime in your 'happy' place and that we had that time together. Enjoy your visit with Ben.\n                    \n  \u2014Jill Gaines, July 4, 2023  \nSending warm thoughts your way\n  \u2014David Margolis, July 15, 2023  \nCh\u00e8re Willa, tous nos souvenirs tournent autour de \"Vever\" et je tenais \u00e0 vous dire que\nvous faites partie de ceux qui ont contribu\u00e9 au r\u00e9veil de \"la belle endormie\" : soyez en\nremerci\u00e9e.

    "entry": "It's been a minute. In the interim, Ben was here for a week, followed by my trip to the\nCape with Ben and Sammi and  return via NYC, where I spent the night at my mom's. I'll\nprobably report on that interlude in my next post, reserving this one for a health update.\nI've been showered with blessings in the form of emails, texts, even gifts from friends\nand family (maybe partly in reaction to the sobering account of my virtual visit with Dr.\nBeavis). I really want to respond to every one but it's taking a while. Here's why:\nActually, I'm sure it's not hard for you to imagine: the reality (mortality?) check from Dr.\nBeavis really shook me, and I'm doing what I can to get my bearings, whatever that can\nmean in this context. Related to this, of course, is the fact that I'm feeling generally\npoorly (nevertheless, she persisted...); more on this below, but I lack energy even for\nbasic tasks (walking to the mailbox, cooking). Also, in the past two weeks I've been\nblessed (yes, I'll use the word again) by conversations with several important people in\nmy life that have been exceedingly honest, raw, and, ultimately, *healing.* While these\nmoments of intensity have left me at peace, I also feel drained psychically from some\nattempts at, if not closure, then unfiltered soul connection. Thank goodness therapy\nprepared me for these encounters! In response to one of my postings, a while back my\nfriend David R. taught me the expression 'livin' large' as it pertains to some lifestyles in\nthe gorgeous wide-open spaces of the Colorado Rockies where he's made his home. I'm\n'livin' large' emotionally, and sometimes it tires me!\nSo today I spent nearly four hours in the infusion room getting pumped up with\nmagnesium and iron, then continued on to the ophthalmologist's. My magnesium level is\nagain low, as is, now, my hemoglobin count (>red blood cells, oxygen etc.). What's with\nthe iron problem? The day after we arrived on Cape Cod, ie last Sunday, I noticed to my\nconsternation that I was spotting, not heavily but enough to send me to CVS for\nabsorbent pads (is this tmi? I've lost nearly all shame regarding my bodily functions...). I\nwas further concerned as I'm obviously post-menopausal, yet the blood had to be\ncoming from somewhere. I sent Dr. Patel's nurse a message via the Geisinger portal, to\nwhich she responded with a phone call the next day. One or more of the tumors on my\n'vaginal cuff' is likely bleeding, not uncommon with ovarian cancer.  It feels like awful\nperiod cramps 24/7 (the irony is not lost on me as I had nearly all my 'hardware'\nremoved during debulking surgery). My pelvis aches. The bleeding also explains the low\nhemoglobin count and the acute fatigue, shortness of breath etc. while we were on the\nCape. So now I'm to have three more iron infusions after today's; the good news is that I\nseem to already feel perkier from this first dose! I'm grateful that Dr. Patel's office is\nmonitoring me closely.\nBasically, the middle third of my body -- chest, abdomen and pelvis -- causes me much\ndiscomfort, sometimes pain. Cancer in my pleura can make it hard to find a comfortable\nsleeping position (though I've been sleeping well - lots of dreams). Oxycodone every six\n                    \nhours helps relieve pain and I nearly always have a heating pad near me to alleviate\nback/pelvic discomfort. Long soaks in the jacuzzi at our hotel in Chatham also felt terrific.\nI've been giving much thought to how to treat my body as compassionately as possible.\nThis afternoon I had an appointment with my ophthalmologist, Dr. Marcovitch. I'm\npleased to report that, following a month of horribly blurry vision, a trip to a specialist at\nHopkins, steroid drops, and much aggravation, my corneas have healed completely. I\nmarvel at my body's ability to heal certain deficiencies while under siege from cancer. I\nalso have to go pick stronger lenses that I ordered, which should help further correct my\nnear-sightedness. I may well need cataract surgery (requiring at least 5-6 office visits)\nbut we're leaving that discussion open, because....well, because.\nI've had a mild headache or two recently, which of course makes me worry about my\nbrain.  While this organ has been 'cooperating' since my last go-around with radiation, in\nthe past new spots have emerged every few months or so. I'm waiting for Dr. Patel the\nyounger's office to call me (likely later this month) so we can schedule an MRI, once it's\nbeen approved by Highmark. We'll then proceed from there.\nI still haven't decided which of the three options Dr. Beavis presented to me I will go for:\nclinical trial (a longshot, imo); oral chemo drug with 10-15% chance of effectiveness (ie\nin terms of stabilizing or reducing cancer load); cessation of treatment. So for now I do\nnothing. Is this a de facto choice? Quality of life needs to guide my decision. Initially I felt\nthat stopping treatment was the 'easiest' choice because it requires no evident agency\n(e.g. taking a medication, travelling to a clinical trial site) but now I understand that it\nmay be the hardest option as it requires full acceptance of my situation.\nI am still eager for visitors. Lying on my couch in my sunroom warmed by my heating\npad and blissed out on  pain meds, I'm ready to dive into conversation and quality time\nw/friends and family. It takes my mind off cancer, that's for sure. My cherished friend\nHelen and I had a wonderful visit on Sunday. We laughed uproariously reminiscing about\nan improbable, slightly embarrassing situation we experienced together a few summers\nago; shed some tears; dished about work, family, life, travel and more. Thanks to my old\nschool pal Zia, I also met her friend and former NYTimes editor, Christopher Philipps, a\nnative New Yorker of E. European Jewish descent  like me, who was en route to spend\ntime in an Amish/Mennonite community in Ohio. How he met these folks is only one of\nthe stories we spun during a delightful. *And* as I've been blogging this evening I've also\nbeen texting with my grad school bffs Vinni and Isabelle, who plan to visit me in early\nAugust. I can't wait!\nMichael kindly brought me some of Sue's borscht earlier. I'm sure it's delicious and look\nforward to sampling it for dinner along with Peruvian chicken delivered by my friend John\nOchoa, a fabulous cook. On that note, I'm also exploring the possibility of having a local\nchef/caterer with an excellent reputation  make some of my meals going forward. Meal\n                    \nprep can tire me, even though I love  to cook.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "I had intended to report on our recent trip to the Cape. which I hope to do still, but write\nwith a cancer update instead. \nI'm about 99% decided on stopping treatment. Option 1 presented by Dr. Beavis, joining\na clinical trial, would involve travel that would undoubtedly sap whatever paltry energy\nreserves I could tap into at this point and would mean time away from friends, my cozy\nhome etc. Whether I'd even be admitted to a trial having had brain and liver mets is\nunlikely, but theoretically possible. I will share with Dr. Cohen at MSK the report on my\nnext brain scan, upcoming in early August, and he and Dr. Beavis will let me know what\nmight be available to me in term of trials at Hopkins and at MSK. Option 2, taking an oral\nchemo med daily with a 10-15% effectiveness rate, means putting more poison into my\nbody, returning to weekly blood work to ensure no drops in red and white blood cell\ncounts that could lead to infection, and other side effects etc. Of course, that 10-15% is\npresumably made up of *real people,* so why not me? But didn't Einstein define insanity\nas doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results? This would be my\n*seventh* line of chemo. By now, those cancer cells have made themselves nice and\ncomfy inside my body, have generated their own blood supplies and created a perfect\nenvironment in which to thrive. I think I'm done.\nI had to get past the feeling that Option 3 was somehow a cop-out because it involves no\n*action* on my part -- e.g. taking a pill, sending off reams of documents to hospitals\nsponsoring clinical trials, travel. Shortly I began to understand that rather than a passive,\ndefault choice, Option 3 is in fact the most difficult choice as it implies acceptance of my\nsituation. Yes, it is the antithesis of the 'leave no stone unturned' approach. Its goal is\nensuring quality of (remaining) life as opposed to (potential) quantity.\nThree of my doctors -- Patel, Perez (oncology therapist) and Vithalani (palliative care) --\nhave also promoted discontinuing treatment. While I listened closely to them, their\ninfluence was not decisive. Dr. Patel said he would support me if I wanted to try\ntreatment with an oral chemo. Dr. Beavis has left the decision to me. Everyone seems to\nthink, though, that all three options will have the final end result.\n*****************************\nUpdate within an update: So I just returned from the radiation oncologist's to discuss the\nbleeding that started on the Cape and the possibility of using radiation to stop it. I had\nbeen previously told merely that \"Dr. Patel (junior) wanted to talk this over with you\" so\nimagine my surprise when I was told to undress for a pelvic exam that Dr. Patel would\nperform. Since he's actually a very sweet, puppy-faced guy (really quite cute, but too\nyoung for me...), he quickly reassured me that he performs these all the time, that we\ncould stop if I were in pain etc. I didn't fully understand the need for the exam as I was to\nhave a CT scan of my pelvis right afterwards (also news to me when I showed up for my\nappointment) but I think the exam had to do with visualizing and feeling the source of\n                    \nthe bleeding. In any event, the exam was shorter and less invasive than one an ob-gyn\nwould perform. Dr. Patel's PA, Angie, an annoyingly cheerful central PA type who\nresponds to any question requiring an affirmative with a disconcertingly enthusiastic\n\"YEPPERS!,\" was also in the room. Dr. Patel could clearly feel a tumor that was the likely\nculprit. I then went next door in his office to have a CT-scan. Due to the pelvic exam, I\nstarted bleeding more heavily than before; lying on the hard surface for the CT-scan, my\nback was hurting a lot as the technician drew spots and crosses on my hips and pelvis\nwith a Sharpie. I was in tears from the pain, quite frankly. The upshot is, though, that Dr.\nPatel would like to treat my bleeding tumor with radiation. This will likely stop the\nbleeding and may shrink the tumor too. Left untreated, I will continue to bleed, risking a\ndrop in hemoglobin and anemia. My bladder may also become irritated or compressed.\nThis bleeding is not inconsequential.  Onward then to *fifteen* more rounds of radiation,\nsupplemented by iron infusions for two more weeks (had one this morning).\nThis means I must again reach out for help with rides. Dr. Patel wants me to take a\npainkiller before each round (I am now armed with morphine...) so I won't be so darned\nuncomfortable while it's happening. And I can't drive myself to radiation if I'm taking this\ntype of painkiller, as I'll be too woozy. Sooo..... I need fifteen rides divided among any\nnumber of people. Total time involved: 1-1 /2 hours max? This will involve picking me up\nat my place, driving me to the hospital, waiting while I undergo radiation (20 mn.), then\ndriving me home. . Most appointments are at 1:30 (with a few exceptions) over the next\nthree weeks (beginning this Thursday, actually). Thanks in advance for letting me know if\nyou might help me out with this. Uber can always be a default but frankly it's neither the\nmost convenient nor desirable option.\n***************************\nSunday I was visited by a case manager for UPMC hospice services, for which I'll be\neligible anytime after officially stopping treatment. Hospice is a form of care focused on\npreserving and extending quality of life for terminally ill patients. It's no longer our\n'grandparents' hospice,' an 'antechamber of death' where patients lived their final days\nin a morphine haze. The local team consists of a nurse (who would come to my house at\nleast once every two weeks), nurse's aide, volunteer(s), social worker and 'spiritual\nadvisor.' These folks could come over on an 'as needed and desired' basis for as long or\nshort a period as I'd like. Frankly, I could use all the help I can get, am eager to get relief\nfrom stronger pain meds as I'm often in much discomfort, and need to get my hands on\nsome medical devices such as a Life Alert; the hospice team can attend to all these\nneeds. Rabbi Ostrich happened to call me yesterday and we'll get together next week. I\nwould more likely lean on him more than on 'spiritual advisors' provided by UPMC\nhospice, none of whom are Jewish, although their training for this part of their job is non-\ndenominational (again, we're in rural central PA here, sigh...).  I would have loved to\nhave been visited by the wonderful Hopkins chaplain, Rhonda, a progressive Methodist\nminister, but she's obviously too far away.\nI'm thinking comfy, cozy, hygge, sunroom, visitors, peacefulness, iced tea... I feel like I\n                    \nshould be delving into profound works of literature (I did crack open Viktor Frankl's\n_Man's Search for Meaning_ the other day), but mainly I feel like relaxing on the sofa in\nmy sunroom and watching cooking shows! Speaking of which, Rebecca, a local private\nchef with an excellent reputation, will likely soon begin cooking for me two or three times\na week. I love to cook as always, but it can tire me out (at least now due to my blood\nloss/low hemoglobin/anemia issues).\nMy friends have been magnificent all along. Saturday night two of them hosted a potluck\nthat was sort of my idea at the outset but somehow morphed into being \"Willa's party!\"\nEverything about the evening was perfect: gorgeous summer night (not too hot, no\nhumidity), crescent moon, delicious food and drink, live music, a magical outdoor\nsetting, great company. I'm a lucky girl. My friends Maria, Jackie, and Kathryn have\nvisited, ditto yesterday my friend Esther, bearing the red lentil soup and blintzes (!) I\nasked if she would make for me. Dinner tonight at the Ale House with friends Cheryl,\nSandy, and Kathryn. At this point I can handle outings in moderation; I tend to get tired\nand uncomfortable after a while, although I rallied for four hours Saturday night's party.\nI've always loved a good party.\nPhotos",

You are amazing in that you live\nyour life to the fullest, my friend! I\u2019m in awe of how you\u2019ve handled all of the cancer\ntreatments and kept cooking and going on some mini trips and living your life. It\u2019s all any\nof us can do. But not all of us find the inner resources when faced with such scary\n\u2018roads\u2019. Keep on keeping on, Willa. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, July 25, 2023  \nThank you, dear friend. You always have just the right words!\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, July 25, 2023  \nliving life, love it. I would say that making the decision to stopping treatment is most\ncertainly an action, making a decision is taking action. I do get what you mean, of\ncourse, it might help to see it is as very much of an action. Just a thought. Thinking of\nyou. Love, Jessi\n  \u2014Jessica Karp, July 25, 2023  \nWilla, I\u2019m also in awe and so wish I could have been at the Willa party\u2014there in spirit and\nso admiring of you as always \u2014sending huge hugs xoxoxo\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, July 25, 2023  \nYou write: \"I feel like I should be...\", and I would suggest that this might be a good time\n(never too late, even for good girls) to search-and-replace the word \"should\" with \"want\"\nfrom as many of your thoughts as possible. That is, at this moment, maybe the only\nthing you *should* be doing is what you *want* to be doing, and if that is wearing your\ncoziest sweats and watching cooking shows while playing online Scrabble and listening\nto, I don't know, Barry Manilow, do it. Do what you want. Whoever is watching knows\nyour heart.\n  \u2014Lisa Grunwald, July 25, 2023  \nWilla, how not to weep with love and awe at such a message? Your writing is a testament\nto a loving life lived large. So many of our prayers in Judaism are blessings filled with\n                    \ngratitude. I am grateful to know you. You inspire me at this very moment.\n  \u2014David Rothman, July 25, 2023  \nAlthough I am your aunt, I am also your admirer. Your friends have said it well, for me.\nYou have given added strength to the command, \"Choose Life.\"\n  \u2014Marlene Green, July 25, 2023  \nHow can we not be encouraged by your gentle realism? May we follow your example in\ncaring for yourself and others, and in gratefulness for the best that life has offered,\ndespite your courageous efforts at confronting evil! I'd love to be one of your drivers, but\nI no longer have a car, it didn't pass inspection. XOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, July 25, 2023  \nI had to take a deep breath before reading this posting since a decision was expected\nsoon. And another deep breath after reading your decision. Relieved that you're at peace\nwith it (since you really did not leave any stone unturned), and I can only hope\neverything from now on will bring you multiple mini pleasures and comfort. I am signing\nup as driver and companion for your radiation over the next weeks, and I am so glad Dr.\nPatel Jr had a solution for the frightful bleeding! Big hugs to you -- M\n  \u2014Monique Yaari, July 25, 2023  \nWish I could have been there for the Willa party but this just means we will have another\none when I get back. You are a one of a kind. \u2665\ufe0f\n  \u2014Heather McCoy, July 26, 2023  \nI wish I lived closer so I could be one of your drivers, Willa! I am thinking about you all\nthe time. Your spirit is unsinkable, so party on, party girl\u2026there is much sacredness in\nthe everyday \u201cjust because\u201d celebrations that you inspire and create. And please do let\nyourself have each and every thing that gives you comfort and relief. Sending love.\n  \u2014Melissa Beattie Moss, July 26, 2023  \nI also wish I lived closer to be a driver. Comfy, cozy and peacefulness in the sunroom\nsounds beautiful. Sending love and support.\n  \u2014Jill Gaines, July 26, 2023  \nnot necessarily the update I wanted to read, but am so proud of you for making this\n                    \ntough decision and relieved you are at peace with it. Hoping the next steps keep you\ncomfortable and continuing to do what you love/ enjoy\n  \u2014Kory Olson, July 26, 2023  \nWilla, I've been following, and thinking of you, even though our connection may be\ndistant. I am sorry I'm about 6 states away and not able to be a driver either. I would just\nadd that while chemo might help about 10% of people, the wonderful people of hospice\nservice help about 99% of people. They will know how to help without asking, maybe\neven before you do. It is a proactive decision, go for it.\n  \u2014David Margolis, July 27, 2023  \n  \nJuly 30, 2023 - Cancercation #4",

    "entry": "I wanted to make sure to leave some written and visual traces of our trip to Chatham,\nwhere Ben and I vacationed three summers ago. This may be a bit of a 'telegraphic'\nreport, though, and punctuation is assuredly 'anarchic!'\nDrive with Ben with overnight stop in Fishkill, NY (Hudson Valley) w/take-out dinner from\nthe dazzling Red Line Diner (gleaming chrome - huge menu - bustling - display case\nboasting every type of pie imaginable) - Ben and I have some of our best talks on long\ncar trips - pick up Sammi the next day from the train station in Brewster, NY (had d\u00e9j\u00e0\nvus of all my comings and goings along that train line when I was in high school and\ncollege: to New Canaan to visit Julie, to Irvington to visit a friend, Gay,  whom I had met\non my France trip when I was sixteen; to Michael's parents' home in Hartsdale - same\nTudor-style architecture in the shops surrounding the station - same Westchester-ish\nvibe) - Sammi drives us to Chatham, on the 'elbow' of the Cape, listening to podcasts\n(David Chang; interview with Jake Tapper); thick haze that doesn't leave for two days -\ncan't see the ocean! Cooler temps and mist, not unpleasant; Chatham Bars Inn perfect in\nevery way (those lush sheets! those salt caramels and aged cheddar cheese and\ncrackers awaiting us! those thick, fluffy towels! that ultra-professional service poolside\nand everywhere else on the property! those hydrangeas and that gorgeous\nlandscaping!); first night dinner at The Impudent Oyster in town (cold, briny Wellfleet\noysters - I can never get enough of that unique taste sensation, but which goes better\nwith them, mignonette or tartar sauce or 'au naturel?' -- chilled ros\u00e9 -- Caesar salad\nw/jumbo shrimp) -- Sammi and Ben take a stroll in town (and bring me fudge!) while I\n                    \nreturn to my bed to rest. Next day, bleeding starts, which freaks me out not a little. Call\nKayla at Dr. Patel's and she advises monitoring symptoms until my return - bleeding\nlikely caused by a tumor. Feeling under the weather the whole time but manage to\ncompartmentalize and enjoy the time away - Ben comes to my room to wish my\ngoodnight each night - very calming. Next day relaxing at the pool - whirlpool feels\nterrific on my back -- love the poolside service (lemonade, iced tea, guac, but Ben and\nSammi also bring us lunch from a cute sandwich shop in town - tuna salad, Thai noodle\nsalad etc.). Ocean still not visible! Dinner at Mac's, casual place we had discovered three\nyears ago. Succulent fried clam bellies, a squirt of lemon, and tartar sauce. Is there\nanything better? Hamachi crudo. A fish curry for Ben and Sammi. Following day weather\nis poor (drizzle): Ben and Sammi hit the golf course, I get comfy on my bed w/my heating\npad. Given the weather, we opt for a nice lunch at the Sesuit Harbor Cafe in Dennis,\nrevisiting a place we had liked three years ago. Fabulous lobster roll! So fresh, just the\nright amount of mayo, a squirt of lemon, have it with coleslaw to add some crunch. I\nhave dreamt about this encounter with the perfect lobster roll for three years! I forget\nwhat we did for dinner that night; I think we brought food in from somewhere, perhaps a\nseafood shack near the hotel. Ben drives me to see nearby lighthouse at some point. We\nalso take a little drive one day -- love the Cape architecture, the shingle-covered houses,\nthe marinas, the summer hydrangeas. Shopping at Chatham Candy Manor; picked out\nchocolates and other goodies as gifts. Town  crowded with tourists. Ben and Sammi get\nice cream cones one night. Last day: lovely weather (yay). Another pool day for me. Long\nchat with an art director from Massapequa (home of the alleged Gilgo Beach murderer...\nI'm following avidly...). Many hotel guests from NY and Boston areas (do I dare wear my\nNY Yankees cap?). I never made it into the ocean, although I had intended to. Ben and\nSammi take a boat to explore a nearby beach. Frequent soaks in the whirlpool. Later that\nday, manager's reception. I'm too tired to stand and make chit-chat so I relax on one of\nmany comfy sofas in the lobby. Ben and Sammi check out the reception and meet a few\nof the chefs. Many young foreigners as servers and other staff; a lovely young man from\nCroatia serves us drinks. Lounge outside in Adirondack chairs as we take pictures of one\nanother. Dinner: return to Mac's: more clam bellies, oysters. Nightcap at the hotel: I\nindulge in a Dark and Stormy; it matches the weather outside. Ben and Sammi are\nwonderful travel companions: upbeat, solicitous, very helpful, relaxed, fun. It is always a\npleasure to spend time with them.\nLeave early for drive to NY (5 hours or so? more?). Spend evening at my mother's.\nRelaxing, comfortable, good chat. My mother always intuits what I'd like for dinner and\nso we both enjoyed delicious cold borscht from Zabar's and some mini-quiches from\nBreads Bakery (plus a babka to take home). Slept well, got up early as Sammi picked me\nup around 7:30 to drive me back to State College (so kind of her; we gabbed a bit in the\ncar). She stayed over and headed back to the city the next morning.\nHappy to have made these memories!",
    "comments": "Sounds like such a sweet and relaxing getaway with your treasured Ben and Sammi!

    "entry": "...the heavy cavalry, the big guns, the Conestoga wagons circling me, keeping me\ncomfortable, warm, safe, care-free, nutrified with healthful food and nourishing\nconversation.\nThe friends are here! The ones I've known for 40-60 years and who are like family. What\na treat.\nHard to recount everything we 'did' or will do because it is mainly about 'le feeling.' I've\nalways liked this quote attributed to George Eliot: \u201cFriendship is the inexpressible comfort of\nfeeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words.\"\nLet me insert a health update here, before returning to the cavalcade of pals: more or less status quo.\nLacking energy big time (even writing these posts seems a challenge at times, but I persist). Fatigue\nafter minimal exertion. Painkillers (Oxycodone and Morphine) help a bit. Discomfort/pain (chronic) in\nmiddle third of body, esp. pelvis, sides/back (pleura). Heating pad a necessity. Pain is not fun. Seven\n                    \nsessions of radiation down out of fifteen. Still bleeding. Hope it will stop by mid-next week, as Dr.\nPatel suggests. The thought that this course of radiation might not be successful had not even\noccurred to me until recently. Brain MRI upcoming this week, ditto for magnesium and iron infusions\nand five rounds of radiation. My spirit is willing but my body falters. It seems that I may not be able to\nstart hospice until all the radiation is done; hospice does not appear to cover the cost, or all of it. So\nI'll wait another ten days, or longer if I need more radiation on my brain. No suspicious headaches to\nspeak of in the past three months, thankfully, but I'll wait to learn about the scan results. Even minor\nactivity is tiring: a profusion of ants in my kitchen and sunroom last night taxed me. I did what I could\nw/Raid (bending down to spray the sideboards was most uncomfortable), then my friend Greg (my\nfriend Helen's husband) came over today to spray with a stronger product. The ants, which likely got\nin the house after work on my gutters last week, appear to be gone, but I find it increasingly hard to\ndeal with even minor stress such as this. Rebecca, the personal chef, will offer a 'trial run' this week\n(chicken coconut curry soup, wild salmon cakes w/dill sauce, green salad), and then I'll likely have her\ncook 2-3 meals per week for me. My house cleaner will also be here, plus the rest of my life-saving\n'crew' (Kelsey, Liz, Abbye). Rabbi Ostrich will visit me on Thursday; I have a number of items on my\nagenda to discuss with him.\nShanny drove out here from Brooklyn this week, bearing nourishing butternut squash soup and a\ngorgeous lavender orchid plant (received a magnificent bouquet of multicolored roses from my former\ngrad student and now close friend, Christi, this week; made my day. Love being surrounded by such\nbeauty. Christi's kindness and caring nature are scarcely paralleled). Shanny and I sat in my sunroom\nand gabbed (about NYU friends, family, relationships, future plans, summer adventures, what\nhappens when we die and more, with affect ranging from light and humorous to heavy and thoughtful,\nand everything in between). Thanks to her, I enjoyed an invigorating, relaxing foot massage and a\nnice dinner, to which I contributed a very good ratatouille I had made from Melissa Clark's recipe (I\nsay it is an 'aspirational' ratatouille as none can match the slick and oily -- but not too -- herby,\nintensely flavorful ratatouille with eggplant, zucchini, tomato, onion and garlic I once sampled at an\nopen-air market in Provence; that's the gold standard for me. Tonight, the rest of the NYU 'brigade'\nbegins to arrive. Vinni is flying in from Boston and will be joined by Isa and her husband Rob on\nMonday (they'll return to their country house in Laporte, PA, Monday night). On the 18th, my darling\nMitchel, my best college friend whom I first met when I was the only first-year student in a course on\nProust and was befriended by Mitchel and a friend of his, arrives from Nice via New York, where he'll\nbe visiting friends and family. I miss him so much and greatly look forward to spending time with him.\nCousin Julie arrives from Florida in early September. Ben will most likely come up for Rosh Hashanah\n(combined with a PSU football game!), and I may possibly get to see him this month too. While I was\ntired after Shanny's visit (slept twelve hours!), I also felt as though I had received a big shot of love.\nHow wonderful to be able to be so authentic with these friends, and actually *deepen* these\nfriendships. There is a balm in GIlead!\nOther visits from out of town friends might yet be scheduled. I'm so happy to spend time with these\npals before I may no longer be able to.\nI've been able to visit with other friends on drives to/from the hospital for radiation: my wonderful\nfriends Cheryl and Nancy (intense convo about food: my ratatouille - again! - and the latest Ottolenghi\nrecipes N., a fantastic cook, has been trying), Michael (who was convinced that a guy sitting next to\nme in the waiting room was a Q-Anon supporter b/c of the strange, nihilistic rhetoric he was spouting).\n                    \nYesterday, my dear former colleague and friend B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, bearing arugula and tomatoes from her\ngarden, spent a few hours with me over cold drinks and nibbles; I got caught up on department news\nand learned much more than I had ever known about B's family. And two days ago it was Ben's best\nfriend (since kindergarten?) Nikhil, who texted me to say he'd be in town to visit his parents and\nasking to visit. Nikhil lives between Boston and New York; he and Ben are thick as thieves, which\nmakes me so happy as both are stellar guys, creating excellent opportunities for themselves\nprofessionally and doing really well personally. When I think about the young men and women of this\ngeneration that I'm privileged to know (including Ben's friend group, many of his cousins, several\nformer students), I truly think there is hope for a bright future. Nikhil, who works in the biotech field, is\ncheerful, fun, smart, interesting, loyal, hard-working and polite (he insisted on washing his water glass\nbefore leaving my house!). I really enjoyed speaking with him.",

    "entry": "Health update: I don't have enough fingers to stop up the holes in the dike where the\ndeluge threatens to come roaring through, causing irrevocable damage:\nEyes: The prescription given to me at Hopkins, which I just had filled here, was incorrect,\nprobably because I was still suffering some corneal damage when the ophthalmologist\nexamined me. So new lenses are being made, to arrive next week. In the meanwhile, I'm\n(still) existing with very blurry vision, which makes me reticent to drive except for very\nshort distances. This problem will soon be taken care of, however. I just have to be\npatient. And the whole episode (getting re-examined etc.) required 'bandwidth' I really\ndon't have much of currently.\n                    \nBut that's the least of it.\nCancer throughout my body: As mentioned, middle 'third' of my body hurts. I'm no\nlonger able to sleep on my left side (which causes both dull and sharp pain under my\nribcage) and always have a heating pad near me. I'm taking morphine but at such a low\ndose that I'm not sure how much it helps. It makes me tired but that's ok.\nPelvis: Today will have eleventh round of radiation out of fifteen. Lying still on a hard\ntable for fifteen-twenty mn. hurts me; I even vomited once afterward from the pain's\nintensity. The technicians are very kind. What is most frustrating is that I'm not sure the\nradiation is working. I am still bleeding, perhaps with a less heavy flow than before, but\nI'm losing blood for sure. I just finished the final of four rounds of iron infusions; perhaps\nDr. Patel senior will prescribe additional rounds when I see him on Thursday. Will also\nhave a magnesium infusion this week. It hadn't even occurred to me that the radiation\nmight not stop the blood flow and shrink the 6 cm. tumor. I am really not sure what\nhappens next but I'll see Dr. Patel junior this afternoon.\nBrain: results of last week's MRI are in: multiple lesions show increase in size consistent\nwith progressive metastatic disease. One lesion (or spot) is 3 cm. Can these be radiated\nstereotactically, both because of their size and number (and placement)? Or is whole\nbrain radiation -- the line in the sand I said I wouldn't cross because of possible effects on\ncognition -- necessary at this point? Any other alternatives? If I won't cross the line in the\nsand and there are no other viable alternatives (gamma knife?), what happens then?\nHow slow or fast-growing are these spots/lesions? Memories of stifling headaches>time\nfor steroids (which inevitably cause me insomnia, while I've been sleeping quite well\nrecently)? \"Don't create worries,\" I am told, but frankly, this is hugely worrisome to me,\nan awful thought to wake up to this morning (although, of course, not totally\nunexpected). I'll know more this afternoon.\nThe radiation timetable is linked to hospice care. Hospice will cover five rounds of\nradiation but no more (it's all about costs, insurance). So I'll need to see if/when I'll need\nbrain radiation, and how much, before I can get on hospice. Frankly, I'm eager for extra\nhelp with pain management. On that note, I may also try medical marijuana for pain\nrelief. At least two people whose opinions I value have discussed it with me in ways that\nmake much sense.\nAppetite: practically zilch. Honestly, I could bypass food entirely but know I have to eat\n(drinking a Chobani peach yogurt beverage right now). The only tastes that appeal to me\nare cold ones: a big glass of iced tea in the morning, Perrier, Carnation instant breakfast,\nan occasional root bear float. And soup. And tastes of other things. But I can't always\nkeep the food down; vomiting and diarrhea sometimes follow *immediately* after I eat\nsomething that disagrees with me. My stomach is ultra-sensitive and, as Dr. Patel\n                    \nmentioned. my cancer is likely affecting the appetite center in my brain. I scarcely\nrecognize the completely food-obsessed enthusiast I was in the person for whom the\nmere sight of some foods makes her stomach turn. I still like to watch cooking shows and\nto imagine a scaled-down version of my ultimate foodie tour, featuring little bites of my\nfaves: one piece of oily Szechuan eggplant in garlic sauce, half a profiterole, a tiny cup of\nsummer borscht from Veselka; a quarter of a Sabrett or Nathan's hot dog with spicy\nmustard and sauerkraut.\nRebecca, whom I'm considering taking on as a private chef, cooked for me last week. Her\nfood is excellent: this first go around featured wild salmon cakes; chicken coconut soup\nwith shitake mushrooms, red bell peppers; a nice salad of corn, feta, cherry tomatoes\nand lots of fresh herbs; yogurt dill sauce. The only issue is -- you guessed it -- I can only\neat a fraction of what she makes and I don't like to waste food. Right now we're talking\nabout how she might be able to adjust portion size, which dishes freeze well etc. It still\nbeats cooking, a great pleasure of mine that has become increasingly difficult for me\nthese days (I tire after standing too long).\nEnergy/fatigue: Again, I scarcely recognize my formerly energetic self in my fatigued.\ndragged out current version. Blame the morphine? Blood loss? The physical energy my\nbody continues to direct towards fighting cancer? This past weekend I slept until nearly\nnoon, but then felt the need to lie down on my couch again right after breakfast (or\nlunch, I guess). I am still intent on getting out of bed each morning, taking a shower and\ngetting dressed but often find it harder to do much else... Many friends have visited in\nthe afternoons; one offered to take me for a drive in the country (one of my favorite\nactivities!). This has been lovely.\nEven updating my blog can be tiring. I want to continue to as long as I can both to keep\ninformed this wonderful online community of the past four+ years and to offer myself an\noutlet in writing. But I might need to engage a 'guest columnist' or two here and/or I\nmight contemplate shorter, more frequent posts commensurate with my energy level.\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, I feel badly for not yet having responded to\nsome of the many wonderful (truly) emails, cards, texts etc. I've been sent. Please\nunderstand my occasional radio silence in the context of what I've detailed above. I am\nsoooo appreciative of all your thoughtful gestures. I feel love for all of you. Please stick\nwith me! I do hope to respond, but might need to capitalize on  little energy boosts for\nthis to happen.\nI had wanted to write, on a cheerier note, about my recent visitors, but now think I will\nreserve that account for a separate post. Be well, everyone.",

Eyes, brain, pelvis, abdomen. It\u2019s a\nbrutal disease, metastatic cancer, and it comes at you from all directions. I understand\nwhy you are fatigued, friend. Remember that you can opt at any time to focus on\ncomfort above the rest. It doesn\u2019t mean you are giving up. It means that there are too\nmany concerns, too many symptoms, and it\u2019s tiring trying to deal with each. One\nshouldn\u2019t have to be at such odds with each bodily system in order to figure out how to\nstem the tide. Relax and let things be as they are.

Your words are beautiful, difficult, existential and\ninspiring all at the same time.\nIn such times, many of us find that the mind opens to journeys of memory and reflection,\nrecollections and encounters with family and friends, food, art, experiences and ideas\nthat are important, vital and transcendent.\nThe world also offers up the wisdom traditions of humanity, including the European and\nAmerican Judeo-Christian ideals. Your deep study of these traditions, principles, values\nand rituals provides vast sources of spiritual strength to draw on. I hope they offer some\ninsights, solace, inspiration and sense of fulfillment. Just as previous generations wrote\nresponsa and epistles with the goal of helping others, so too your beautiful prose speaks\nto us and many more beyond.\nIn honor of your love of cuisine and global travel, I offer a simple yet sublime recipe. I\nhope that your chef (and all our readers) can whip up this tasty, healthful dish that you\n                    \ncan enjoy in these warm Summer days as the tree fruit ripens in nearby gardens and\norchards.\nThis simple recipe comes from Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s World of the East Vegetarian Cooking, a\nbook I\u2019ve used so many times, it is marked and spotted, oil stained and scented with a\nmix of exotic herbs and sauces, from so many memorable meals. I hope you enjoy the\ndish! Big hugs and the traditional Jewish wish of Refuah Shlemah U\u2019meheira!\nFresh Peach Salad recipe:\n* 2.5 lbs fresh peaches, peeled and sliced (I don\u2019t think they need to be peeled, and\nnectarines can also be used)\n* 3 tablespoons sugar\n* 3/4 teaspoon salt\n* freshly ground black pepper to taste\n* 1.5 teaspoons ground roasted Cumin\n*1.5 tablespoons lemon juice (I prefer a bit more than she suggested)\n* 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nThen combine all ingredients in a glass, ceramic or stainless steel serving dish and serve\nat room temperature.\nLike you, Willa, this recipe is delightfully natural and delicious without affectation. It is\nlike you: sweet, salty, sharp and spicy.\nBon app\u00e9tit!\nDavid J. Blumberg\nClassmate H \u201881\nGolden Beach, FL\n  \u2014David Blumberg, August 14, 2023  \nHi Willa, definitely cannabis. Gummies or chocolate probably easier than vaping or\nanything you inhale. They take longer to take effect (20-60 mins), but then last. There's\nalso a pill version. I don't know what you can keep down. I started during chemo for\nbreast cancer and it helped with pain after my mastectomy, and with nausea. Indica is\ncalming, makes me sleepy, better than sativa (for me) which makes me jumpy and\nwired. I still use indica gummies to sleep. Your grace and openness are amazing. Just like\nyour smile! I will continue to hold you in my heart, as I have been from afar. Xoxoxo\nSusan\n  \u2014Susan Israel, August 14, 2023  \nDear Willa, you\u2019re never too far from my thoughts\u2026I\u2019m sad to hear about your loss of\n                    \nappetite and hope that returns\u2014cooking and eating your creations are great loves of\nyours. You continue to write which is another great love and maybe therapeutic (though\ntiring, I\u2019m sure). I hope you get to go for a ride in the country soon!! Hugs!!\n  \u2014Rebecca Bressler, August 15, 2023  \nDear Willa, my experience with pain, nausea and sleeplessness, albeit under way less\nserious circumstances, leads me to second Sue Israel\u2019s recommendation.

    "entry": "A few more points of medical update before turning (in another post) to more uplifting\ntopics such as recent visits from a few angels:\n*In what passes for 'good news' these days, today I will finish my fifteen rounds of\nradiation to staunch bleeding from a tumor on my vaginal cuff. I hope the memory of\nhaving to lie my cancer-ridden back on a rock-hard table and hold still for fifteen minutes\nwill soon recede; perhaps time will efface in ways that Morphine, Oxycodone, and Ativan\nwere unable to. I was unable to complete only one treatment (due to anxiety), while\nanother treatment -- but again only one -- ended with my vomiting copiously into a bag\nthe technicians provided. I guess that's not too bad a record. I hope they let me smash a\ngong or something today to mark the occasion, or perhaps I'll just pilfer an extra Diet\nCoke or two from the fridge in the waiting room. Best of all, in the end, I do think the\nradiation succeeded in stopping the bleeding. Dr. Patel said this trend towards total 'shut\noff' could continue for up to four weeks after radiation ends.\nA big thank you to Susan and the other techs who were so kind to me and always\ncomplimented my clothes (and eye shadow, when I wore it), even when I felt like a\nwretch.\nAnother huge thank you and hurrah to everyone who shuttled me back and forth to/from\nradiation, taking time out of your busy days, boosting my morale, making sure I go to my\nappointments on time, providing sustenance in the form of spirited convo -- and/or soup\nor lasagna! Thanks to my angels Jackie, Helen, Cheryl, Nancy, Michael, Sandy, Kathryn,\nMar, Maria and Natalie. Please let me know if I've omitted anyone - I hope not!\n*MRI update: In response to the last MRI, which shows new lesions as well as recurrence\nof certain prior mets, Dr. Patel junior is recommending waiting six weeks and then\nrescanning, to see what if anything may have changed. He is averse to retreating\nalready treated areas such as my cerebellum, where there is now a 3 cm 'thing' (could\nbe cancer, could be necrosis). He'll send me to a neurosurgeon colleague of his in\nHershey if I want a consult, to explore surgical options. He thinks any symptoms I might\nstart to have will come on gradually; his office sent in a script for Dexameth. today in\ncase headaches return (memories of  the frightful, unbearable headaches that preceded\nremoval of my brain tumor by the superb Dr. Bettegowda at Hopkins, whom I plan to\nconsult to see if he concurs w/Dr. P's assessment of my situation). At first I thought that\nDr. P. was kicking the can, punting, 'giving up on me,' or what have you, but I now\nbelieve he understands my preference at this point for not going hard against my\ndisease, opting instead for quality of life. So I'll likely go along with his recommendation,\nrelieved to have a break from radiation for  now. This in turn means that I can get on\nboard the hospice train as early as Monday, when a nurse will visit me at home for\nintake, more general discussion of hospice care etc. What hospice will and will not cover\n                    \n($-wise) is still a little murky to me: seems to depend both on $$ concerns (when does it\nnot??) and on the overarching 'quality of life over aggressive treatment' philosophy of\nhospice. We'll see how this plays out.\nI'm on my way to getting a medical marijuana card! As initially described to me, the\nprocess for getting one seemed daunting but it really wasn't in the end. I filled out a form\nonline (PA Dept. of Health); spoke by phone for about fifteen minutes with a local doctor\n(very nice, also confronting cancer now) who 'certified' me; and finally filled out another\nPA Dept. of Health form. Total cost for processing plus phone visit with local doctor:\n$250. Now I await my card, which I'm told should arrive within five to twenty-one days.\nThen I'll shop at one of our four local dispensaries, where a pharmacist will help me with\nwhat I need based on my profile. Dr. Ejianreh suggested tinctures or an edible called\n'troches' (?). I'm not sure my lungs could handle smoking. Who knew I'd be back to weed\nafter decades? Hope it helps with the pain.\nFinal update: Radiation, done. I was 'privileged' to ring a bell when I exited the treatment\nroom, surrounded by the wonderful, compassionate team of technicians (one of them\nrecorded the moment, but I don't think CB lets me post it).\nWriting quickly now and finishing up as I await my dear college friend Mitchel, fresh off\nthe Megabus from NY (and, prior to that, fresh off the plane from Nice!). I'm so looking\nforward to being with him and will report when I'm able.\nHere's to a restful and restorative and beautiful shabbos.",

    "entry": "F\u00e9e du logis = (literally) fairy of the dwelling-place; in my lexicon, fairy godperson,\ntutelar deity, magical helper and healer in the home.\nIf you want to know the recipe for helping me feel better physically these days (or any\nday, really), arrange a visit for me with one of my oldest, dearest friends. Maybe it's the\ncure for cancer, who knows? I've mulled over how to write this post, how to explain the\nlove I feel for my friends, but I'm not sure I can offer anything entirely cohesive. These\nare the sound bites that come to me when I think about the recent visits from Shanny,\nVinni, Isabelle and her husband Rob (also my old friend) and Mitchel: Chosen family.\nWrapped in a cocoon of love. Soul connection. Vibing. Feeling radiant, perhaps even\n'radiating,' 'levitating' with happiness. Immense comfort and sense of well-being. A large\npiece of furniture with drawers - \"un gros meuble \u00e0 tiroirs,\" in Baudelaire's imagining - \noverflowing with memories. A safe space to feel all the feels, share all the thoughts.\nFriendships that mellow, deepen, complexify, improve with age (ok, yes, like the fine\nwines that we've shared many of over the years). Adventures, joyous occasions and sad\nones, 'fous rires' (laughing fits), tears, hugs. Our commitment to one another.\nForty, forty-five years of continuous connection, continuous involvement in each other's\nlives. Mitchel and I met in a seminar on Proust my freshman year at Harvard, taught by a\nwaiflike British woman, Camille Naish, always late for class. I was the only freshman in\n                    \nthe class; Mitchel, a sophomore,  befriended me, we clicked instantly, the hit the ground\nrunning. Shanny, Vinni, Isa (and Rob) and I all met in grad school at NYU, such formative\nyears. I've always felt that a crucial part of our bond was the one we shared as women\ntrying, over the decades, to succeed in both our professional and personal lives (and\nmaybe finally having figured it out). We've all been up in one another's business: Vinni\nlived with Isa and Rob in NY (Shanny may have too, at another point); Vinni, Shanny and\nI shared a swanky apartment in Paris for a year, while Vinni and I took another Paris\napartment for the two of us the following year. We've been roomies at countless\nacademic conferences. Our four quite different personalities have always meshed so\nwell. The two 'dumb blondes' and the two 'dumb brunettes.' Les filles.\n\"J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mille ans....\" (Baudelaire, again). Mitchel and I\nsharing our first trip to Italy at twenty (he was twenty-one). Broke but wildly dazzled by\nthe art! the food! the beautiful people!, we romped through Italy from north to south,\narmed with a backpack and Eurail pass. Mitchel and I around the corner neighbors in NY\nwhen he attended the law school and we were at the Institute of French Studies.\n\"Tonton\" (uncle) Mitchel taking little Ben out for Chinese dinner in Paris so Michael and I\ncould enjoy a date. Big Ben and his French tontons Mitchel, Randy and Fabien brunching\nat the bustling march\u00e9  d'Aligre on Christmas eve day. Mitchel becoming best friends\nwith my dear grad school friend Randy (who now lives in Paris); both of them blending\ninto my Institute friend group of V, S and I. Vinni and I getting lost one New Year's Eve in\na deserted area of Madrid dominated by a massive bull ring, in a desperate attempt to\nfind our friend Phillip's apartment (way  before cell phones), following a week of end of\nyear revelry. This now-legendary story is one we like to recount to our adult sons.\nShanny adding salt instead of sugar to the apple pie that we were to serve our French\nguests at our 'real American' Thanksgiving dinner in Paris. Many dinners and parties at\nIsa and Rob's apartment on E. 17th st. in NY. Our 'French parents,' Math\u00e9 and Robert\n(Isa's parents) nicely inviting us to 'crash' with them whenever we arrived in Paris in the\nvery early morning hours; sweat-inducing attempts to cram my luggage into that tiny\nParisian elevator in their building in the 11e.  Isa and Rob's wedding in Camp Hill, PA;\nShanny's in Brooklyn; Vinni's wedding dinner at a wonderful Indian restaurant in the\nVillage (to which she invited my mother); mine in State College. \"Long ago, it must be, I\nhave a photograph.\"\nI could go on and on and on while being mindful not to let the past overwhelm the\npresent.\n\"These fragments I have shored against my ruins.\"\nSo these visits -- consecutive except for Vinni's overlapping with Isa and Rob's for part of\na day -- could not *not* be wonderful. Shanny gave me a foot massage. Vinni and I\nindulged in ice cream cones from Meyer Dairy and had some laughs over a Borat movie,\nwhich we watched in our p.j.s. I was spoiled with divine-smelling gifts from Fresh (Vinni),\n                    \nGuerlain and Fragonard (Mitchel) -- I tell ya, these pals understand my olfactory\nobsession! We ate - and ate - and drank - and cooked - and ate some more. Extended\ncocktail hours (G&Ts, Negronis, summer ros\u00e9s). Salmon expertly prepared by my f\u00e9es du\nlogis. Homemade butternut squash soup thanks to Shanny. Mainly, we gabbed and\ngabbed, about everything: our families, memories, mortality, our summer goings-on.\nWe'll never run out of things to talk about.\nTired yet still 'light' today. A visit in my sunroom from my dear friend Helen was the\nperfect complement to the weekend.\nShavua tov.\nPhotos",

    "entry": "This week brought a bunch of medical appointments as my new home hospice paradigm\nfalls into place. This means some different personnel, meds, schedules. On Monday, a\nnurse from the UPMC (University of Pittsburgh) hospice team, Mollie, came to visit, to get\nintake and physically assess me. The UPMC team is in regular touch with my palliative\ncare doctor, Dr. Vithalani. I wasn't certain how this visit would be much different from\nthat of Amanda, an account executive (not a nurse) at UPMC home health, a few weeks\nearlier. No matter. The bottom line is that our two-hour meeting was (imo) a stressful\n                    \ndisaster. Mollie could not answer my questions about what specifically my Highmark\ninsurance through PSU would cover or not regarding home hospice (there seems to be\nmuch gray area here....). She spent about an hour on the phone with her supervisor\nfiguring this out for me. For another twenty-thirty minutes of the two-hour visit, she read\nto me the 'fine print' of their various hospice care policies, in a monotone voice that had\na soporific effect (\"You are getting tired....very tired...\"). That left just a bit of time for her\nto take my vitals and ask me a few questions. I said I wouldn't sign an agreement until I\nknew exactly what my out of pocket costs would be, and for which services. No wonder\nmanaged care and insurance behemoths have such a bad rep in this country!\nShortly after Mollie left, supervisor Amanda called and asked me how the visit had gone.\nI minced no words, and also asked to have a different head nurse assigned to my team\nfor the duration.\nThe next day, a different nurse, Laura, came to visit. I definitely clicked better with her\nthan with Mollie, even in terms of cultural background (I'll leave it at that for now, but\ndefinitely a consideration in these parts). She looked quite young but said she had been\nhospice nursing for about five years. Any questions she couldn't answer received\nresponses from another team member the next day. She was quite thorough and careful.\nShe helped me get organized in an important way, by bringing (at no cost to me) a new,\nmultiweek, pill organizer in which she portioned out my next week's worth or so of\nmedications (still some kinks to be worked out with this system but I'm sure I'll get\nthere). Finally, as she noticed I was sometimes short of breath, she arranged for a local\nmed equipment place to bring me (again, for free) a portable oxygen dispenser (but not\na tank) attached to a canula (I was given several extras of these as well). When she left, I\nasked her, among other questions, whether she'd be 'my' head nurse going forward. She\nsaid it wasn't certain, depending as it does on nurses' schedules, case loads, driving\ndistance etc. but she could put in a request. I felt a bit crestfallen at this news, as I want\nto feel confident in my trust in the nurse caring for me through this emotion-laden life\nexperience. Good news the next day, though, when Laura returned for a second visit:\nshe has indeed signed on as my head nurse (in view of weekly visits, most likely). In\nturn, I agreed to the UPMC terms and conditions  whose vague nature had complicated\nour early communication. Signed, sealed, delivered!\nI think I'm getting my pain under control with morphine and oxycodone. It does make me\nkinda loopy and less mentally acute or agile then I usually am. I'm hoping these\ncapabilities return. I also seem to awake in the middle of the night with night sweats -\ncan't tell if this might be from the heat pad that keeps me comfy at night or something\nelse. And I have occasional, odd aural 'tics, sharp sounds (like those of clanging metal\npipes) that I hear when I'm in a sort of liminal state between sleep and awakeness.\nMeanwhile, the cheffing/cleaning and straightening/errand running/clothes and\ndishwashing/bed-making structure provided by Liz and Kelsey, Abbye, Pati and Rebecca\n                    \nworks excellently right now. I can't thank these women enough for their care and\nservice.  \nMy very dear friends continue to provide me with  all kinds of sustenance, including\nspiritual. This past week has brought or will bring visits from Helen, Jackie (bearer of a\nMeyer root bear float), Maria and perhaps Lisa for a jaunt in the countryside tomorrow.  A\nformer student, Casey, came over for iced tea and sweets yesterday. I'm so glad she's\ncontinuing to chase down wonderful opportunities for herself. This coming year she'll be\nliving in Hamburg and working at the site of the former Neuengamme  concentration\ncamp, creating digital content for the camp's website and participating in public\noutreach (she'd like to work in a museum, eventually). Casey's visit made me remember\nmy excitement about working with undergraduates and helping them achieve their\ngoals.\nBen also arrives tomorrow for about five days. I can't wait to see him.\nGosh, I hope this post is coherent. I really doubt my cognitive functioning some days!\n \n \n \nPhotos",
    "comments": "What a marathon, Willa -- but with the happy end of having a caring and competent head\nnurse for your hospice care in place! Have a wonderful visit with Ben, whom I'll hope to\ncatch a glimpse of sometime next week. XO, K\n  \u2014Kathryn Grossman, August 26, 2023  \nHospice, more than any other kind of medical care, is supposed to be about comfort and\nreassurance. I\u2019m so glad you stuck up for what you needed and Laura could return and\nbe assigned to you. My mother suffered needlessly for days because her physician\nwouldn\u2019t approve her transition to hospice, which we came to find out was because she\ncouldn\u2019t remain my mother\u2019s physician on hospice. Only on hospice would they provide\nadequate pain relief. Glad you have a formidable team to keep the day-to-day activities\nrunning smoothly.\n  \u2014David Miranda, August 26, 2023  \nYour post is very coherent - almost shockingly given your pain meds - not shockingly\ngiven your birth brain and writing skills.\nI love how clear and insistent you were about what you needed from hospice. For one of\nthe very most important life experiences, a lot of people tragically get shut down and\nbizarrely become unheard during this time. You are the poster child of how to do it!\nI am so glad Ben will be there soon. You are firmly in my heart.\n  \u2014Jane Ginsberg, August 26, 2023  \nI\u2019m so glad you found Laura as your head nurse in hospice and that you are home and\ncomfortable and have a great team in place, friend! Sending you my love and soothing\nwishes! \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, August 26, 2023  \nSo glad to hear of Laura, and real pain relief, and Ben\u2019s upcoming arrival. I am amazed\nbut not at all surprised by the lucidity of your post \u2014and I am sending you all my love \u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, August 26, 2023  \nTo be continued....the agency sent someone else the next time. I am glad that you have\n                    \nyour essential needs taken care of and so competently by your local helpers. Keep up\nthe milkshakes and floats and whatever else puts a smile on your face.\n(If this message comes through in a disjointed way, pls let me know. Computer glitch at\nwork here.)\n  \u2014Marlene Green, August 26, 2023  \nI\u2019m sorry for the aggravation you endured, Willa, and am glad (but not at all surprised)\nthat you advocated for yourself and got it sorted. I hope the help from friends, ice cream,\nand most of all, Ben\u2019s visit will keep you feeling very loved and comfortable. Sending\nmuch love.\n  \u2014Melissa Beattie Moss, August 26, 2023  \nWay to hang in there, and stand up for your needs, glad Laura is the one. It is all very\ncoherent, and well written, rest assured. :-) Glad to hear Ben is coming for a visit.\n  \u2014Jessica Karp, August 26, 2023  \nDear Willa,\nAlways inspiring, leading, learning and teaching - sending love \u2764\ufe0f and wishing you\nphysical comfort and the warmth of your wonderful friends. It is good to know that Laura\nis your head Nurse at home.\n  \u2014Nicole Kohn, August 26, 2023  \nHow heartwarming that the excitement you felt helping undergraduates achieve their\ngoals now returns, largely thanks to your courage, dedication and perspicacity! As Jane\nGinsberg says, you are the poster child of how to get what you need from hospice! Enjoy\nBen's visit. XOxo\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, August 26, 2023  \nYou advocated for your needs and persevered! So glad you have Laura as your head\nnurse and the other wonderful team of helpers. You are remarkable, admired and loved\nby so many!\n  \u2014Marica Tacconi, August 26, 2023  \nYou're amazing, Willa! I don't know how you manage to focus on all the details of the\nmaze that is in our healthcare system while you are going through this challenging time\nin your life's journey. Willa Power!\n                    \n  \u2014Jean Najjar, August 27, 2023  \nSorry things were not simpler, but you sound very lucid and glad you took the reins and\ngot things taken care of. Countdown to Ben! \u2764\ufe0f\n  \u2014David Margolis, August 27, 2023  \nThank you for your inspiring update. It must be so stressful dealing with lack of\ninformation, incompetence (perhaps lack of training), ambiguity. I appreciate your clarity\nand always open, gracious heart!\n  \u2014Mark Feinberg, August 27, 2023  \nThat you manage to keep on top of all the research and organization throughout is\nastonishing. This entry was no less eloquent than usual but strikingly lucid - ironic in\nview of your fear of its revealing a lessening of your cognitive powers.\nI don't think you could ever go down the river in that regard because of the wealth of\ncognitive reserve you start with, by birth and by a lifetime of exercise. Plenty of\nsynapses to fall back on!\nThank you for inviting me a few years back, to follow your intimate and educational\njourney. I had no idea what I was in for - such a roller coaster in every way, and an on-\ngoing life lesson which is proving to be a great gift.\nEverything seems to be happening at the right time, uplifting or stressful, and always\nillustrating your genius at living life to the fullest at every point. Thank heaven for the\nbrilliant and compassionate invention of hospice!\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, August 27, 2023  \nHello Dear Willa\nJust read your content - I realize how difficult the situation must be to be dealing not only\nwith the illness but all the paper work!!\nThis is definitely difficult when you get sick in the US. Not the same system as in most\nEuropean countries.\nI am finally back after 4 months - nearly 2 months in Africa out of the 4\nI am readjusting to NY and it feels good to be home for a bit as I will be leaving in 2\nweeks to Italy for my show opening. I should only be gone for 1 week\nunless I need to go to Paris for work. It's been quite difficult for a while as people aren't\nfocusing on buying art - the cost of living not only here but also in\nEurope has become out of control!! As mentioned, I will probably move back to France in\nthe near future as I do not see myself getting older here. My parents, who I saw in\n                    \nAvignon several times during my trip, of course like the idea of me being closer\ngeographically.\nI wish you all the strength to keep your spirit up - I am so glad that Ben is coming to visit\n- I know that the 2 of you are so close - this is really wonderful.\nLet me know if you are planning to come to NY at some point - I would love to see you.\nMuch love from me. Bisous Laurent\n  \u2014laurent badessi, August 28, 2023  \nSoooo happy to hear from you, cher ami! Ben is here now and sends love. Nous\nt\u2019embrassons tr\u00e8s fort tous les deux. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n  \u2014Willa Silverman, August 28, 2023  \n  \n August 31, 2023 - Transitions",

    "entry": "This week brought more 'transitioning' into hospice care and from there to thinking and\ntalking about, and envisioning, the contours of end of life care. I'm feeling more or less\nstatus quo, which means fatigued much of the time, seriously lacking appetite (to the\npoint where the sight or taste of most food actually revolts me -- who could ever have\nimagined this??!), and short of breath. I've hit on the right cocktails for pain\nmanagement (Morphine + Oxycodone + [as needed] Ativan) and sleep (Morphine +\nTrazadone + Tylenol p.m.). Both are well-controlled; sleep is sound and restful (in my\ndreams last night I was looking for a group I could daven with...). And Ben has been here\nall week, which of course is a natural mood lifter. He efficiently prepares our meals,\nmakes sure I'm comfortable, runs errands for me. And he's just so darn pleasant to be\naround. We watched _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,_ which imo has not aged well as\na film. Tomorrow he's not working, so we'll be off for a jaunt in the country, specifically to\nan apiary that my house cleaner recommended, on a road dotted with farm stands.\nTales of hospice, part II: On Monday, Kelly, the social worker attached to my hospice\nteam, came to visit. She impressed upon me the necessity of getting a plan in place for\nmy end of life care *asap* (because sometimes bodily  changes  can occur very rapidly,\nshe said; other of my nurses and doctors, conversely, have conveyed the opposite, that\nthings will devolve gradually). She laid out three avenues she thought I should/could\npursue to ensure my access to competent end of life caregiving: a)agencies supplying\nround the clock assistance if needed. In the same breath, though, she shared her\n                    \nwariness of this option; in her opinion, local agencies, short-staffed since the onset of\nCovid, are not always reliable -- and their staff is certainly underpaid. She sent me a list\nof local agencies that I am supposed to contact myself -- no rest for the weary, I\nsuppose...b)caregivers identified via word of mouth, potentially a group comprised of\nwilling and able friends and family members. c)\"placement.\" The very word makes me\nshudder. I will not pursue this option. It is not the death I desire. I want to be at home. If\nKelly had been a bit more empathic, I think I would have 'digested' all this information\nmore easily but her fairly cold affect only agitated me. :(\nMy meeting with Kelly left me feeling deflated and stressed (hey, isn't this the stage\nwhen I'm supposed to be \"pursuing what brings me joy?\"). I looked forward to hashing it\nall out with Ashley, my oncology therapist, the next day.\nMy conversation with Ashley proved quite helpful. Together, we worked out what seems\na feasible Plan A and backup Plan B going forward, tailored to my wishes. I'll likely share\nmore about these plans going forward, but won't divulge more for now as I'm still\nworking out the details for myself and those involved. Ashley also floated the idea of\nhiring a death doula who might act as another compassionate presence at the end stage,\nbut in a way different from that of the hospice team (death doulas do not necessarily\nhave medical training, for example). I am attracted to the types of services death doulas\ncan provide: creating a serene environment in my home, bedroom (in my mind's eye, I\nsee candles, flowers, an immaculately clean space, hear music and psalms being read;\ninhale lovely scents; create any additional legacy projects that appeal to me. I consider\nmy Caring Bridge blog, close to 400 entries strong, the most significant legacy of this\nlast phase of my life, but I may wish to gather photos, write letters, communicate video\nmessages. We'll see if I have sufficient energy to produce the creative work I'm thinking\nabout. [I should mention that there appears to be a death doula in State College! Who\nknew?! I will call her for a consultation.]\nToday was busy. Nurse Laura, whom I've met twice now, arrived around noon. We talked\nabout how I was feeling and remedies for certain problems (she ordered a cane for me,\nfor example). We also talked a good deal about end of life care (hospice will probably\nmake a home visit once a day at this point but it's clear I'll need some supplemental\nhelp). She then organized and refilled my pill box for the week. We're communicating\nwell and slowly learning more about each other's lives; she admired my framed family\nphotos and was astounded by how much I look like my grandmother, Bessie. I learned\nthat she has a two-year-old daughter and (somewhat randomly) that she had kept her\nown last name when she married. My hunch is that she's pretty outdoorsy, off on\nvacation tomorrow to Bryce Canyon National Park with her father. In any event, her laid-\nback manner made me feel much more at ease about getting 'personnel' in place\nimmediately for the final stage (\"it always works itself out,\" she reassured).\nBy this time, Rebecca, 'my' (!) personal chef, had arrived, leaving me two hours later\n                    \nwith two large containers of tomato basil soup and a goat cheese and veggie frittata. \nA bit later that afternoon, my 'helper' Liz came by to tidy up, wash some dishes, make\nmy bed, water plants, cut up watermelon etc. We wound up conversing rather intensely\nabout the trauma she had experienced growing up as a member of a cult-like church; I\ntried to be a good and helpful listener as I feel kindly towards this young woman (and\ntowards Kelsey, too). I am so grateful to be surrounded by this small army of smart,\nefficient, interesting women. They definitely lift me up.\nBen and I rounded out the afternoon at a newish brewery in town (root beer for me, an\nIPA for Ben), just chilling in lawn chairs in the mellow late-August sun. Ben returns to\nBrooklyn on Saturday but will actually make another trip here -- this one for two weeks -\nfive days later! He's bringing a group of his friends to experience a PSU football game\nand the raucous partying downtown that usually ensues. I'm looking forward to meeting\nthem, and to having Sammi here for a week, along with Ben of course.",
    "comments": "Thank you, Willa, for your beautifully heartful, wise, insightful, informative, intriguing\nAND vividly described post -- as always, my precious cousin. Your gift for summarizing all\nthat you're facing, and the pleasures that continue to bring you joy (Ben, country drives,\nyummy soups, inspiring people who cross your path) remains so strong -- and so\ndelightful to read.

You never know...\n  \u2014Marlene Green, August 31, 2023  \nDear Willa, I am so grateful to you for your beautiful and heart-felt and open writing\u2014I\nonly wish I lived closer these days, as I used to\u2014but in the meantime you have all my\nlove and admiration for all of who you are xoxoxo\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, August 31, 2023  \nOh, Willa I so admire your thoughtful candor (if that combo makes sense). You are such a\nspirit guide for me as I imagine whatever will be my future medical challenges and facing\n                    \nmortality. It certainly isn\u2019t for the feint of heart! But, I\u2019ve never imagined that you could\ncontinue to show us how you sort the whole panoply of feelings as they arise in response\nto each new piece of medical news. Your strength and your honesty are remarkable, my\nfriend! As a doctor and as any adult, Ive encountered death many times in friends and\nfamily. Never have I been privy to the way news comes in these things, how it feels, how\nit gets processed. Just remarkable to have been witness to your long journey thus far\nwith ovarian cancer. An awful disease! My goodness. You continue to be an example,\nWilla, and I only hope I can face these hurdles as you have- not with ease and aplomb\nbut with a fullness of honest feelings that you had to process. One has little choice.\nThank you, my friend. I hope you know you are always in my prayers and I mention you\nwhen I say Misheberach.\nXO\nAndrew\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, August 31, 2023  \nThis blog is most certainly a legacy, thank you for your candor and honesty. Thinking of\nyou. \n  \u2014Jessica Karp, August 31, 2023  \nIt brings me peace of mind (so, thank you) to see how at peace you are with what\u2019s\ncoming, and also to know you are surrounded by all the support that you need, of the\nkind that you want. I imagine that underneath the flurry of activities you engaged in as\nyou were refusing to \u201cleave the party\u201d, you quietly allowed a little undercurrent of\nthought to work at preparing you for a graceful acceptance of that which you could only\npartially defeat. But this partial defeat is in itself remarkable! And your acceptance is\ntoo\u2026 Not sure if, as your friend, I am quite there, yet \u2026 A big hug - M\n  \u2014Monique Yaari, August 31, 2023  \nOh, Willa! We here are all transitioning with you.\nShame about Kelly. Every even slightly cold or unfeeling vibe given off by those\nentrusted with your care now, can so dampen your spirits which (at least here) you have\nmanaged to keep on top of, throughout this saga.\nYou're doing everything right - being true to yourself, advocating and choosing every\nstep of the way how you want it to go - looking ahead as far as you need to for planning\nwhile dwelling solidly in the present and seizing every bit of pleasure possible. Very\ngrateful your pain management is being handled so well, and that you are sleeping\nsoundly.\n                    \nI think I can guarantee that every one of your readers will think of you when their time\ncomes. \"What would Willa do now? How can I sculpt my departure as beautifully as Willa\ndid? You are a standard bearer.\n\"Way to go,\" Willa!\"\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, September 1, 2023  \nHi Willa, root beer is better than beer anyways. I am loving your determination to keep\nyour joy throughout all. Who knew staying joyful requires an iron will? Like my dad, you\nare living up to the last minute; an inspiration and a model for us all. Grace, grit and joy.\nYour legacy is you and everything you taught us. You go girl. Xoxo\n  \u2014Susan Israel, September 1, 2023  \ni\u2019m just back from france for my niece\u2019s wedding. as i walked the streets of paris,\nespecially the Marais, i thought of you often, of your resilience, your strength, your\nwisdom, but mostly your ability to find joy and beauty in this stage of life. so\nappreciative we connected during our reunion. so appreciative of you.\n  \u2014Debra cohn, September 1, 2023  \nWilla your writing has so much clarity. I read this and picture myself beside you as you\nwrite, your zest for life, endless possibilities, and your caring for others (both your\nfeelings and theirs) is always there. I am so happy Ben\u2019s visit was uplifting (I had no\ndoubt, what a great son you have). I\u2019m also happy you are thinking about YOU. Sending\na hug your way and know I\u2019m thinking about you.\n  \u2014Rebecca Bressler, September 1, 2023  \nA well-ordered combination of pain & sleep management meds is a significant blessing!\nGlad to read that you've landed on one. Every trouble is eased by adequate sleep. You're\nin my thoughts.\n  \u2014Christopher Walker, September 1, 2023  \nThere is nothing quite as beautiful as someone living this stage with grace and insight\nand the ability to love. Not everyone can do it but when someone can, it is a gift for\neveryone involved. I watched my mother do it and now you. My heart is full of you.\n  \u2014Jane Ginsberg, September 1, 2023  \nLove you Willa!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n                    \n  \u2014Steven Clark, September 1, 2023  \nWilla: I know you're writing this with great fatigue, and with much on your mind. But your\nwriting sings. I don't know how you do it. I tied the ribbons for OC awareness today in\ndowntown Mount Pleasant, and had you in my mind the whole time. It wfas a quiet\nprayer for you in the sun of this first day of September. But outwardly I spoke of my\nfriend (you!) who's got grace and wit in spades. While I am not in State College with you\nnow, I was with you here for the better part of the afternoon, and it made me happy.\nEnjoy your time with Ben (now and later) and Sammi. I will be thinking of you as the new\nyear approaches, and hope that you've got the energy to take some moments to enjoy\nit. I'll come after the holidays if you're up to it. LOVE AND HUGS.\n  \u2014Christi Brookes, September 1, 2023  \nAll of us who are older think of our inevitable demise, but only you face the unknown\nintelligently, with courage, humility, grace and wit, enjoyment, strength, searching for\nassistance and grateful for help, kindness, love and friendship! All the comments are\noverflowing with amazement and admiration, leading to hallowed vows to follow your\nexample, model and inspiration! A true standard bearer for all that is most precious!\nThank you! XOXO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, September 2, 2023  \n  \nSeptember 2, 2023 - Radical acceptance on a lovely day",

    "entry": "In several recent comments on my latest posts, I've been lauded for my 'gracious\nacceptance' of my current situation. While I'd never want to criticize anyone's personal,\nsubjective, and well-intentioned reaction to something I've written, I do want to clarify\nunequivocally, at least for myself, what I consider an important point: I do not accept\nhow my cancer has uprooted every fiber of my life. In fact, I find my entire situation\ntotally unacceptable. It is obscene, hideous, sad beyond measure. I had contemplated\ndevoting an entire post to my regret over being unable to realize some of my most\ndeeply-cherished goals -- loving on my (future) grandchildren, writing another book or\nmore, reveling in a part-time life in Paris. It often makes me so sad to think about these\nlosses, though, that I *accept* in order to *survive.* And I do try to be happy and grateful\n-- and doing so brings me much pleasure -- that I did have so many wonderful\nexperiences, that I *was* that girl, then woman, that accomplished so much, met so\nmany incredible people, had so many adventures, travelled, raised a useful human,\ncultivated many durable friendships, produced award-winning scholarship, mentored\ndozens of students -- and more. I also understand, and I suppose accept, that my\ndistressing situation is motivated; it's simply the result of having a monstrous, often\nincurable (and in my case not genetically predetermined) disease, the result of a bunch\nof cells going rogue. That is the reality of my situation; I'm unconvinced that any\nattempts to fight against it will fix it, certainly not at this point. But if I change my\nperception of it, the crisis I've confronted for the past four+ years indeed becomes easier\nto 'accept,' a fairly simple-sounding yet meaningful lesson I gleaned from reading Viktor\nFrankl's _Man's Search for Meaning._\nI don't know if any of this makes sense. And I admit the possibility of my feelings\nchanging at any point in the future. To be honest, some of my equanimity and calm\naffect do surprise even me at times. Perhaps, as palliative doctor B.J. Miller writes in his\nTedX talk on \"What Really Happens at the End of Life,\" \"you can always find a shock\nof beauty or meaning in what life you have left,\" I have found such 'shocks of\nbeauty' in the many random (and not so random) acts of pure love and\ncompassion and kindness and helpfulness that I've been privileged to be the\nrecipient of. \"If we love such moments ferociously,\" Miller advises, \"then\nmaybe we can learn to live well \u2013 not in spite of death, but because of it.\u201d It's\nall part of the 'cosmic crescendo' (Miller's term, I believe) that I hope will\nwhoosh me up until the end of my days.\n'Shocks of beauty.' Yesterday was full of them. Ben had the day off, so we\nagreed to take back roads in the next county over from ours to reach an\napiary my housecleaner had recommended. It was one of those perfect days\nweather-wise, 'back to school' weather: mellow sunlight dappling the trees\n                    \nwith patches of yellow and gold, warmth with little bursts of cooler breeze\nrustling the leaves, corn stalks as 'high as an elephant's eye,' cows lounging\nlazily in the fields, silos punctuating the large expanses of farmland. Stillness.\nWe stopped first at Tati's bakeshop in Pleasant Gap to pick up croissants for\nthe next day's breakfast (Tati is the superb baker who's created my last two\nbirthday cakes, the last one festooned with gold foiled ginkgo leaves). Then\nwe drove about 25 miles towards Lamar, where after several turns we arrived\nat Plunkett Road (which I never would have found had Pati not tipped me off).\nAcross from what looked like an old (colonial?) cemetery, which I would have\nwanted to explore had I had more stamina, a small open shack boasted an\narray of honeys inside, alongside pamphlets with teachings from the Gospel of\nJohn. I fretted about whether I could leave a check in the cash box as I had\nforgotten my $ at home. Fortunately, a friendly-looking Mennonite woman who\nowned the farm with her husband returned from grocery shopping in time to\ntell us that we could certainly leave a check. Honey is essential for the 'sweet\nnew year' we wish each other at Rosh Hashanah (i.e. in mid-September), and I\nlove to shop for different types of honey before the holiday, both for cooking\n(honey cake! tzimmes!) and coating with crisp, cold apple slices.\nI offered Ben the choice for lunch of either the Hublersburg Inn, an old country\ninn along a former post road surrounded by farmland or, closer to State\nCollege, a casual new restaurant featuring Georgian specialties (i.e. from the\ncountry of Georgia!). He/we opted for the latter. At Cafe Luna we ran into\nDerek Polay, Tatiana the baker's husband and an excellent chef himself (they\noccasionally host pop-up dinners showcasing Tati's Peruvian heritage). I am\ngrateful for any signs of an emergent, interesting State College food 'scene.' I\nhad a hot vegetarian borscht (absolutely delicious, the cure (?) for the\nconcerning loss of appetite that has plagued me recently), while Ben had\nPelmeni soup (featuring a special type of dumpling). We shared 'boureka\nbites,' flaky pastry filled with a yummy spinach and cheese filling. I felt tired\nafter our active (for me) day, so I crashed when we returned. Lying peacefully\non the couch with late-afternoon light streaming into my sunroom felt both\nimmensely calming and reinvigorating. \nWhat else? Thursday. Laura (the nurse from UPMC hospice) spent an hour or\nso here, refilling and organizing my pill box, ordering some equipment for me\n(e.g. a three-pronged cane), talking about how I'm feeling (as mentioned, pain\nseems to be under control right now; if I don't take the meds, though, the pain\n                    \nin my pleura can be unbearable). While Laura and I were talking in the\nsunroom, Rebecca was in my kitchen whipping up a delicious tomato and basil\nsoup (hard to resist, which is really good news for me now) and a goat cheese\nand veggie frittata. Then Liz came by to tidy up and help with other tasks\naround the house. With these three capable young women around, I felt\nparticularly well-supported!\nThis morning I bought my first cannabis products! The pharmacist first took\nabout 45 minutes to provide an overview: a)benefits of CBD v THC (the two\nproducts I bought contain a mixture), b) mode of administration (I bought a\ntincture and some edible troches, kind of like a cough drop); c) organization of\nPA Dept. of Health and cannabis distribution within it (it is all very well\nregulated; I did understand by innuendo, though, that many people use the\nproducts primarily recreationally rather than medically, even though one is\nsupposed to have a valid medical reason for receiving the medical marijuana\ncard - can't believe how naive I am sometimes!). I am going to wait until\nsomeone can be with me while I ingest these products, rather than taking\nthem solo. I know they're strong and I told the pharmacist that I don't want to\nbe 'frothing at the mouth' due to the THC content - lol. My hope is that they\nwill help a lot with pain management, a boost for my appetite, controlling\ninflammation  and more. We'll see.\nI put Ben on the Megabus to NY at 12;30 and know that he's already home.\nMeanwhile, I'm greatly looking forward to visits this week (I think) from Jill (my\ngrade school chum and last year's travel companion to Paris before Covid got\nher...) and her husband Fred, followed by my dear cousin, Julie. Then Ben\nreturns here Friday for two weeks! He's bringing a crew of his Brooklyn friends\nfor the full PSU football weekend experience, which probably includes\ntailgating before the game against Delaware. I look forward to meeting those\npals for Sunday brunch (just after my cousin Julie heads back to FL) and then\nto hosting Ben and Sammi for one week and just Ben for the next. Michael and\nSue have kindly invited us for dinner the first night of Rosh Hashanah. We\nwish them a speedy return to fullness of body and spirit as they've both been\nbattling....Covid!  \nPhotos",

Rather it is the result of the\nmonstrous cancer that is nothing but an abomination. I was touched, Willa, to read/hear\nyou name some of the very real life events and joys that you will miss. Who can ever\ncome to terms with that. That is simply tragic. What a beautiful day you had with Ben,\nand I love that the destination was honey for Rosh Hashanah.

I\nwish you an abundance of these moments! A big hug - M\n  \u2014Monique Yaari, September 2, 2023  \nHi Willa,\nYour writing is spectacular and I particularly enjoyed this entry. The day sounded lovely.\nCannabis- they probably told you this, but start with a very small amount of gummi. If\nyou take too much for your tolerance it goes from mild to wild and can be unpleasant. It\nalso takes awhile to take effect, 20 mins-2 hours. Maybe have some apples on hand for\nthat honey in case you get the munchies? Just testing for the holiday, right?\nXoxo\nSusan\n  \u2014Susan Israel, September 3, 2023  \nI am touched and enlightened by every one of your posts. Your honesty, unfettered and\npure, breaks through the hardened walls of my heart, opening it up to the light it so\nneeds.\nI am honored to receive your many gifts in the form of posts.. Thank you.\n  \u2014Phoebe Busges, September 3, 2023  \nThank you for the clear thoughts about a terrible situation. I hear you an am touched.\n  \u2014Denise Reiss, September 3, 2023  \nMonique speaks for me, too. As well as her beautiful, memorable wishes for an\nabundance of those precious moments! XO\n  \u2014Marianne Freed, September 3, 2023  \nI am glad that your days are often filled with sunshine and happy doing-s.\nI also love Georgian food. When Robert helped me with Gerry for 6 years, he got\nhomesick for his native cuisine and treated us to his homemade specialties, often\ninvolving walnuts.\nI found CBD oil, recommended by an MD, helpful in relieving spinal pain and used it for\nover 2 years. I still take the smallest amount at night which helps provide\n                    \na deep sleep. Good luck with your latest experiment.\n  \u2014Marlene Green, September 10, 2023  \nDear Willa, just thinking of you - hi!

    "entry": "Dear friends, Profound apologies for my long silence. I am alive! I\u2019ve had a near constant\nstream of out of town visitors for the past month, which means both that I have much to\nrecount (all were wonderful visits) and that I am strapped for writing time. Further, I\u2019m\nfeeling increasingly fatigued and unfortunately overcome by inertia at times. Finally, in\nthis stage of waning, I feel myself turning inwards, introspectively, almost cosmically. I\ndo want to write you, though, and have much to share. My brother, Ethan, is kindly\nvisiting me now. On Thursday, I am mustering whatever energy I can, and we\u2019ll travel to\nNew York for a few days so I can spend time with beloved family and a few beloved\nfriends. Back in State College on October 3rd with help from my driver (yes, I have a\ndriver now!). with my mother in tow. I will try to write again from the city. I hope this\nfinds you well. I hope you weren\u2019t worried about me. Thanks for your well wishes and\ncontinued concern. Much love.  \nSent from CaringBridge iPhone app",

Meanwhile,\none thing that might really comfort Willa would be to have a massage therapist who can\ngive her gentle massages, even just food or hand massages - anything to try to bring\nmore physical relaxation and ease. Soothing touch might be helpful to her in this stage. I\nsuggested this when I saw her a few days ago and she said she would like to try. If one of\nher friends in State College could find someone local it might be a source of comfort?\n  \u2014Shanny Peer, October 9, 2023  \nI would recommend Doris Rogalla who is amazing--she's at the Center for Well\nBeing cwbmassagetherapy@gmail.com tel 814.237.3042\n  \u2014Heather Bryant, October 9, 2023  \nDear Ben - sending love to Willa, thank you so much to you and Ethan for the updates\nand all you are doing\n  \u2014Holley Atkinson, October 9, 2023  \nMore love and concern for Willa\n  \u2014Amanda Saxon, October 9, 2023  \nSo sorry to hear about Willa's decline.

Both a closure and an opening of a\nwindow onto our shared passion for research. Historians love to solve mysteries, find\nburied treasure. That urge never dies.\nVincent suddenly realized that in his archive xeroxes (out at the little house), a name in\nthe lists at the Paris Opera of those allowed backstage in the 1870's -- not as easy a\nprivilege to get as Degas makes us think -- there was a name he could never quite figure\nout: a mysterious \"Yver.\" Who dat? No genealogical research ever panned out. Tonight\nthe lightbulb hit when he got home: that person must, has to be, Vever!!! We've found\nhim! Vincent will go out to La Roche this weekend to pluck at his files, and then soon will\nhead out to the Archives Nationales and replunge into those hefty boxes of documents.\nHe will be able to catch every day our Henri pushed his way ahead of the eager stage-\ndoor-johnnies. We will keep your flame alight.\n  \u2014Christina von Koehler, October 12, 2023  \n  \nAn Update on Willa",

    "entry": "Hi everyone,\n \nBen here again. I am back in State College, where I\u2019ll spend the immediate future with my mom. Thank\nyou sincerely to everyone that offered and provided support this week to fill in the gaps while we work\nto establish full time care (more on that soon). A small army of close friends stayed around the clock\nproviding critical care and support. And to those that reached out, rest assured the warm wishes and\ngift are received, appreciated, and will continue to be \u2014 even if they are not responded to.\n \nHere\u2019s the sobering health update since I last wrote: My mom has experienced significant physical and\nmental decline in the past week. Primarily, she is encountering accelerations in existing symptoms:\npain in her mid-region, fatigue, limited appetite, challenges navigating the home. Due partially to a\nsteady cocktail of morphine and oxycodone, mental fatigue has also accelerated; she is quite\ndisoriented. I want to stress this is a very fluid situation, and each day is a bit different.\n                    \n \nWe have also been working quite hard to establish some semblance of full time professional care. The\nreality of evolving needs, a labor shortage, and non-abundant resources in State College have made\nthis quite difficult. Currently, Willa has a care aid 10 AM - 3 PM Monday through Friday. By the end of\nthe week, we hope to have the evening shift covered as well. A hospice nurse will come three times a\nweek to provide critical nursing care. We appreciate the many offers of help from friends to spend a\nnight. However, this week of substantial help from her friends further identified that at this point she\nneeds professional care. \n \nMany thanks as well to those that have reached out to my mom and me to schedule a visit during the\nday. I know how much you would like to see her. I will work this week to respond and schedule some\ntime, but any socializing is quite taxing for her, so it needs to be spread out. Texts to her are likely to\nbe received but unlikely to be responded to at this time. Thanks for your understanding.\n \nI will try to provide another update in the coming days. My contact is below.\n \nBen\n814-321-4059\nbjb5591@gmail.com",

Thinking of her and the family so much. Please let her know, if possible. \n  \u2014Jessica Karp, October 15, 2023  \nBen, you have shown such courage and strength. In some sense, Im sure its felt as if its\nthe least you can do (support your mom as shes dealt with cancer). Or perhaps that it\njust hasnt been a choice. From the outside, I can say that not all young men could do\nwhat you are doing (and have done). Its such a mitzvah that your mom appreciates fully\nand sees the details. And i just want to say that i think of you and what you have seen\nabd what tou are going through. Im so glad Sammi supports you so fully. Sending a\nvirtual hug. I was a classmate of your mom\u2019s at Harvard, and my husband and i have one\nchild (a dau who is at college). Your mom is always so supportive of me and my\nparenting. I wanted to reach out to you and tell you how I can only imagine its been so\nhard (and sometimes wonderful) to be a part if your mom\u2019s cancer journey.\n  \u2014Andrew Compaine, October 15, 2023  \nDearest Ben, indeed you have always been a precious gift in your mom's life (which I\nhave seen since first meeting you when you were 6 months old!\ufffd\ufffd). You've grown into an\nexceptionally fine young man who's been remarkable about rising to the occasion -- not\nonly in providing Willa with capable, comforting care but also in showing bottomless love\nand devotion. Your mom, along with your dad, nourished those beautiful traits in you\nfrom the start. Sending love, affection & warmest wishes -- Cousin Julie \u2764\n  \u2014Julie Eagle-Cardo, October 15, 2023  \n                    \nBen\nWilla and I promised to get together whenever she was in town to visit, when you lived in\nDC. I sincerely regret not having made the time to connect. Reading your update of the\ncurrent status of your mom, is at once touching and admirable to see how deftly you are\nhandling this particular challenge in her dwindling health journey. Willa is one of a kind,\nand a very strong woman. I wish for you and she, peace and strength as you navigate\nthis next stage together: you as a caregiver, and she, the recipient. Shalom\ufffd\ufffd\ufe0f\n  \u2014Ekoke Tambe, October 15, 2023  \nThank you so much for contacting us, Ben, in such a gentle and caring way.

She is an amazing woman and as\nthey say the apple does not seem to have fallen far from the tree. I don't know of too\nmany sons that would have taken such good care and shown such dedication to their\nmother as you. Please let your mom know that I had a lovely dream last night about\nbeing in her wedding. Just before I woke I was running around trying to find my shoe and\na lipstick!

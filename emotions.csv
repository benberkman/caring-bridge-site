0,"Dear friends and family, Thank you so much for the outpouring of love and support since
I had my 13 hour 'debulking' surgery for ovarian cancer at Johns Hopkins Medical Center,
where I received extraordinary care, on 8 May; I am so very grateful. Because you are all
so kind as to write, text and call me, and because I don't always have the stamina to
write individual responses, I am experimenting with this website, which will allow me to
provide some collective updates when I can't write individual notes. If you would like to
be removed from this list, please let me know. Also please feel free to *not* read any of
these updates!
I am coming along, feeling slightly more energetic, better appetite etc. and am able to
take walks in the nice weather. I still have a lot of pain in my core. I will return to Hopkins
next Tuesday for evaluations, especially concerning my stomach drainage tubes. I will
not be able to begin chemotherapy until the issue with fluid in my stomach, which the
doctors detected at the end of my stay, is resolved. Fingers crossed.
My mother returned to NY this morning but will meet me in Baltimore next week. And
Ben, who has my car in DC, will drive me back to State College next Thursday. Again, I
can't stress how generous and kind everyone has been as I try to direct my 'creativity'
towards helping regenerate my body and health. Love, Willa",3,joy,0.90459085,0.0047698566,0.0017630811,0.0010808016,0.90459085,0.049570244,0.010345402,0.027879752
1,"Thanks fo my very dear friend, Gay Morelli, today I realized a small goal I had set for
myself in the hospital: to sit beside one of the many enchanting streams in Happy Valley.
We headed for Fisherman's Paradise, a world-famous site for fly fishing, and spent two
hours lunching (1/4 of an egg salad sandwich, some cheddar cheese and some fresh
strawberries for me, which thankfully agreed with me), chatting, walking a little bit, and
enjoying the gorgeous weather. The babbling sounds of Spring Creek were very calming,
the air was fragrant, the sun warm and we saw some ebony jewelled (?) dragonflies
dancing with one another! Anyone who knows me well knows that dragonflies are one of
my personal emblems. I even had energy after that to go to Meyer Dairy for a delicious
coffee malted, most of which I saved. I was pretty exhausted when I returned a lay down
for a while before another kind friend brought over some groceries.
My surgery was one month ago. My surgeon, Dr. Anna Beavis, compared it to 'being hit
by a Mack truck and then being rolled over again the other way.' I still have a lot of pain
in my core. I have a bit more stamina and energy but get very tired by evening. My
appetite is improved.
Photo of me at Spring Creek today. I'm trying to keep up my appearance as much as
possible; it helps me.",3,joy,0.9711697,0.0011692764,0.001764799,0.00046817906,0.9711697,0.017355178,0.0039058935,0.004166975
2,"I may have tired myself out a bit from my outing yesterday, but I took a rest this
afternoon and felt better. I'm likely feeling a bit anxious about the upcoming trip to
Baltimore on Tuesday, with three days of appointments at Hopkins, CT scans, meetings
with my surgeon and liver surgeon etc. I hope I have the stamina for all of it. My mother
will be kindly joining me there. The best outcome would be to have my stomach drains
removed on the last day. We'll see.
Rabbi Ostrich nicely paid me a visit and we sat outside near my rosebush, in the sun.
Among other topics, we talked about the possibility of my learning something/s from this
difficult part of my journey (which is not the same as the 'everything happens for a
reason' idea, which I don't ascribe to at all). We also talked about a teaching I find
meaningful, from Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (an 18th/19th c. Hasidic rabbi): ""The entire
world is a narrow bridge. The most important thing is not to fear."" There are widely
varying degrees of peril or 'fraugthness' in many of our undertakings; the important
thing is not to look down when you're on that bridge and to stay focused on what needs
to be done.
I'll have company at dinner and overnight tonight (more kind friends). I also enjoyed
watching the exciting men's final at the French Open this morning!",2,fear,0.96980387,0.0019655554,0.000782011,0.96980387,0.009967771,0.010062906,0.00574419,0.0016738015
3,"Hello from Baltimore. My surgeon said I’m progressing ‘well,’ but my abdominal CT scan
revealed that the drains were no longer well positioned to drain the pocket of fluid that
needs to resolve before I can start chemo. So today I’m having a procedure to reposition
the drains. And then two more weeks of draining and antibiotics, and then back to
Hopkins in two weeks for another CT scan and drain check. Hopefully they’ll come out
then. This puts me ‘behind’ for the start of chemo, but fortunately the CT scan did not
reveal any new tumors. Thanks, everyone, for your well wishes. These ‘blips’ are not
uncommon. Patience is proving a virtue.

4,"Back in State College. The drain repositioning went well, and I have returned home with
only one stomach drain, which makes a difference psychologically in terms of the time I
spend flushing and draining the drainage bags. My surgeon also eliminated two of my
daily medications plus a daily injection I was giving myself to prevent clotting. So that is
good. Of course, many new medications will be added when I start chemo.
I also met briefly with the liver surgeon who performed part of my operation, Dr. William
Reece Burns, who thought everything looked fine. I can't praise the medical personnel at
Hopkins highly enough; they are superbly skilled, sensitive to patients, thorough,
responsive (via email, phone etc.). I feel so fortunate to be treated there. The surgeon
who performed my 13 hour operation, Dr. Anna Beavis, must be out slaying dragons in
                         
her spare time. She totally rocks.
I have to return to Hopkins June 25-27, hopefully to have the drains removed. This is
always a bit of a logistical challenge as I don't feel comfortable driving that distance due
to the medications I'm taking, but I will figure out a solution.
My mother, who was a super trooper while she was with me in Baltimore, returned to
New York by train and Ben (who had my car in DC) picked me up and drove us home,
where he'll stay until he leaves for a business trip on Saturday. Of course I was thrilled to
have three hours of car time with my son, and some time here as well. In what must be a
good sign, I convinced Ben to let me take him to Alvaro's, the fabulous old-school Italian
bake shop/restaurant in Harrisburg that is always my midway stopping point when I'm
driving to DC. Ben had a delicious chicken parm sandwich on homemade Italian bread.
My appetite is much diminished, but I did enjoy about 1/4 of a meatball sandwich, and
we shared a homemade gelato (burnt almond/pistachio). With my digestive tract
'rewired,' I'm nowhere near my normal levels of 'foodiness,' but hopefully I'll get back
there at some future point.
Thanks, everyone, for all the texts, messages, emails. Sooo appreciated. Big love,",3,joy,0.7264018,0.0028268027,0.004722436,0.0038045975,0.7264018,0.22337574,0.015404413,0.023464255
5,"Not too much to report. It was wonderful having Ben here for a few days (he's gone back
to DC now); his presence was immensely comforting and he helped me with shopping,
cleaning and other chores around the house. We also took a few walks and I was able to
walk further than I had previously. I had my final visits with the PT and visiting nurse, so I
am pretty much 'solo' right now, while many kind friends continue to bring meals,
flowers, and themselves as visitors. I think I'm managing ok, although I can start feeling
overwhelmed quickly. I have to try to stay 'on task' with exercises and walks, staying
ultra-hydrated etc. I did take a long nap this afternoon, though. My body likely needs
                        
that time to heal. Thank you, everyone, for the recent texts, emails and msgs.",5,sadness,0.81125855,0.0043075085,0.0009516474,0.0843038,0.01597956,0.01132976,0.81125855,0.07186914
6,"I have been 'solo' for a few days now, and am feeling a bit mixed about it. It's very
peaceful, and I've been sleeping a lot, both at night and in the afternoon. I guess my
body needs the rest. I'm finding it a bit hard to get motivated to do things, even take a
shower. I can't tell whether I'm depressed or just tired -- or both. A few friends have
come by to visit and that has lifted my spirits.
I'm feeling some tightening in my core, which I think may be muscle and tissue getting
stronger. At least I hope that's what it is. It is easier for me to walk than it was previously
- I twice walked ten long laps of my house today without much difficulty.
                        
I am getting connected to a network at Hopkins that pairs survivors with those going
through treatment, like me. I hope that will be helpful. I've also looked into a support
network here for women dealing with gyn cancers, run by one of my neighbors/fellow JCC
congregants. I realized that I recognized one name already on the list of members. Not
feeling too alone while on the 'narrow bridge' will, I think, be key for me.
Thanks, everyone, for the texts and emails, yummy food and other acts of caring and
kindness. XO",5,sadness,0.4743872,0.0037757684,0.0074101514,0.016195742,0.38640678,0.104049094,0.4743872,0.007775242
7,"Today I had a consultation with Dr. Hegstrom, the surgeon who will place a port in my
chest through which I'll receive chemo and fluids. While I'm assured by others that this is
a fairly simple outpatient procedure -- it takes about fifteen minutes and I'll be lightly
sedated -- the list of potential risks (eg a lung collapsing) is always scary to hear. If all
goes as planned, the port will be inserted on 1 July. While Dr. Hegstrom also expressed
some concern about my stomach infection not being resolved, which might in turn
impact the port placement, in the end he seemed to feel fairly confident (by looking at
the fluid in my drainage bag) that my remaining stomach drain would indeed be
removed next week. Let's hope so.
As the scale revealed that I've lost 10-15 pounds since surgery, and to take the edge off
the visit with the surgeon, I treated myself to a small Dairy Queen cone after the
appointment.
My wonderful friend Maria came over for tea and a good chat. Then my equally
wonderful friend Monique came by with a yummy and nutritious looking dinner of tilapia,
zucchini and potatoes, which I look forward to trying soon. The visits from friends are so
uplifting and so essential to my recovery.
A college friend who had just heard about my health situation from another classmate
wrote to tell me that she had learned that I was ""very ill."" This made me wonder if I am,
in fact, very ill. While ovarian cancer can be notoriously aggressive, I am preferring to
focus on the fact that I came out of major surgery very well (aside from the hopefully
soon to be resolved stomach drain issue), that I am moving forward to the next stage of
my treatment, and that I am receiving superb medical care from doctors fully committed
to giving me the best possible shot at a good recovery. Also: I'm a trooper.
My core has been feeling stronger the past two days. As a result, I feel less winded, can
stand taller because my ribs and diaphragm are not aching as much, and can walk with
more stamina. I hope this trend continues.",2,fear,0.90121925,0.002082921,0.002858149,0.90121925,0.035320956,0.040482044,0.009879598,0.008157102
8,"Not much new to report. Via UPS this morning I received a well chilled supply of
Neulasta, a drug that I will be taking after each chemo treatment to help me regenerate
white blood cells. I've also continued to start getting plugged into various support
groups/networks, one an online support group run by cancercare.org, the other a
'mentorship' program run by Hopkins. Today I was paired with my 'mentor,' a survivor
who lives in the Lewistown area, ie not far from State College. I hope to speak with her
soon.
As mentioned, my core continues to feel a bit stronger but I feel that I must push myself
harder to take walks, exercise etc. Not always that easy when I'm solo, as I'm not really
supposed to walk unaccompanied. Tomorrow, though, I am hoping to spend some time
with my friend Maria at the Penn State Arboretum, where we'll surely stroll through the
beautiful gardens.
But I did push myself to get to services tonight, and I'm glad I did. I was able to get rides
there and back. It was nice to be with my Jewish community and to see several people
who know about my health challenges and who have been expressing concern in writing
but not yet in person. I am not quite sure who in my congregation knows and that is
slightly awkward, but it's also ok. The congregation is another source of comfort, caring
and 'uplift,' and some of the prayers are as well. The line that always resonates with me,
from the prayer for a peaceful sabbath night is: ""May you walk with good companions."" I
                        
most certainly do, and am most grateful for that.",3,joy,0.8508481,0.002030095,0.0028673476,0.0075988914,0.8508481,0.09993648,0.023677781,0.013041287
9,"Grateful to several friends who provided cheer today. My friend Maria and I enjoyed
strolling and chatting in the beautiful Penn State arboretum on a perfect June day. It's a
gorgeous spot, and a real asset to our campus and town. We loved admiring the many
different types of flowers, plants and trees in magnificent summer bloom and also
cheered on a bride processing to her ceremony under a big tent in the arboretum. See
pics below. Having lost about 15 lbs (but yes, what a way to lose weight...) and feeling
increasingly stronger post-surgery, I'm probably wanting to preserve this image of me for
later visualization, as I'm sure I won't look this way once chemo starts. Sigh.
My dear friends/colleagues Kathryn and John not only cooked me dinner -- delicious
steaks from a new butcher in town, grilled to perfection -- but also shared the meal with
me so we could catch up after not having seen one another in a while. It was lovely to
spend time with them.

10,"I am headed back to Hopkins tomorrow for more procedures -CT scan and (pending a
good result of that and hopefully!) drain removal. I am a bit apprehensive about making
                        
the trip solo, but I think I'll be ok as I am no longer feeling overwhelmed by small things,
as I was in the hospital and for the first two weeks at home. When I realized today that I
must have an adult with me to escort me out of the PACU following the drain removal
procedure (as I'll be coming off sedation), my wonderful cousin Ilene, who lives in
Baltimore with her family (her husband, David, is my dear first cousin), very kindly said
she'd be there.
There are a lot of unknowns right now, as I expect there will be for months (years?) to
come: will I be able to have the drain removed on Thursday? Has any cancer reemerged
in the meanwhile, as the CT scan might reveal? Can I start chemo soon (ie next week)?
How will those treatments affect me? Will I be able to handle them? Should I start
investigating options for when my hair will (likely) fall out? Well, I'll try not to get too far
ahead of myself.
Lovely visits and kind gestures from friends Chris, Helen and Albert warmed my spirits. A
kind neighbor came by with a book of short inspirational texts for me to take to Hopkins
with me. I so appreciate the well wishes, texts, emails, and random (or actually not so
random) acts of kindness. :)",2,fear,0.92493045,0.00199706,0.000729351,0.92493045,0.005168052,0.0034847104,0.002675358,0.061015055
11,"The drain’s not coming out. While the stomach abcess has shrunk from 12 to 9 cm, it’s
still producing too much fluid (about 38 cl a day and they’d like to see 10!). W/out going
into too much detail, I was frustrated with the radiation oncologist I saw, who made the
determination about the drain, and this put me in a stressed out funk. She had not read
the report on my CT scan (which I had this morning) prior to my arrival. She said she
would consult w my surgeon, Dr. Beavis, but Dr. Beavis’ nurse had said that Dr. Beavis
would defer to radiation oncology on decisions regarding the drain. She (radiation
oncologist) said perhaps I could start chemo even without the drain pulled (as the
antibiotics I’m taking would offer additional protection) but both Dr. Beavis and Dr. Patel
(medical oncologist in State College) seemed to me adamantly opposed to this idea. She
also mentioned that I might start taking an anti-fungal medication. The first way it might
be delivered could pose risks to my heart (!!) so it would probably be delivered via port.
The CT scan report mentioned no new tumor growth; that is good. I just hope that the
best informed decision can be made regarding next steps. These will obviously include a
return trip here before long - definitely not convenient, but I’ll do whatever is necessary.

12,"I am feeling better following a long phone call w/my surgeon, Anna Beavis (who
continues to be wonderful and who explains everything very clearly and thoroughly to
me), and now knowing that Drs. Beavis, Mehta (radiation oncologist) and Patel (medical
oncologist here in State College) have now all consulted and that everyone is on the
same page. The one stomach drain will stay in for approximately 2+ weeks longer
(precisely, two weeks after I begin receiving, on Tuesday, an anti-fungal medication
called micafungin through the port that I will have placed on Monday and through which
I'll also receive chemo). The doctors hope the anti-fungal medication may help diminish
the amount of fluid my stomach abscess is producing. In any event, after about two
weeks they will make a determination about whether I should return to Hopkins for
another CT scan or whether chemo could start right away in State College. This will
depend in large part on how much drainage there is from my stomach.
I'm sure all these details are scintillating...
My wonderful friend Ruth brought 'lunch for two' from Wegman's to my house and we
had a lovely time catching up. She encouraged me to turn my disappointment about
things I'm not doing this summer, which winds up draining my energy, into a forward
hopeful look towards doing them next year. This does not mean denying the feeling of
disappointment and sadness, but not wallowing in it. I am sooo disappointed, for
example, to not be attending tomorrow the Pride Parade in Paris with my friend Randy
and often other friends, a day I look forward to all year as a celebration of diversity,
tolerance, love -- and as a simply fabulous, joyous, incredibly fun party all over Paris but
mainly in the Marais. Next year.
In the meantime, there have been the debates, the FIFA Women's World Cup (the USA
continues not to disappoint!), and lots of visits from friends. And Ben will be here
tomorrow for a visit!
                        
Oh, and I drove today for the first time since before my surgery on 8 May. It felt ok - I
drove myself to have some bloodwork done - and I'm encouraged to increase my
independence by driving more.

13,"Aside from driving, I accomplished a few more 'firsts' this weekend (since surgery): I
drove to the Saturday farmers market for the first time this summer. Anyone who knows
me well knows that, as a confirmed foodie, I love shopping at farmers markets (whether
in State College, Paris, New York or elsewhere) and cooking with whatever is fresh and
local. I also enjoy our farmers market as a social scene - it's always nice to run into
friends and neighbors and I was missing that. Fortunately, my dear friend Maria met me
at the market because it proved a slight challenge. I was fine for about half an hour but
then the heat (perhaps 85 degrees?) starting getting to me and I felt rather weak. Maria
scuttled me under a tent set up with chairs and brought me a very refreshing drink of
Pineapple Shrub from Tait Farm (a great local place) and sparkling water. After a while I
felt fine and drove home. And I did manage to nab some great looking red and golden
beets from local Amish farmers, some garlic scapes and four freshly baked donuts in
preparation for Ben's arrival later that morning.
Speaking of food, my cooking mojo may be returning. Not sure whether it's a 'one off,'
whether I like nothing better than to cook for Ben, or some other reason, but I prepared a
salad with the beets tossed with a good vinaigrette and goat cheese and also made
some tangy garlic scape pesto, which we slathered on penne. Ben cooked the mahi-
mahi. I'm still *extremely* grateful for the meals that friends are bringing me, as the
cooking did tire me out a bit and do not have the energy to do it every day, but I'm very
glad to feel motivated, for the first time since surgery, to cook some favorite summer
dishes.
Having Ben here for a short overnight visit was the best medicine. We talked, shopped,
cooked, ate, relaxed, and (re)watched Anthony Bourdain's episode shot in Lyon in
preparation for Ben and Sammi's upcoming trip there (Ben and I were supposed to go
together, but since I can't do so this summer I'm delighted to send him and his girlfriend
and to get a full report from them -- with lots of pictures).
I am anxious about having my port placed tomorrow. I hope the procedure goes well.
Between the stomach drain and the port, I expect to feel like a bionic woman by then.
I had a scare at Hopkins when, while trying to locate the infectious diseases unit, I
mistakenly stumbled into a waiting room full of cancer patients, many of whom were
wearing surgical masks, and many of whom looked to me quite ill (very thin, in
wheelchairs, bald, sickly, coughing etc.). As I feel (and look) relatively 'good' (or at least
better....) right now (and at least compared to right after surgery), I wonder if I have
lulled myself into a false sense of normalcy and complacency, trotting off to the farmers
market to schmooze with my friends. What's the line that separates me from those
cancer patients waiting to see their doctors? I have cancer too. The images made me
shudder and I needed to refocus and get back into the present and the task at hand of
                        
recovery and treatment. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...

14,"I had my port successfully placed this morning. The procedure only took about 15-30
minutes (I was completely out from the sedation), but I wound up being at the outpatient
surgical clinic from about 9 to 1:30. I'm starting to feel a bit of pain/discomfort now that
the local anesthetic is wearing off, but nothing that a dose of Percocet tonight shouldn't
be able to alleviate.
Tomorrow -- in a scenario that is making me a bit anxious but that I am hoping will also
work out fine -- a nurse will be driving to my house from Akron, OH (!!) to administer my
first dose of anti-fungal medication through my port (which will hopefully help further
clear up the stomach abscess issue) and to show *me* how to administer it after that.
The medicine is supposed to be delivered to my home between 10 and 11 tomorrow.
These are the some of the inconveniences of living in a somewhat remote area, I'm
finding: I suppose a nurse skilled at giving infusions (and working for a home health
agency) could not be found closer to me. However ""nurse Ruth"" just called me and she
sounds extremely competent and 'on task' so I will go with the flow.
...and then it will be *back* to Hopkins next week for what I'm really hoping will be a final
CT scan and drain removal. Which means I again need to try to set up rides and make
arrangements. It is not convenient but it is certainly worth it for the excellent care I am
getting.
Meanwhile, the sun is still shining on this beautiful day so I think I'll go sit outside and
finish reading an excellent _New Yorker_ article about Emmanuel Macron's presidency.

15,"The past few days have been a bit frustrating but I'm focusing on the positive. I am
having an anti-fungal medication, micafungin, delivered via my port to hopefully help
clear up my stomach abscess (so far, I have not noticed any effect on the amount of
stomach fluid I've been draining). The goal is for me to be able to administer this
medication myself, through my port (through which I'll also receive chemo), but it seems
quite daunting (many steps, but I think I'll get there). So this morning I am having a third
visiting nurse come administer the medication and offer me a third lesson in how to do
it. Nurse Ruth, who drove here from Akron, Ohio (4 hours), was good humored and very
capable, but yesterday Nurse David actually helped teach me better (both were very
nice and to a certain extent helped alleviate my anxiety, at least temporarily). Nurse
Todd will, I believe, be arriving soon. The infusion, which drips from a bag hung up on an
IV pole, takes about an hour and I have to take this med for one month. I can move
around with the pole and do other things around the house.
I am also having a hard time arranging transport to/from Baltimore (an unanticipated
problem, partly because I did not realize that I'd have to be making so many trips
there!), but my wonderful friend Sandy is going to drive me there next Wednesday for
another CT scan, consult w/Dr. Mehta (radiation oncologist) and -- again, hopefully (but
again, it may not happen) - drain removal.
I had a great talk last night with Rhonda, an ovarian/uterine cancer survivor who was
treated at Hopkins and is my 'mentor' via a Hopkins-based program called Woman to
Woman. Rhonda was very validating about my feelings, shared her own experiences and
those of other survivors, and was also super-encouraging about the current treatments
and of course the world-class medical care at Hopkins. We are the same age, both have
one son (hers a bit older) and she lives just about 25 miles from here, in Lewistown (her
husband and son both work in State College). It feels wonderful to have this 'lifeline' (and
the reinforced mantra of ""you are not alone""), along with a similar great connection with
Diane in New York (a member of my extended family and also a survivor) and likely soon
a support group in State College that is planning a picnic for August. I am so grateful.
I have been having a lot dreams about France. Of course, I'd love to be there and miss
my 'happy place.' In one dream, I was in the driver's seat of a car that I had stopped in a
dusty lot, somewhere in the US, with, above me, a maze of highways densely packed
with urban  traffic. I was trying to set my GPS to figure out how to drive to France but all
sorts of odd maps kept popping up. In another dream, I am in France and order a ""Perrier

over France. And Ben and Sammi will be heading to Paris tomorrow, and I will be
enjoying their trip to Paris and Lyon vicariously. I can feel my own travel bug restless
within me and am already dreaming up some new trips - hopefully.
Grateful to friends John, Sandy and Ron, and Clare for recent visits, delicious food
(posole, flan, couscous, chilled asparagus soup!) and good cheer.
Warm thanks to friends who have written emails recently. I *will* write back soon! In
fact, I am in the midst of answering each of them, but want to give each the attention it

grateful for, acts of kindness.
My sweet cousin, Raphael Noah Eagle, along with his dad, my dear first
cousin David Eagle, will soon be participating in a 90 mile bike race to raise
money for Friendship Circle, an organization that works to end the
loneliness of children and adults with disabilities (you can read David's
description below). Raphael and David are kindly making me the 'honoree'
of their race! I couldn't be more touched. Thank you, Team Eagle. And so
glad to know too that you are nearby in Baltimore, where it turns out I'm
now a frequent visitor.
Dear Friends and Family,
 
On July 18, G-d willing, Raphael Noah and I will be joining dozens of cyclists to undertake a challenging 90-mile ride in
support of Friendship Circle.  Friendship Circle is an amazing organization whose mission is to end loneliness for special
                        
needs children and adults through a variety of programs.  I just heard that they sponsored and accompanied 22 young
men and women with special needs on a trip to Israel, none of whom had ever traveled before without their parents.  True
""chesed"" (kindness)!
 
I don't know if I will be able to complete the 90 miles in the heat of July, but I am planning to have a blast with Raphael
and our cycling buddies in support of a worthy cause.  This year we are dedicating our ride to our courageous cousin Willa
Silverman, who is determined to overcome the health challenges she is currently facing.  Raphael has added a nice note
and photo of Willa on his fundraising page (see link below).
 
The Talmud says that ""charity hastens the redemption,"" which means both the universal redemption when the world will
leave in peace as well as our own personal redemptions that we all strive to achieve.  If you feel inclined to make a
charitable donation toward Raphael's gutsy ride for a very good cause, please click on this link:

17,"There is not much new to report. I am focused on my upcoming trip to
Hopkins on Wednesday-Thursday and hope that my CT scan will provide
evidence that my stomach drain can be removed; I guess I have to prepare
for the possibility that it won't be, though.This really is a marathon - yeesh.
Cheered that my friend Sandy will kindly accompany/drive me to/from
Baltimore. We'll both have rooms in the Residence Inn near the Hopkins
Medical Center (lots of out of town patients stay there, and the staff is very
nice), which has a lovely rooftop restaurant with panoramic views of the
city.
Nurse Todd came over today to change the needle in my port; this needs to
be done once a week. He also gave me a refresher in how to administer my
micafungin infusion as my previous two solo attempts resulted in either the
medicine and/or my blood spurting out of the tubing, which was stressful to
witness. Today I managed to do everything correctly, but after the medicine
had finished dripping I waited too long to proceed to the next step (flushing
my tubing with saline and then an anti-clotting med) as I was enjoying a
visit with my friend Maria, and my tubing (which I had forgot to clamp once
the medicine finished dripping) again filled with some blood. Oy. I think
tomorrow will be a charm. Then I'll need to throw two days worth of the med
                        
-- which I'm expecting to arrive tomorrow via UPS as part of my next weekly
delivery -- on cold packs for transport to Baltimore, along with my i.v. pole,
so that I can administer the med when I'm there. Nothing in life is simple :(
Tomorrow is the second anniversary of my father's death from lung cancer
and other ailments and of course I'll be thinking of him (and unless I'm
unable I'll also observe his yartzheit at synagogue on shabbat a bit later this
month). While it's awful for any parent to witness a child experience a
serious illness, I think it would have been particularly hard on my father in
his extreme ill health. My mother, thankfully, has a tremendous amount of
fortitude, is very pragmatic, and as a cancer survivor herself understands
well certain aspects of my treatment. She's been a great comfort to me.
Aside from a lovely visit with Maria, I enjoyed breakfast out at a local bagel
place with my friend Gay. After sitting for a while, my abdomen starts to feel
uncomfortable, but I was still grateful for the simple pleasure (and frequent
ritual) of having breakfast and catch-up with a close friend.
My college classmate and friend Josh sent me some koans familiar to him
from his martial arts practice. Per Wikipedia (!), a koan is ""a story, dialogue,
question, or statement which is used in Zen practice to provoke the 'great doubt' and to
practice or test a student's progress in Zen."" There is also sometimes an element of
paradox in koans.
Face hard times with an unshakable spirit.
Be patient with yourself and with others.
Keep a strong center.
Be grateful for each moment.
If you fall seven times, get up eight times.
Another koan Josh sent asks the question of which is stronger, a steel rod or a
bamboo stalk? Answer: the bamboo stalk, as it is more flexible and can adapt or bend
as situations require.
I think I may need, among other elements including continued excellent medical care,
both the perseverance of the Zen master and the gutsy badassery of a Megan Rapinoe
                        
to meet the challenges ahead.

18,"If all goes as planned, my remaining stomach drain will be removed tomorrow morning.
The CT scan of my abdomen, which I had taken this morning, revealed that the abscess
has again shrunk in size. It is not completely resolved, so I’ll continue to take two strong
antibiotics and the antifungal med for a few more weeks at least. But the radiation
oncologist, Dr. Mehta, thinks chemo should not be delayed further, even if there’s a risk
that the stomach infection could still interfere with the chemo (causing it to be
interrupted or even necessitating placement of another stomach drain). There is so much
uncertainty in this cancer journey, ie the ‘narrow bridge’ that I wrote about in another
post. I’m hoping and presuming that my other doctors will be on board with this plan.
No signs of new visible cancer in this particular CT scan - good news.
I’ll have to return to Hopkins in a few weeks for follow up.
So my chemo could begin quite soon, as early as next week.
I asked the doctor if I could have a celebratory glass of wine tonight but she advised that
it interacts badly with Flagyl and would make me feel sick. I haven’t had a drop of
alcohol since early May and it looks like I’ll need to wait longer to enjoy a glass of wine or
                        
a cocktail. It’s ok. My friend Sandy, who very kindly accompanied me on this trip, and I
will enjoy a nice dinner in the hotel’s rooftop restaurant. And I’m vicariously enjoying Ben
and Sammi’s food and wine adventures in the Lyonnais!

19,"Back from the quick overnight trip to Baltimore. Had another CT scan of my abdomen (I
am almost used to the yucky tasting 'drink' ingested before the procedure, but still could
not help spitting up afterwards the contrast dye injected into me, which filled my mouth
with a metallic salty taste and my body with a warm and unpleasant rush). Then I met
with Dr. Mehta, the radiation oncologist, who said that although the stomach abscess has
not completely resolved (it has shrunk by about half and is producing less fluid than
before), she felt that the better plan at this point would be to remove the stomach drain,
keep me on two strong antibiotics and an anti-fungal for 4-6 more weeks, and proceed to
chemo. Of course, the risk still remains that the infection could rear its head during
chemo, causing the chemo to 'blow up' (as Dr. Patel said), and in turn necessitating a
temporary stoppage of chemo and/or reinsertion of stomach drain. I will need to ask
what the chances of this are. I certainly hope it doesn't happen. The risk of waiting for
the infection to resolve further would be the possibility of new tumors forming. All my
                        
doctors are on board with the new plan.
As mentioned, though, little is straightforward in this journey. When I arrived the next
morning to have the stomach drain removed by in the interventional radiologists, the
doctors balked, saying that my stomach was still producing too much fluid and that they
did not recommend removing the drain. Needless to say, this threw me into a panic, as
this was my *third* trip to Hopkins in the hopes of having the drain removed. Only some
eleventh-hour discussions between those doctors and Dr. Mehta resulted in all the
doctors getting on the same page about drain removal. But of course this again made
me feel shaky about the decision to remove the drain, given the initial disagreement
among the doctors. It is hard for me to sit with this type of anxiety and uncertainty,
when I am really trusting the doctors to make the best decisions. In any event, the
stomach drain was removed -- to my surprise, I was not sedated and the PA simply
pulled the tube out of my stomach (uncomfortable, a bit painful, but not excruciating...).
I believe my chemo will start next Thursday, here in State College. Of course, I am
anxious (a recurrent word in this entry, I see..) and will focus on preparing myself
physically and mentally this coming week, while also getting out in the nice weather and
having some fun.
In a beautiful act of friendship, my friend Sandy traveled with me to Baltimore and back.
As paradoxical as it may seem given the circumstances, we actually had a a great time
on our road trip, and shared many laughs -- whether over the deafening din in the hotel's
rooftop restaurant, where the horrible acoustics made the rather pathetic musician
playing his guitar in a remote corner of the room sound like he was playing a sitar; or
over our somewhat madcap multi-hour interlude getting repeatedly lost in Harrisburg
trying to get to Alvaro's bake shop (closed), Little Amps coffee house (struck out trying to
find it at both addresses), and finally winding up at ""The Sandwich Man"" (see pic) in
Paxtonia, PA, for tuna sandwiches. Felt like Groundhog Day as we kept crisscrossing the
same highways and retracing our steps! In another central PA moment, a billboard at the
edge of Harrisburg raised the question of whether those reading it were going to heaven
or hell. Maybe I should call the number to find out? In any event, ""cancer is hilarious"" --
occasionally. A virtual prize to anyone who knows in what t.v. series that line is
pronounced.
In another beautiful act of friendship, my dear friend and college roommate Denise Reiss
and her husband Mike came to visit me briefly at the hotel and accompanied me to my
procedure! It was wonderful to see them and Denise has always gone out of her way to
be in touch with her friends when they are facing challenges. I wish we could have spent
more time visiting but I hope I'll get to see them in NY or PA before long.
Thanks too to my friend John who kindly drove me to his in-laws' farm the other day and
set up a lawn chair for me right by Slab Cabin Creek that runs through the backyard of
                        
the property. Sipping a big glass of ice cold lemonade (which John also provided), I
enjoyed a pleasant few hours reading in this idyllic spot, with ducks, roosters, dogs and a
horse completing the tableau.
Ben and Sammi, seen here wine-tasting in the Beaujolais, are at the end of a wonderful
trip to France, ending with a few days in Annecy. I'm so glad that they were able to take
this trip in my absence. This is great motivation for me to get back to France!

20,"With chemo starting on Thursday, I find myself thinking about how my appearance may
change, especially with the predicted loss of my hair, possible changes in skin tone, and
weight gain or loss. Without wanting to seem vain (but I likely am a bit, but hopefully not
egregiously...), I've always prided myself on my appearance, and -- as many know -- am
all about the clothes, jewelry, makeup and accessories procured near and far that over
the years I've worked into a personal style. I love creating and accessorizing outfits that
suit my mood for the day, occasion or season. I am anxious that the loss of this part of
my identity will depress me. As various friends have pointed out, though, normally this
will be a temporary, reversible situation and I'll still get to inject a bit of signature style
into my look or experiment with new styles (I'll just need to find the right scarves and
hats to rock; I saw some cute ones on Etsy, made from kimono fabric). And *of course* I
realize that losing my hair is a small price to pay to zap those cancer cells. As my dear
grad school friend Vinni and I discussed by phone today, chemo is the crucial next step
in the healing process, as debilitating as it may be. I am grateful to my mother for
coming to State College on Wednesday to see me through the first chemo cycle. She's
been down that road too.
But that song from _Rent,_ though, that's been going through my mind recently. It's
haunting:

It is difficult to know what to say to someone with cancer. For me, what proves helpful
are encouraging words, positivity re outcome, or simply 'holding space' for whatever
thoughts or emotions I may be feeling or wish to express. What proves less helpful, again
for me, are questions about prognosis, expressions of worry over my being 'very ill,' and
mention in list form of women who died young of ovarian cancer. I don't intend to sound
prescriptive, or dictate how people should react to me, and I also have to not be so rigid
as to deny people their own feelings, but I am learning what my triggers are around my
health situation.
Random (and not random!) gestures of kindness are so uplifting and healing -- there
continue to be many of them from all of you (I thank you for even reading my blog, a
kind gesture, and thank everyone for the texts, emails, cards etc.!). My cherished group
of grad school friends (""les filles"") sent me a care package that will enable me to read,
watch, listen and doodle my way through the next few months. My college friend Richard
sent me a short video of him and other friends playing the Fleetwood Mac song
""Songbird"" because he knew I liked it. And walks around the arts fest with several friends
this weekend were lots of fun. I bought a very pretty 'cigar band' type ring with an opal
in the middle (see pics - I always wear purple nail polish at least once at the height of
summer) and a pretty hamsa, the protective hand that one sees all over the Middle East
                        
and that is reputed to bring good luck, happiness, good fortune and health. I always wear
one when I travel and now I will wear this new one through the upcoming weeks. I should
scarcely be buying stuff for myself right now but well.... I couldn't resist.

21,"My love of both Art nouveau and Japanese art attracted me to dragonflies. In Art
nouveau, dragonflies often boast a distinctly human and female body, as in Lalique's
spectacular ""Dragonfly Woman Corsage"" brooch, shown to great success at the 1900
World's Fair. They are symbols of the beauty of the natural world (and of women's
relation to it, from the perspective of these creators), but also of transformation and
rebirth -- the dragonfly emerging from her cocoon. You'll find representations of
dragonflies all over my house. So as I head to chemo tomorrow and think about both the
power of my body to regenerate (more white blood cells, hopefully, and fewer cancer
cells) and the persistence of beauty in the world, I was delighted to receive two
dragonfly-themed gifts! My father's longtime partner, Jane, who knows all about me and
dragonflies, sent me a lovely tote bag (pic above) that I'll pack with my iPad (Kindle), ear
buds, hand and face creams, snacks and water as I head to my first round of chemo
tomorrow morning. My friend/colleague, Bénédicte, brought the right touch of bling with
a beautiful dragonfly pin. Vive les libellules!
Among the many descriptions of the experience and effects of chemo that have been
shared with me, the most striking (lyrical? humorous? affecting? real?) was that provided
by Richard, my beloved professor, dissertation director and mentor (whom I've known
since I was an eighteen-year-old freshman at Harvard in 1977), who has just finished
cancer treatment himself. Here's what he wrote me: ""Chemo will be like this weird brief love
affair, with its periodic “trysts” as you are infused in the hospital.  All the steroids they give you for the
first days will make you feel oddly enhanced, and then you will slope into this weird, mushy place
after a day or two, semi-stunned and nauseous. "" I was of course enthused by the initial
comparison of receiving chemo to a love affair and trysts, but then it became clear that
we may be talking about (in Gaga's terms) a ""bad romance."" ""Semi-stunned and
nauseous"" seems far less appealing, along with Richard's warning that ""everything you
eat tastes like shit."" So I've loaded up the fridge with yogurt and almond milk for
smoothies, come what may. One day at a time.
                        
I've also been reading some Jewish prayers for beginning chemotherapy (although I
understand that my cells may well have a mind of their own and that the 'power of
prayer' in my mind is simply akin to a positive and hopeful attitude). This one features
the protective imagery, from both the Torah and Kabbalistic mythology, of angels. I also
like the thought of compassion for the caregivers, as well as self-compassion:
“I sit here and I wait, while the medicine drips into my body. I am afraid, and
I am hopeful. May the medicine that has the power to heal or destroy be
gentle within me. Give me strength over the next few days, weeks and
months to endure the effects of the drugs and illness. While this disease is
part of my body, help me to feel powerful and in control of how I live my life.
“Give me compassion for my doctors, nurses, carers and most of all for my
own body. May I know that I am encircled by Your love. May the ancient
spirit of the angels Michael, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael bring me a sense of
Your presence, strength, a light at the end of the tunnel, healing and hope.”
Going to lunch with my friends Mar and Jessi at the Corner Room downtown
then will head to pick up my mother at the Megabus station.

23,"Today, with my first round of chemo completed, my treatment really feels like a full-time
job. I didn't sleep too well because of the five steroid pills that I took last night to combat
nausea; they ramped me up. I had a classic work anxiety dream: I was on a dissertation
committee but had not read the full dissertation and was racing around frantically trying
to finish up some tasks and/or figure out how I was going to deal with my lack of
preparedness. I could see the numerous other members of the committee assembled
and looking primed to begin the defense. I won't venture an interpretation here but work
is never far from my thoughts if sadly less present in my actions right now...
My friend Clare drove my mother and me to Dr. Patel's office at 8 a.m. I had blood drawn
and then met with Dr. Patel for about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, my white blood count
was lower than he would have liked, which is somewhat concerning as I need those
fighting cells! As a result, he decided to proceed but to give me a slightly lower dosage
of the chemo medications. Calculated risks are often the name of the game in this
process... I was in a room with comfy recliners and other 'amenities' - blankets, pillows,
snacks and water, t.v., magazines, a basket of knitted chemo caps for the taking. No
windows, though, unfortunately. There might have been about five or six other patients
receiving treatment at the same time as me, and three or four nurses were always on
call. The nurse who attended to me during the day was extremely kind and experienced.
First, I had to have three 'pre-chemo' meds administered through my port to counteract
nausea and a possible allergic reaction; this took about an hour and a half. Then, after a
short break, I had the chemo meds administered, also via my port: Taxol (three hours)
and Carbo (.5 hours). I felt fine during all of this. While the Carbo was being
administered, the nurse affixed a patch containing Neulasta to my left arm; it will
activate after 27 hours (ie at about 7:00 p.m. tomorrow, when I am hoping to be at
synagogue to observe my father's yarzeit - we'll see). The Neulasta helps regenerate
white blood cells; the downside is that it can also cause bone pain, so I will take a Claritin
tonight that supposedly offsets this reaction. Dr. Patel stopped in several times to see
how I was doing. Based on the blood work done this morning, he told me that my ovarian
cancer (CA125) marker was still ""high,"" although of course lower than before my surgery.
The hope is that the marker will decrease in number after each treatment. On the other
hand, the marker for colon cancer was completely normal, which is good news as I had a
small portion of my colon removed during surgery. Dr. Patel suggests that I not get too
fixated on both the marker number and prognosis at this point, which (as I've seen in
various chat rooms for ovarian cancer patients) can get easily fetishized, becoming the
object of either hysteria or jubilation. The 'one day at a time' m.o will be key. By the time
we were done it was 4:15. My friend Nan, who now lives in Philly but who spends July in
Bellefonte with her husband, my former colleague, Allan, picked my mother and me up
and, in my desire for ""instant gratification"" in the form of sugar, drove us to Meyer Dairy,
where I had a delicious small Mocha Chip and caramel sauce sundae, following the
                        
mantra of ""life is short; eat dessert first.""
As of now (6:00 p.m.), I feel no ill effects from my treatment, but this may well change in
a day or two. I'm tired, though. I am praying that I don't develop an infection, cold or
anything else that might interfere with my treatment. I'll return to Dr. Patel's office next
week for blood work and then in three weeks for the next round. And I'm supposed to
return to Hopkins soon to see if my stomach abscess has shrunk further, but Dr. Mehta
and I agreed we'd see how I'm feeling and if I'm up to travelling to Baltimore. As I write, I
am being 'infused' with micafungin, which I continue to take to resolve the lingering (but
much smaller) stomach abscess. So yes, a full time job for now...
There was one serious downer during my chemo session. I was seated next to a very
vocal Trumpiac, whose ideas were making me as anxious as my treatment, if not more.
He was ranting about the sins of the Democrats and pronounced: ""In the worst kind of
way I want to put a Rebel flag in my truck."" There were also references to ""brown
people,"" contrasted with the 'good' immigrants who came through Ellis Island (including,
apparently, this man's ancestors), and rants about decommemoration efforts (ie removal
of objectionable statues and state flags in the South). ""It's history,"" he kept proclaiming
flatly, as if history was immutable and could never be questioned or reinterpreted or
learned from. As poison was coursing through my veins, I simply did not have the fight in
me to take him on (as I've done at a flea market in Belleville where Rebel flags are
proudly sold). I simply asked the nurse to move me to the other side of the room. Living
in my nice progressive bubble of State College, I can forget that we're surround by deep
red rural areas -- prime MAGA country. Definitely stressed me out.
So I was on the 'narrow bridge' today. I wrote about this teaching attributed to Rabbi
Nachman of Breslov in another post, citing the translation as ""The whole world is a
narrow bridge, but the essence, (really… the crux of the matter), is not to be afraid."" I've
since read another translation that makes more sense to me. It stresses that what is
important, rather than not being afraid, is not giving in to the fear, not despairing. It
would be unnatural to *not* be afraid in difficult situations, especially ones involving
facing one's mortality -- as a side note, the absolute *fearlessness* of Alex Honnold,
who 'free soloed' 3,000 feet up El Capitan in Yosemite, without ropes, seems positively
unnatural and there is something downright feral about Alex (see the documentary!).
However, it now seems to me that holding the fear but not becoming paralyzed by it
will be key -- a delicate yet necessary balance for the days and weeks ahead.
A thank you to Michael and Sue for making me my 'last supper' before chemo - per my
request, a delicious grilled Hebrew National hot dog and part of a hamburger, fresh
tomato and potato salads, watermelon. Yum.

cream cone (I've lost twenty pounds so I'm not counting calories too rigidly), chatted
with a few visitors, and made headway editing the collective written reflection (now
eighty pages and counting) that my students and I wrote after our Holocaust-focused trip
to Paris over spring break. Of course, in my 'normal' life I'd be doing ten times more than
this -- working on articles and book projects with gusto, going full tilt with professional
and personal correspondence, taking a long walk, likely cooking something summery
(pesto, beets, a cobbler, borscht, tomato sauce, stuffed zucchini, caprese salad...), and
anticipating an enjoyable evening with friends over drinks or dinner. Admittedly, I need a
few extra measures of grace to be ok with giving at least some of this up for now,
because I enjoy it so much, as I do with renouncing for the time the kind of
adventuresome travel I like to do, including with my son. It's summer, and Facebook,
which I should likely avoid, abounds with pictures of smiling friends vacationing in far-
flung locales that I'd love to visit or revisit  (Greece, Norway, Taiwan, Italy) -- and of
course there is Paris, my 'second home.' I truly do not want to begrudge my friends their
happiness - on the contrary. Rather than envy, my feelings shade more into sadness and
'flatness' (the opposite of a feeling, I suppose, more likely depression). I need to keep the
long term goal in mind and commit myself to it every day-- treatment, recovery, ridding
my body of disease. The choice is obvious, but no less difficult.
As a modest travel goal, when I get better (or better-er) I'd love to spend a long weekend
or week with Ben in the condo my friend Jim is kindly offering to lend me in Austin. I've
only been there twice, and think it would be a great short term destination for a few chill
days of music, friends, Tex-Mex, and barbecue, perhaps with a day trip to San Antonio
and even some research at the Harry Ransom Center. I'm sure we'd like the vibe.
Paris is never far from both my conscious and unconscious. I've been having tons of
strange dreams, a few violent, many collapsing and conflating different eras of my life --
my childhood growing up in the Gramercy Park apartment (where one dream featured a
college classmate whom I haven't thought about in years), Ben's childhood (another
confronted me with about a six-year-old Ben), college (where I was being marginalized at
some sort of social function, with many college classmates dressed chicly in black and
myself walking sheepishly around the perimeter). The ""France"" dreams were actually
""French"" dreams. I had to answer one of three comprehensive exam type questions. I
                        
remember two of them: the theme of ""Amazones et économie"" in 18th c. France (on this
CB site the other day, my friend Jane, flatteringly I felt, compared me to an ""Amazon"")
and the theme of ""ordre"" (order) in eighteenth-century France (this second theme is
actually quite interesting and I think I'll store it away mentally to use on a future exam
for our students!). Who knew dreams could have such practical benefits!
Sitting here in limbo -- until my blood work on Thursday and my next chemo on 8/8. Will
my white blood count have gone up? And did my Neulasta patch activate as it was
supposed to, to further boost my while blood count? Will my blood pressure still be low?
Is my stomach abscess in check? Shrinking? I should find out when I return to Hopkins in
late August. When will my hair start falling out? ""Sitting here in limbo/Waiting for the dice
to roll/Sitting here in limbo/Got some time to search my soul."" 
As to my hair, tomorrow I'm getting it cut very short in anticipation of losing it. I can't
predict how I'll feel. I've never considered my hair my best feature (v. eyes, lips),
although it used to be quite lustrous when I was younger, so perhaps my locks will be
easier to part with (no pun intended) for now. My stylists certainly 'know the drill' as far
as clients' hair loss is concerned, so I'm sure they'll be sensitive. And an eyebrow powder
has been recommended to me for when those go too. I've gathered a number of scarves
from my collection and will see what works. Should I be a vamp? Une élégante? A hippie
chick? I have a vintage Peter Max 'psychedelic' scarf w/zodiac signs to pull that off (and
yes, I received it as a gift in the early 1970s! - see pic). Maybe I'll just pop on my
Yankees cap and call it a day.",5,sadness,0.80379474,0.009628857,0.007428308,0.0036214788,0.13366196,0.02909698,0.80379474,0.012767705
26,"I was apprehensive about the trip to the salon (the unknown, as usual), but all worked
out well, largely because the wonderful staff at J. Stephens, where I've been getting my
hair styled for years, was so caring and intent on making me feel good. Instead of going
for the full-out bald effect, which seemed radical to me at this point, I opted for a cute,
summery transitional bob. It both feels attractive and, because several inches were cut,
will likely soften the blow psychologically when my hair does fall out. In comparing a
picture of me sporting a bob at age three, I wonder if I am simply regressing in my look
and tastes -- soft comfort foods like pb&j for example are now back at the top of my list
of mealtime requests. I completed my outing with a visit to Ulta, where I bought some Ka-
Brow! eyebrow power that will hopefully help create a look that goes Ka-Boom! Since I
didn't sleep very well last night, I was too tired to do much else today (had wanted to get
to the Boalsburg farmers' market), but visits from friends Mary Kay and Gay were
cheering, and I read a long _New Yorker_ profile about Kamala Harris. Have taped
today's stage of the Tour de France, taking place in Provence just before the dramatic
ascent into the Alps, for evening watching. XO

27,"Today was a good day, which unexpectedly provoked several mini-laughing jags from me
(is this an inappropriate reaction? cue exaggerated stage whisper here: ""She has...
cancer...""). While in the waiting room at the oncologist, I texted with a friend about
cringe-worthy/sleazy/weird online dating profiles we've encountered, and she shared
that she once read a profile that included the following: ""I admire a woman who can use
sh-t and f-ck in a sentence"" [Horrified guffaw #1]. Good thing I've forsworn online dating 
�� Then, I received an incredibly vividly written email from my friend Randy, describing
his valiant yet ultimately failed efforts to muddle through the horrific 108 degree heat in
Paris, where a/c is in scarce supply. It sounded nightmarish, yet his descriptions were so
full of grim humor and brimming with insightful contrasts regarding how French and
Americans deal with extreme heat that I felt I was reading a _New Yorker_ vignette. To
wit: ""As I regaled in the last, cool, comforting waffs of air conditioning--an all too precious
commodity in this town, as you know--a friend (or rather, a fellow Etoile gazer) began
complaining that the A/C wasn't strong enough. Luckily, I caught myself before snapping,
""You just don't know how good you have it, do you?!!"" Instead, I just smiled as I headed
out"" [Laugh #2]. Then, a friend who stopped by recounted how a friend of hers lost her
hair from chemo and opted for a Willie Nelson wig (think two long blond 'man-braids'
running down one's back). [Chuckle #3].
But there was more reason to take heart, at least for today. My bloodcounts came back
""fab,"" according to nurse Kayla, with the white blood counts significantly boosted since
just before chemo. This means that the Neulasta worked well. Hemoglobin, kidney
function all good. As a 'reward' (but I'll take it), I'll get the full dose of chemo at the next
round (on 8/8), instead of the lower dose I received this last time because of the lowered
white blood count. There was no new news on the ovarian cancer marker (CA125) post-
chemo, a marker that Kayla and Dr. Patel both encourage me not to fixate on. I also
learned that I will likely have a scan (CT or PET) between rounds three and four, which I
wasn't anticipating. There again, I was encouraged to focus on the positive (ie ""this
treatment generally yields a good result"") rather than all the 'what ifs?' scenarios. I really
think I'm getting better at living in the present moment, a self-protective measure to be
sure.
After two cheering visits from food-bearing friends, my mother and I headed out again,
to see ""The Hair Lady,"" aka Katherine Fagan
(https://www.mmhairfashions.com/index.html),
a lovely woman who provides a valued service to women struggling with hair loss for
varied reasons (and others who simply wish to purchase hairpieces). I initially thought I'd
only consider a human hair wig (if I do purchase a wig, which I likely will), largely based
on my outdated image of synthetic hair wigs as very unnatural looking. I noticed
                        
immediately, though, that the synthetics are very far from wigs of our foremothers'
generations. They are lightweight, comfortable, and look great! With Katherine's help, I
had so much fun trying them on and seeing what I'd look like in different hair shades
(like playing dress up), that I almost forgot the reason I was there. �� Again, living in the
moment may be key: ""There's only us/There's only this/Forget regret/Or life is yours to
miss/No other road/No other way/No day but today.""
Should you care to, please let me know which style(s) you prefer (but no obligation!).
Those pictures feature the colors available in the shop as models; my hair color can be
matched to any style -- or I can try a new color. And some bangs can be trimmed a bit,
and other adjustments made...

I still puzzle about whether I should be complying with tacit expectations that I be a
'cancer victim' - a colleague I have not been in touch with since late April wondered how
she might ""brighten my day"" -- when, on weekends such as this for example and perhaps
somewhat in proportion to the reality of my health challenges, my heart is brimming with
gratitude and hopefulness.
Ben is my best medicine. His visits feel healing. Why? Because we talk, laugh, share,
enjoy activities together, and simply feel the comfort and ease of being around each
other. He has shown himself to be incredibly compassionate and courageous, when
avoidance or paralysis by anxiety might have been more understandable reactions. He is
ok with meeting me where I am right now. I just hope I can still be the mother he's used
to having. Alright, Ben, I'll stop embarrassing you now! :)
Every time Ben visits, my cooking mojo seems to return, which I equate with creativity
and energy directed towards one of my favorite activities. For dinner last night, I made a
trio of summer salads, drawing on the late July bounty of central PA: an Ethiopian potato
and beet salad I first sampled at a restaurant in DC (onions and jalapenos, in a lemony
dressing); a tomato, mozza and basil salad, with a balsamic glaze I made (the Trader
Joe's brand contains too many preservatives); and an heirloom cherry tomato salad with
homemade pesto. Add some crusty baguette, a runny slice of Brie, and voilà.
As mentioned in another post, my Zen space of late is to be found along any of our many
local creeks. Ben and I enjoyed Spring Creek, a prime destination for fly fisherpeople, at
two different points - Spring Creek Park and Fisherman's Paradise. The creek gurgles, the
sun dapples the water, hummingbirds dance, dense foliage sways, and anglers cast their
fly lines, forming arabesques. Dangling my feet in the chilly creek was divine. It all felt so
peaceful, and made me think about a line in one of our prayers at services recently --
something about keeping ""hope in our hearts and eternity in our thoughts."" To me,
'eternity' does not connote, for example, heaven or hell - which I don't believe in - but
rather some sort of immanence or transcendence.
The peaceful scene also conjured, somehow, these lines from William Blake:
""To see a World in a Grain of Sand/ And a Heaven in a Wild Flower/Hold Infinity in the
palm of your hand/And Eternity in an hour [...] Man was made for Joy and Woe/And when
this we rightly know/Through the world we safely go."" 
  
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour.

30,"My hair started falling out last night, right before I went to bed. It was certainly
disconcerting, an OMG moment, and just felt *wrong* - like I should have been able to
figure out how to stick the hair back in or 'fix it' some other way. I lost no time this
morning ordering a wig. I settled on the short red one, but may order it in a shade closer
to my natural color; if I buy a second one, I may well go bolder, but maybe not as bold as
the pink 'L'il Kim' wig Samantha sported on _Sex and the City._ And I guess I'll have to
YouTube scarf folding techniques, as I can't seem to figure out how to to turn them into
anything I'd feel comfortable having wrapped around my head.
Thanks to my friend Aileen, I have now made contact with a group of about five *local*
ovarian cancer survivors (including one currently undergoing treatment). They call
themselves the ""III Cs,"" after the stage at which all of them were diagnosed. I was also
diagnosed at this stage, apparently a common stage for ovarian cancer, which can be
largely asymptomatic (as was my case) and is therefore often diagnosed late. As I
understand it, three of these women are at least twelve-year survivors; I've also come to
understand that in many cases ovarian cancer can be a chronic disease that people live
with -- and live *well* with -- for a normal life span. There has been tremendous progress
in the treatments. In any event, I can't wait to meet these women!
The President's incendiary tweets about Baltimore struck a nerve with me, as over the
past three months I've become very fond of this city. A shout out here as well to my
Eagle cousins, college friend David Miranda and his partner, Peter, and other
Baltimoreans I know and love. True, the urban blight one encounters driving through
Baltimore can be shocking, even scary. It always strikes me as a sad cry for help in a
vibrant city of such historic import, world-class institutions, and great potential. The
good, dignified men and women of Baltimore changed my sheets every morning for
three weeks in the hospital; greeted me kindly on several stays at the Residence Inn,
many of whose customers are patients being treated at Hopkins; Ubered me to and from
the medical center, wishing me a blessed day on arrival; poured me lemonade when I
was thirsty; and continue to provide me with life-giving medical care of the highest
quality. So stay strong, Charm City! I'm coming for you in late August, and will be sure to

I continue to lose my hair -- it's in my comb, my hands, the sink. Ugh. For some reason
the first image that came to mind was -- sans a specific 'witch' comparison! -- that of the
Wicked Witch of the West's body dissolving into goop (""I'm melting, melting!""). For the
first time since I was about twelve, I wrapped a bandanna around my head and tied it at
the nape of my neck. I sort of felt/looked like 'cancer girl' but I'm sure I'll get used to it. I
also realized that I've become my grandmother when she was younger, babushka and all
(see photo; my grandmother Bessie is on the left, my great-grandmother Bella is center,
and my great-aunt Sarah, right).
Thanks to my grade-school friend Lisa, I discovered the website TLC, which offers a
dizzying trove of options for women in treatment for cancer. I bought four different types
of 'headgear' - a so-called 'chemo beanie,' pre-tied headscarf, turban, and a cute little
floral number for sleeping. The selection was really quite tempting and knowing me I
realize that this could become... dangerous. In fact,  I was so jazzed by my foray into
online shopping (which I don't do much), that I headed right over to the online sale at my
favorite Parisian clothing store, Anne-Elisabeth, snagging the shirt and skirt that I surely
would have treated myself to had I been in Paris this summer, as planned.
I wasted no time today in returning to ""the Hair Lady,"" to finalize details (model, hair
color) of my wig order. I am happy with the purchase and with the compassionate,
excellent service from Katherine Fagan. We really hit it off and I'm looking forward to
getting together socially with her soon.
I also look forward to lunch with one of the ""3 Cs"" (local OC survivors) next week; that
day I'll also join a picnic for another local support group for survivors of cancers primarily
affecting women.
Big storm clouds are rumbling outside and soon I have to give myself my daily
micafungin infusion (about three more weeks of this, in addition to two antibiotics, which
hopefully will completely clear up whatever remains of the abscess in my stomach).

continuing to befall our country, of course...). Just a normal, pleasant summer weekend,
albeit a bit less active one (especially in the evenings) than I'd be used to in my life 'b.c.'
On Thursday my friend Gay and I strolled the arboretum, then returned to Gay's house to
have lunch on her deck overlooking a lovely lily pond stocked with koi fish. That night I
watched a new Netflix film,""Otherhood,"" about three moms (played by Angela Bassett,
Patricia Arquette and Felicity Huffman), who, miffed that their twenty-something sons
have forgotten to send them Mother's Day cards, decide to show up unannounced at
their apartments in NYC (havoc followed by self-discovery and bonding ensues). There
were some chuckles, and a few tears at the end (for example, when a son writes his
mother a list of things he knows about her -- eg ""You love irises"" -- having failed at this
task on demand from his mother a few weeks earlier). It was good fluff for a Friday night
but mainly pretty ""meh."" Saturday morning, my friend Helen and I checked out the
farmers market in all its August glory; I was tempted by corn, cherry tomatoes, fennel,
cantaloupe, and eggplant. We then had lunch at Wegmans Cafe and finished our grocery
shopping. Today I browsed/shopped at Tait Farm and Pier 1 Imports, where I saw a
dresser that would look great in my bedroom, if I only I can figure out how to get it
home. Funny how, given the question marks around my health, I'm feeling nesting
instincts. Have all kinds of ideas for redoing certain rooms and areas of my home that
could use some sprucing (although I still love my condo!). Did some walking, reading,
writing, finished editing and compiling the blog (86 pages!) that my students and I wrote
about our Holocaust-focused trip to Paris in March. And my longtime house cleaner, Liz,
just dropped off, unexpectedly, a scrumptious looking eggplant parmigiana that her
husband, Phil, a talented home cook (esp. of Italian classics), wanted to make for me.
While I continue to be really sad about missing several milestone events in the lives of
friends this summer - three out of town or country weddings to be precise, which I
couldn't/can't attend due to the timetable my treatment and recovery -- I am so grateful
for these simple yet meaningful pleasures and acts of kindness closer to home.

First stop: back to the ""Hair Lady"" aka Katherine Fagan to pick up my wig, which I love.
I'm not averse to wearing scarves and turbans, but my hair's tied up with my femininity
somehow, so it's part of my identity. It's a bit tricky to care for it but I'm sure that before
long I'll get the knack of shampooing, conditioning, brushing, and transporting it with
some products made for that purpose. The wig's name is ""Emma,"" so perhaps Emma is
my new alter ego. I'll go one step further and announce, with a hat tip to ""I am...Sasha
Fierce,"" Beyoncé's third solo album presenting her own alter ego: I am....Emma Fierce.
Second stop: Lunch with some pretty fierce ladies, two of the ""III Cs."" Helen and Deb are
OC survivors (over ten years in both cases, although at different places in terms of
ongoing treatment). They were both very open in sharing their stories, generous with
helpful practical information (I went right to the supermarket afterwards and procured
ginger tea and oranges), reassuring, and understanding. They get it. Most importantly,
they are vibrant, living their lives to the fullest each day. So maybe a corollary to
Groucho Marx's ""I wouldn't want to be part of any club that I was a member of"" is ""I am
happy to be a member of this club, even though it's a club most people wouldn't choose
to be part of."" I look forward to seeing these women again, and hopefully to meeting the
other two ""III Cs."" Now we are five. A sorority! Ht also to my friend Aileen, who was the
initial facilitator of the group, and who connected me to it.
Third stop: a picnic with another group of resilient, lively women, all breast cancer
survivors, to which my friend, neighbor and fellow JCC congregant Carol invited me, even
though I do not have breast cancer. The message I got from all my convos with survivors
today: no day but today. Also: while being on the narrow bridge can be very scary, once
you're on it and the precarious situation has been normalized -- as I found today from the
completely matter-of-fact exchanges -- it can really become much less scary. It's often
more frightening for those looking on from the outside.
Second round of chemo tomorrow. Kind friends are driving me to and from, and I hope to
have at least two visitors, to break up the monotony of the long, boring day spent
hooked up to the drip. I've packed up my dragonfly bag with some snacks, face and hand
creams, books, iPad, coloring book (yes!), music etc. And I'll pull on my supersoft pink
Penn State hoodie, some yoga pants, and one of my cute new caps that arrived today,
and hunker down for six or seven hours. Hopefully the effects won't be too much worse
than last time.

Everything went well with my second round of chemo today. My blood work all came in
at normal/good levels and I was therefore able to receive all the meds (Benadryl, an anti-
nausea med, and some other med, then the chemo meds, Carboplatin and Taxol). Total
drip time: about five hours. I then had the Neulasta patch affixed to my arm, which will
boost my white blood cell production, but which can cause bone pain (I will take some
Claritin to help counteract this reaction). So far so good - I just feel tired as I took
Compazine, an anti-nausea med that can cause drowsiness. There will certainly be a few
bad days ahead, but hopefully not much worse than last time, and I did rebound pretty
quickly.
I had a minor freak out when Dr. Patel would not tell me my CA125 (ie ovarian cancer
marker) number when I inquired. I presume that it's still high (then again I did not
receive the full dose of the chemo meds last time), but I think his point is for me not to
fixate on this number - which is only part of the story - nor on prognosis. He wants me to
focus on this needed treatment and to stay strong and positive (which I am doing). I
honestly think that, in the end, this is the best strategy for me, as even on my best days
I tend to be a worrier. He said he'd tell me the marker number after the next treatment.
He also helped me better understand how the chemo works, and how sneaky cancer
cells can fight against the treatment in various crafty ways. This is why chemo does not
necessarily provide 'immunity' during the treatment period, although it certainly, and in
the majority of cases, can be very effective. Let's hope so.
Believe it or not, the ranting Trump supporter who during my last session was warning
that he was ""this close"" to putting a Rebel flag in his pickup was back today!! He walked
in with his wife when I had already been seated for a while (I had preemptively chosen
the treatment bay on the side of the room opposite the one where I had been seated last
time). When he entered the chemo room and was looking for an empty recliner, he
loudly announced to no one in particular: ""Last time a lady asked to be moved across the
room because of me!"" I waved to him wanly, and said, semi-jokingly: ""Please no political
rants today,!"" and then wished him good health. His wife then came over to sort of
'make nice' with me. I took the high road and again wished her husband good health.
Nary a rant to be heard from him, just lots of talk about 'hauling' (this is the operative
verb in these parts) the Amish in his truck to their various construction jobs and buying
peaches in bulk at the local produce market. Cancer's an adventure, let me tell ya.
Today's monotony was broken up by two lovely visitors: first Rhonda, my 'mentor' in the
Woman to Woman program at Hopkins who happens to live about 25 miles from me in
Lewistown, and who is often in State College. I knew from speaking with her on the
phone that we had a great rapport, and this was confirmed today (picture attached). She
is very kind, upbeat, encouraging, and knowledgeable. Her visit really uplifted me. I am
understanding that these kinds of connections will be crucial to my recovery. Then my
                       122 / 1.901
friend Maria came by bearing a coffee milkshake for me from Meyer Dairy. We had fun
chatting as always, and then she deposited me at home (my kind neighbors Pat and
Dennis drove me to my appointment early this morning).

I feel fine (had sushi lunch with my friend Clare; entertained a doctoral student receiving
his degree at commencement this weekend, with his family in tow). But by Saturday the
Mack truck has rolled back into town, flattening me in its wake. I can barely get out of
bed, and feel weak and achy in my legs, neck etc. Think bad flu symptoms. Minimal
nausea, though, and I even refrained from taking an anti-nausea med because it makes
me very groggy. Somehow I managed to get to the farmers market yesterday morning to
pick up some zucchini to make a frittata for dinner -- despite my taste buds being all out
of whack. Today I was able to sit outside for a while and send some texts and read for
just a bit. The rest of the time I was horizontal. If things proceed like last time, I hope to
feel somewhat better tomorrow, although I'm told that the effects of the chemo can be
cumulative.  The weather is gorgeous -- slightly cooler, mellow sunshine, with just a whiff
of 'back to school' in the air (I will not be heading back to school, though, as I'll be on
medical leave in the fall). It would have been a perfect day for a hike or long walk, for
going to a greenhouse and puttering around my mini-garden, or hanging out in a park
with a friend. Or even doing some work! That makes me feel sad/mad/depressed. But I
                       124 / 1.901
need to simply roll with this... 
My 'life preserver' this weekend, aside from my own resilience, has come in the form of
many caring texts, emails (including from France!), and phone calls from friends, family
and neighbors. My friend Sandy came over with both some scarves for me to try out as
well as some delicious Middle Eastern rice pudding with cardamon, honey, vanilla, and
pistachios that hits the spot in terms of taste and texture. So many people have been so
kind, and it gives me such motivation to pay it forward...
Hope to have a better report before long. Love, Willa",5,sadness,0.96334916,0.0014258856,0.0025080636,0.011505269,0.005505515,0.010496998,0.96334916,0.0052091233

The human body is amazing. The human body urges to heal. The thirteen-hour process
of 'debulking' my body in May in an effort to rid if of all visible cancer was at the same
time turning my body into a lean, mean, cancer-fighting machine. I had multiple organs
removed and could barely get out of bed the first weeks in the hospital, but I have
relatively little residual abdominal pain now. The pesky abscess in my stomach that
delayed my chemo for several weeks was neatly cordoned off, as if willing itself not to
spread further (I'll find out if it's completely resolved when I go to Hopkins next week).
And if two days ago I was in a stupor, with aches radiating through my legs (still feeling a
bit 'neuropathic' in my feet...), today I am definitely on the rebound! There will be crappy
days, and there will be better days, without doubt. And just because the body
instinctively reaches for healing, of course, doesn't mean it will heal, especially in the
face of disease. But the instinct is there, and that is reason for hope.
So I wonder with my favorite American poet, Walt Whitman, writing in 1855 in _Leaves of
Grass,_ whether the body, rather than corrupting the soul, ""were not the soul"" itself. It
certainly seems as pure and divine and miraculous sometimes.
I don't know why I scheduled a (routine) 7h15 dermatological checkup but I made it
there just fine. Everything looks good, and the dr. says there is nothing to suggest that
I'm at any greater risk for skin cancer than I was before. It was so early (at least for me -
not an early riser...) when my appointment ended that I went to a nearby coffee shop for
a cappuccino and a muffin. Then I got to some emails that had accumulated while I was
wiped out the previous days, and a bit of reading. I took a drive to Pier 1 Imports, where
I'm very tempted by a dresser on sale, and on an impulse bought some fun Eiffel Tower
LED 'gimmer' lights for my little back patio. I'm thinking tapas party. Yes, a hopeful sign!

My longtime hair stylist and friend, Sarah, showed me such compassionate care
yesterday, cutting most of my remaining hair off and trimming my wig so that, in the
end, it approximates my usual hairstyle (so much for looking like a blond bombshell or a
silver fox...). To top it off, she gifted me with my choice of a Disney Princess brush --
quite a hoot, but it turns out these are the brushes with the best bristles for brushing my
wig! I chose Snow White (I don't even know who Princess Jasmine is...). Like Snow White,
maybe I'll wake up from a long slumber and realize this was all just a (bad) dream.
Maybe there'll even be a Prince Charming awaiting. And some dwarfs. Who knew a brush
could be so beneficial?
Today I received a lovely gift box full of goodies my brother and his family picked out for
me during their recent trip to Israel and Jordan. Most significant to me is the scarlet
string bracelet that my family had blessed at the Kotel in Jerusalem. Kabbalistic beliefs
and Jewish folk customs hold that a scarlet string knotted seven times and worn on the
left wrist (ie the receiving side of the spiritual body) can ward off misfortune caused by
the evil eye. Red string bracelets exist in other folk cultures too. So now the bracelet is
tied firmly on my wrist, next to a thin chain with a hamsa. In Hebrew, hamsa means 'five'
and images of open hands containing a turquoise or aqua-colored eye are prevalent
throughout the Middle East -- again as a protection against the evil eye. So between
these two bracelets and a hamsa pendant (plus several other hamsas and similar
amulets scattered throughout my home), I think I am pretty well 'covered.' Somehow the
image of the Crusaders, who literally covered themselves and their horses and weapons
with crosses (croix, cruces etc.) as protection came to mind. Am I a religious zealot?
Heck, no. But I'll gladly be a zealot against cancer!
I registered for, and am seriously thinking of attending, a conference organized by
Hopkins on Sept. 14 (at a hotel in the Inner Harbor) on ""Gynecological Cancer
Survivorship."" It draws together medical professionals (including all those on my care
team), survivors, care givers and others. There will be talks about the latest research
and treatments, Ted talks, a panel featuring five survivors, and breakout panels on some
cool topics. The three I signed up for are on ""Spirituality and Cancer,"" ""Nutrition and Diet
after Cancer,"" and ""Writing through Cancer"" (!!). As always, I'll need to figure out
logistics and whether or not I might have a friend or relative attend with me (which
would be nice), but I'm hoping I can make it work.

38,"This time of year, I (and doubtless others), as if on cue, begin having anxiety dreams
about school. In my latest one, I am taking a very difficult history test for which I'm
woefully unprepared (lots of other 'busy-ness' had interfered with my plan to reread the
course textbook cover to cover). The test consisted, in part, of twelve short
essays/analyses (with a word limit) based on images. The one image that I knew I could
write of ton about what that of Vercingetorix, the Gallic chief who resisted valiantly yet
ultimately unsuccessfully against the invading Romans (a metaphor for fighting the
                       132 / 1.901
'invading' cancer cells??). I planned to write about V. as a shape-shifting signifier,
portrayed as either a 'national' hero by Plutarch or a brave yet undisciplined barbarian
by Caesar. Another image featured a woman's hands reaching into a case where pies
were displayed (like in a diner), which I thought I could link to post-World War II
American middle-class consumer culture! In any event, I was making check marks by the
images I thought I might write about (and struggling to identify twelve), when Lynn Hunt,
a very prominent American historian of France, leaned over to me and said: ""There really
are a lot of good choices this year, aren't there? It's a good exam."" Yikes. A second part
of the exam was a long, DBQ (document-based question), involving synthesizing and
analyzing a lot of information and documents about...coal. The third part consisted of
many short identifications of extremely specific names, places, and works, most of which
I hadn't a clue about. I thought I recognized a section of quotation by Victor Hugo, about
the plight of the urban poor during mid-19th century industrialization, but I couldn't
remember the title nor the date, and knew that I'd need to fudge it. Good grief.
While I have had variants of this dream many times (yet few as vivid), this year I really
*am* unprepared. Normally at this time, I'd be writing syllabi, setting up reserve reading
lists, arranging visits to the Rare Book Room and Palmer Museum of Art, meeting with
students, preparing for our new graduate student orientation, and getting caught up in
the adrenaline rush of back to school. But I won't be doing any of that because I'm on
medical leave until January. So naturally I feel woefully 'out of sync,' 'off course,' my
natural instincts foiled or rerouted. It's depressing, and I am working on coming to peace
with my 'new normal' once school begins. I'm also figuring out how to structure my time
meaningfully and thinking about what kind of work (ie writing/research) I may be able to
accomplish. And of course I need to keep in mind the bottom line - ie my treatment and
recovery - which will allow me to get back to all the rest as soon as possible. And
focusing on my health requires a lot of time and energy.
Getting ready to go to Baltimore tomorrow (I'll return on Wednesday). I'll have a CT scan
to determine whether my stomach abscess has completely healed. If so, I may be able to
stop taking both the two antibiotics that have been shredding my stomach for at least a
month and the anti-fungal medicine that it takes me over an hour to administer to
myself daily. I am crossing my fingers here. I'll also get to meet briefly with Dr. Beavis,
my surgeon who is overseeing my care, and Dr. Mehta, who is treating the stomach
abscess. In much better news, Ben will come from DC so we can have dinner together on
Tuesday and he'll also spend the night at the Residence Inn before heading back to work
on Wednesday morning. I'm scouting around for restaurant recommendations and am
thinking red-sauce Italian in Little Italy, as long as the food is good!
Last night with my friend Helen I saw the film ""The Farewell,"" about the matriarch of a
Chinese family who is diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. The family agrees to hide this
news from her, and everyone is ""all in"" except her Chinese-American granddaughter,
who lives in New York. It's a quirky film, and I haven't yet decided if I liked it (although
                       133 / 1.901
I'm definitely glad I saw it). It seemed to not be able to make up its mind about whether
it was a comedy or a drama. The decision to not tell the grandmother that she was dying
was presented as culturally determined (is that really the case?), and the entire family
seemed to trade in many forms of keeping up appearances, 'good lies,' and denial. I
definitely don't think I'd want to be kept in the dark about a terminal cancer diagnosis
though (one character in the film points out that in the States this might be illegal...), as
traumatizing as that might be.
Have a good week, everyone.",2,fear,0.9443391,0.003555447,0.0030625637,0.9443391,0.0022684357,0.02047138,0.011273025,0.015030029
39,"I am rejoicing in two pieces of good news today, both related to the CT scan I had
yesterday at Hopkins. First the scan revealed, for the time being, no evidence of new
cancer. Among other things, this means that I can 'stay the course' with my treatment,
again for now, as opposed to the doctors having to think about new chemo drugs if the
current ones were proving ineffective. Second, the scan indicates that my stomach
                       135 / 1.901
abscess has healed! This means far less risk of an infection compromising my potentially
fragile immune system, with consequences for my chemo regimen. It also means that I
can stop taking the two antibiotics and one anti-fungal medication that I've been
diligently taking for about two months and that are wreaking havoc on my stomach! And
so, for now, goodbye to the iv pole that's been my companion every day for over an hour
as I administer the micafungin.
So all in all, a good visit to Hopkins. I was clearly anxious (""scanxious""), as my back
started to spasm every time I started thinking about receiving the scan results. I am very
glad that I was able to speak with Dr. Beavis, who is overseeing my care and who
performed my debulking surgery. We resolved some practical issues, such as whether I
can delay until December my yearly mammogram for fear it might irritate my port
(answer: yes) and the timetable for our next appointments. She also helped me
understand much more clearly the 'fluidity' of the notion of prognosis. She's been over
the aggregate data with me several times, ie 80% of women with ovarian cancer go into
remission after standard chemotherapy treatment. On the flip side, most ovarian cancer
patients will have a recurrence at some point following initial treatment. The averages
for patients treated at Hopkins appear to be more favorable (not unsurprisingly) - these
are averages. But then there is also each patient's individualized path, including whether
or not certain 'milestones' are met (ie patients whose cancer recurs during treatment v.
those whose cancer does not; patients who mark x months/years without a recurrence,
with each increment being significant). Down the road options with recurrences (likely in
the abdominal area again) would include more surgery and/or chemo. Sooo... while I
realize that I am still very much 'on the journey,' and while there will certainly be many
more scans upcoming, I was still happy for today's news. Every bit of good news counts.
Better than the alternative, certainly.
After a very good talk with Dr. Beavis, I had my CT scan. I was glad to have a highly
experienced technician I like (I think his name is Bill), who administers the contrast dye
slowly so that I don't feel the sudden freezing cold ""whoosh"" of the injection, which
immediately fills the mouth with a salty, metallic taste. The two times Bill was not my
technician, I got sick to my stomach after the scan. Bill also knew to position my arms by
my sides (rather than over my head), which also helped. And he's a PSU wrestling fan
too!
I don't know what possessed me to walk about half an hour back from the hospital to the
hotel in 95 degree heat, but somehow I managed to do it, slipping into the air
conditioning of a Starbucks for an iced cappuccino along the way.
Today's meeting was with Dr. Mehta, the infectious diseases specialist, who gave me the
good news about the scan.
Last night Ben took the commuter train from DC to Baltimore so we could have dinner
                       136 / 1.901
and he could stay in the hotel with me overnight. We had a great time. We opted for
classic Italian in Little Italy and chose a restaurant called La Scala, which did not
disappoint in the least! We split a Caesar salad (grade: A, and I'm a hard one to please),
with a tangy homemade dressing infused with lemon, anchovies and high grade
Parmesan, and ultra-crisp Romaine. I opted for spaghetti (more like bucatini) carbonara,
as my taste buds are tending to favor creamy (yogurt, ice cream, avocados, cream) and
sweet over dry and savory (eg a hamburger) these days. Although my taste is clearly a
bit off, I could tell it was delicious, and I ate most of it. Ben had shrimp Fra Diavolo, which
he loved. After dinner we walked to Vaccaro's, a legendary Little Italy bakery, and picked
up some cannoli and cookies, which we indulged in while watching two episodes of a
new (?) cooking/travel show with Gordon Ramsay. Ramsay is no Anthony Bourdain (but
who could ever be?); nevertheless, Ben and I enjoyed watching him cook with unusual
ingredients (camel, anyone?) while travelling around with the 'locals' in Morocco and
Hawaii.
My efforts to try to make amends for our President by telling Baltimoreans how much I
appreciate their city met with (very) mixed success. The first person to whom I
proclaimed ""I love Baltimore!,"" the front desk manager at the hotel, simply smiled and
said ""thank you."" The second, a maintenance worker at the hotel, said in response: ""I
hate Baltimore. I can't wait to get back to California, where I'm from."" The third person, a
clerk registering me for my CT scan at Hopkins, gushed enthusiastically about Baltimore,
his home town, and the fourth, an Uber driver, simply responded ""Crickets"" (ie no
response/enough said). Ben wisely encouraged me, despite my well-meaning instincts,
not to try to 'save' Baltimoreans single-handedly. As I can attest, they're doing just fine,
thank you very much.
On my return from Baltimore just a while ago, I found a gorgeous bouquet from my
friend Cheryl (to whom I will write to thank shortly). What a kind gesture, and what a
lovely gift to come home to after a whirlwind trip!",2,fear,0.50656766,0.009964807,0.0023551073,0.50656766,0.3598621,0.08409091,0.017257359,0.01990203
40,"I spent part of yesterday at the hospital in Lewistown (about 25 miles from here), to
meet with a genetic counselor, Tara Schmidlen, and then have the actual testing done. I
was annoyed that the counselor did not seem to know if I even needed this 'germline'
testing (as opposed to the tumor testing done following my surgery) because she could
not access all the pertinent records from Hopkins. I imagine that this frustrating situation
arises when several doctors in several facilities are involved in the care of one patient,
but still... When I was having the bloodwork done, however, Tara came racing down to
the lab to let me know that she had spoken to Dr. Beavis' nurse and I did, indeed, still
need to have the germline testing done. So the confusion was resolved in the end.
Testing on this panel of 20 genes (and ultimately as many as 84 genes, should I choose)
will help my doctors determine which drugs will be the most effective for my post-chemo
maintenance treatment. Further, the testing may even impact my current chemo
regimen. Given that my mother is BRCA negative (ie her BReast CAncer does not appear
to have been inherited but the result of a genetic mutation), chances are that my
ovarian cancer also resulted from a random genetic mutation as well... which is why I
sometimes say not ""Why me?"" but rather ""Why not me?"" Cancer seems such a Russian
roulette sometimes.
I rewarded myself for that trip over the mountains to Lewistown with a mint flake ice
cream cone (ice cream being one of the staples of my diet now, it would seem). And I
had to rest when I got home. A fifty mile round-trip drive would not normally tire me out,
but I do tire more easily than usual these days. I rebounded sufficiently to make it to
services, where the phrase ""steadfast spirit"" stuck with me from the evening's readings.
This morning a nurse came over to deaccess my port as I am no longer administering the
micafungin daily through it. So for now no more large, unsightly patch covering my port
but a simple bandaid. After that, I shopped at Trader Joe's and the farmers market,
where I ran into a Jewish Studies colleague who didn't know I had been diagnosed with
cancer (holding his understandably troubled reaction caused me some stress). Then
                       139 / 1.901
home to prepare a few things for a lovely lunch with a colleague, Cheryl, who had also
shown concern when she learned about my health challenge and was kind enough to
visit. Again after that sequence of events, I needed to rest a bit but am supposed to go
out for dinner and music later with my friends Mar and Jessica.
I went to school last week for the first time since May, when I left my office in a panicked
flurry after receiving my initial diagnosis by phone. I received a very warm welcome from
staff, a colleague or two (although none of my own departmental colleagues were
around), and a grad student. Big hugs all around. My plan is to stay connected by
attending defenses, book parties, lectures and other events on campus, as my health
allows. Fading away completely this semester will be too depressing, and it might even
be helpful for my colleagues to see me too.
Looking forward to a few nice lunches this week, including with the remaining two ""III

Deb. So grateful for the nearby presence of these 'sisters,' all long-term OC survivors,

Today brought lunch with the remaining two ""III Cs"" (local ovarian cancer survivors thus
self-named because of the stage at which they were diagnosed). Like Helen and Deb
whom I met over lunch a few weeks ago, Jackie and Jan (see pic) were both very kind,
generous in sharing their experiences, affirming, and encouraging. Both are long-term
survivors, full of pep, who lead extremely active lives (Jackie, originally from Scotland,
takes yoga, Zumba, cycling and strength training classes at the Y while Jan walks daily
and winters in Florida). Both had recurrences of their ovarian cancer -- which will be the
likelihood for me as well -- which meant more chemo, but both got through it. And at
least one of them also had breast cancer following ovarian cancer. Both appear to be
fully in remission now, and for quite a number of years. They both seem to be living their
best lives, embracing and practicing the 'no day but today' message.
I was especially grateful to have lunch with them today as it's the first day of the new
school year and I feel a bit sad and depressed that I'm not part of it. The lunch helped, as
did a visit from my friend and colleague, Nancy. I look forward to two more lunches with
friends before chemo on Thursday. I'm sure once I get into a new rhythm with some
structure-providing activities (I'm looking into a new gym), I'll feel better. And I definitely
think I made the right decision taking a medical leave this semester, giving myself ample
time/space to devote to my treatment and recovery. It's hard for me to imagine how I
would have handled the rigors of my job with my ongoing chemo treatments,
procedures, medical appointments, fatigue etc.
I asked Jackie and Jan what it felt like to be 'on the other side' of their cancer journey.
Jackie said that she now views the active treatment phase as ""another life,"" firmly in the
past. Both of them seemed to me clearly anchored in the ""new normal,"" or the ""new old
normal,"" slipping easily from accounts of their diagnosis and treatment into more
present concerns and pastimes: gardening, travel, grandchildren. A friend suggested --
and this hadn't really occurred to me -- that I may be, ironically, in a sort of ""love"" stage
of my journey, marked by both an outpouring of love from those around me that feels
like a healing balm and my own narcissistic love of -- or perhaps rather obsession with --
my own disease, which feels all-consuming. I can't even imagine what it will feel like to
be on the other side of this. I suppose -- and I hope -- that I'll find out.",5,sadness,0.8898966,0.0011470966,0.0025330046,0.0014695736,0.050465416,0.03837252,0.8898966,0.0161158

Three down, three to go. Unless anything goes amiss, of course. This could include
notably high/low numbers on the lab work I have done right before treatment;
indications that the treatment is ineffective; a bad cold or infection (such as the recently-
healed abscess in my stomach). There is so much uncertainty on this journey, and it's
hard to sit with that, although I am trying extra hard to take good care of myself with a
healthy diet, lots of sleep, avoidance of big crowds and of kissing/hugging anyone with a
cold etc. Common sense measures.
But today things went smoothly, although I was not pleased to wake up at 6:15 a.m for a
7:15 appointment, to which my kind neighbor Janis drove me. My lab report looked good
overall (I'm especially encouraged by good white blood cell counts), so I was able to
proceed to my full treatment (benadryl, an anti-allergy med, an anti-nausea med, then
the chemo meds, Carboplatin and Taxol). The seven+ hours went pretty quickly between
some time to rest, read and send texts and heartening visits from friends. In the
morning, my dear friend Gay came to chat for a while. I also got a quick hug from
Rhonda, my wonderful mentor/friend/angel/fellow survivor from the Hopkins
Woman2Woman support organization for OC survivors and those beginning or going
through treatment (see pic). In the afternoon, my lovely friend Helen came to visit,
bearing a vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy. Actually, I was not really supposed to eat
this as my glucose level is high (a result of taking ten steroid pills last night and this
morning). But when the nurse said ""everything in moderation"" (partially overriding what
my doctor had said), I couldn't resist the soothing, creamy, sugary deliciousness of the
milkshake. Mea culpa. So much for healthy diet thus far today but I'll compensate at
dinnertime with some broth-based carrot soup and an avocado.
The rabid Trumpian was not there today. As a precaution, like last time I selected a
treatment bay that is set apart from all the others. Also, all the nurses are extremely
capable, solicitous and caring, which helps reduce anxiety around the treatment.
After I had finished, Helen and I made a quick pit stop at the Amish produce stand on the
way back to my house, where I bought some beets, zucchini and eggplant to buttress
other healthy/healthier food choices. By the time I got home I was tired and needed to
rest for a while.
Heartfelt thanks to friends and family members who sent notes and texts of
encouragement and left a goodie bag for me on my return from chemo (!). In no way
whatsoever did I expect this, but I very much appreciate these caring acts. Thanks to
everyone indulging me by reading my journal, which is proving quite therapeutic for me.
Lunches with my dear friends Kathryn (Tuesday) and Clare and Lisa (Wednesday) and a
visit and dessert exchange (plum clafoutis for peach compote) with Chris were also lots
of fun!
                       146 / 1.901
I did, in the end, buy the dresser at Pier1 that I thought would be perfect for my bedroom
and much more proportional than my previous dresser. It also matches two little end
tables in my bedroom also purchased at Pier1 a few years ago. So, living by the mantra
of ""life is short; buy the dresser,"" I enlisted the help of ""Team Truglio/Fox"" (my dear
friend Maria, fiance Greg and son Anthony) to move this *large and heavy* dresser in a
truck I rented for this purpose (the store would not deliver). Their combination of muscle
power and logistical savvy allowed them to pull off this feat without a hitch. And I'm
loving my dresser! Planning a few other upgrades to my condo this fall as well.
Can't wait to see Ben and Sammi this Sunday-Monday as they are coming up for the long
weekend. I will most likely be crashed out from chemo (if I follow the pattern of days 3-4
post-chemo being the worst), but I've already cooked and frozen some cream of tomato
soup and will make a few more dishes ahead of time. I know that they will be
understanding and helpful and it will be great to spend time with them.

sleeping (my friend Maria kindly brought me some dinner). I felt well enough on
Thursday evening and all Friday, and made it to services on Friday night. But yesterday I
was hit with crushing fatigue, accompanied by tingling in my fingers, aches in my neck,
arms and legs, and an upset stomach. I took some anti-nausea meds but don't feel that
nauseous. All in all, I think the symptoms may be worse this time than the two previous
                       149 / 1.901
ones. Today I got out of bed at around 9:30 and feel marginally better, but still quite
wiped out. I'm looking forward to seeing Ben and Sammi later and hopefully they'll be
able to help me a bit. I wish they didn't have to see me this way.
I'm trying to just roll with it - there's no choice - but the situation is depressing and
makes me really hate this disease. I would much rather have been out enjoying the nice
weather and festive atmosphere around town with our first home game taking place, or
else in Arizona at a conference I was supposed to attend with many of my former
students (who nicely sent pictures of what looked like a great gathering). These crashes
are a bit hard to manage without a 'caregiver' but I'm bearing up. And I'm
hoping/expecting to start feeling better tomorrow, if the usual pattern holds. Clawing
myself out of such a deep hole of fatigue seems daunting, but I trust in my capacity to
rebound and will allow myself as much space as I need to rest.
Thanks for the good thoughts, everyone.",5,sadness,0.9085883,0.0020695943,0.0038550636,0.05524651,0.008875312,0.014745963,0.9085883,0.0066193286

Some people seem to find me courageous, even inspiring. I'm sure to many that's the
more appealing version of my 'cancer self.' I certainly don't always feel courageous nor
can I or anyone else always expect me to be. Not when I was wincing in pain yesterday
because my lower GI track felt inflamed and throbbing (seems better today after a diet
of yogurt, a banana and some cheese but Dr. Patel says if symptoms get worse I should
go to ER for evaluation). And not when I read the many harrowing accounts of women
dealing with multiple recurrences on a Facebook page called Sisterhood of Ovarian
Cancer Survivors. It's been hard to gird on a shield of courage the past 3-4 days because
the effects of round 3 of chemo were so wretched, leaving me feeling not only exhausted
but also vulnerable and deflated. I realize that in my last post I may have been pulling
for some sympathy. Thank you for indulging me.
Ben and Sammi, visiting from DC, were extremely kind, understanding and helpful,
although I felt badly that I couldn't host them in the way I'm used to. I had done some
cooking before chemo, but they also cooked up some eggs for breakfast, washed all the
dishes and tidied up the kitchen. I had just enough energy on Sunday to take a drive
along a pretty country road to The Hummingbird Room, a local restaurant/caterer
situated in an old farmhouse in Spring Mills. The co-owner, Eric Sarnow (formerly of Le
Bec Fin, in Philly) is a fabulous chef and every so often he and his wife stock up a big red
barn behind the house with some of their specialty items for purchase. We bought some
delicious salmon roe mousse, to-die-for chocolate sauce for ice cream, and granola, and
snagged a bag of peaches for free on the way out, which later I cooked into compote. On
Monday, we enjoyed ice cream cones and sundaes at Meyer Dairy (perhaps no wonder a
stomach ache resulted?). The rest of the weekend was mellow -- I rested, Ben and
Sammi went to the game, grocery shopped at Trader Joe's, and went for a run. In the
evening we watched episodes of The Great British Baking Show. It was very comforting
having them here.
Today my stomach was hurting in the morning, so I stayed in bed late, annoyed at
myself that I couldn't get up earlier. I have to keep reminding myself that self-care has to
be my priority, whatever that takes. With that in mind, today I luxuriated in a hot stone
pedicure and spa manicure at a local day spa that Ben had treated me to for my bday in
March (thanks to a gift certificate). The technician spent over two hours indulging me in
paraffin treatments for my hands, rubbing my legs with hot stones (which really helped
my bone pain!) and my arms with bergamot-scented oil, and painting my nails a pretty
'orchid' color I had picked up in Paris and that I thought worked well for late summer. :)
When I came home I took a walk. I need to build up my strength after being so wiped out
for several days - and the weather's beautiful.
I'm really hoping to continue to feel better tomorrow.

                       157 / 1.901
(Beavis) and my Geisinger/State College doctor (Patel) consulted today and ordered
abdominal and pelvic CTs for tomorrow afternoon. The unpleasant prep includes drinking
two bottles of a barium solution before my appointment at 2:30. Cause is unclear: effects
of chemo drugs? inflammation noted on a previous CT scan but that is in my small
intestine, not my lower GI track (that CT scan did not reveal evidence of a fistula or
adhesion to abdominal wall, which would be much more serious)? Infection?
Hemorrhoid? Continuing effects of the 'mother of all surgeries' that I had performed in
May? New cancer (Dr. Beavis noted that chances of this happening during chemo are
actually <5%)? So.much.uncertainty. Ditto for treatment options: at one end of the
spectrum, whatever the issue may be may resolve on its own. On the other: surgical
intervention might be needed (please, no). I understand that the scan is being ordered
out of an abundance of caution, to rule things out, and I am very grateful for how
thoroughly and well Drs. Beavis and Patel (and their nurses) are taking care of me. Yet I
can't help feeling anxious.
Fortuitously -- the advantages of living in a college town -- at the supermarket this
evening I ran into Jackie, one of my fellow 'IIICs' (local OC survivors). She promptly
validated my feelings of anxiousness, said that she had shared them when she was
receiving treatment, and noted that time (over the course of her treatment) had seemed
to help her anxiety abate. She urged me to ""pick up the phone anytime"" I needed to talk.
Grateful to have had this 'sister' placed in my path at Wegmans, shortly before I ran into,
on exiting the store, Art and Nancy, a lovely couple from my synagogue who own local
clothing stores and whom I've known nearly since I arrived in State College in 1988. They
had heard about my cancer diagnosis from our common hair stylist, Sarah (again, the
small town effect...), and provided warm hugs and encouragement.
September is Gynecologic Awareness Month. Learn more below. Dr. Wethington is one of

46,"As I wrote in my last post, some stomach discomfort led my doctors to order an
abdominal and pelvic CT scan, which I had yesterday. That scan revealed, as I learned
today, a new abscess in my stomach. What I was not expecting was to be told by my
doctors that they were recommending a new hospital stay of 5-7 days so that I can
receive IV antibiotics (first, they will have to determine what type of infection it is) and
have the abscess drained. Obviously, I was pretty shocked by this news and dismayed by
the thought of another hospital stay. I was initially given the choice between staying in
the hospital here in State College, where I have a large support network, or going back to
Hopkins. In the end, though, it turns out that the local hospital does not have the kind of
specialized personnel that may be needed. So tomorrow it's back to Hopkins. I am very
much hoping that my next chemo infusion on 9/19 will not need to be delayed but that
remains to be seen. If the abscess does not resolve with antibiotics and drainage, a
surgical intervention is possible, in which the abscess would be removed surgically.
The situation sucks, but I'm soldiering on. There's no alternative. I do know that I'll be
getting the best possible care at Hopkins. Thanks, everyone, for keeping me in your
thoughts.",6,surprise,0.9425697,0.0034389088,0.0031182664,0.024778374,0.0028769872,0.010872457,0.012345291,0.9425697

this one “Back to Black,” after a particularly grim song by Amy Winehouse. But since I
tend to be pretty resilient and am in a better place today, I’m calling it, simply, “At
Hopkins,” which reflects the reality of the situation.
                       161 / 1.901
I had what I’m describing to myself as some shade of PTSD-ish symptoms returning to
Weinberg 4B yesterday, after I was admitted to the hospital: flashbacks to 2 a.m.
procedures, having my lung drained of 2 liters of fluid, waking up in the ICU after a
thirteen-hour surgery, and pain, pain. But as soon as I got to my room I was greeted by
Kendall and Delores, two of the outstanding nurses (Kendall) and technicians (Delores)
who took care of me so well last time. They complimented me on my nail color and we
immediately started dishing about my nails and rings. They said I looked great (and
compared to when I was last here in May, I do). Today another favorite nurse, Kris, is
here. She loves the Tait Farm harvest shop in State College so today we talked about
recipes we make with their products! Nurses are extraordinary professionals, and
Hopkins’ are some of the best.
My medical team had a plan in place for me by the time I arrived. I am receiving two
antibiotics via IV drip. A doctor from infectious diseases came to see me and explained
certain things to me very thoroughly (eg how the abscess may have formed). Tomorrow
I’ll meet with doctors from interventional radiology. I may or may not have a drainage
tube placed in my stomach (again) to help drain the abscess, which is smaller than the
last one and in a different location. But they also need to get a culture from the abscess
to find out which more targeted antibiotics I might need. It takes a few days to grow and
test the culture. My blood was tested and thankfully no infection was detected in the
bloodstream.
Beyond that, though, much is uncertain. Can antibiotics (whichever ones I’ll be taking, in
the end) be taken orally, or will they need to be administered solely via IV? This may
have repercussions for how soon I can go home...How long will it take for the abscess to
heal? Will I develop another one? Most importantly (for me), will I be able to have my
next chemo infusion next Thursday, as planned? Will my white blood cell count hold
steady (those cells are fighting both the cancer and the infection at this point)? How long
will I be here? I’m holding out for 5-7 days but none of this seems straightforward. I’m on
the narrow bridge, for sure (or maybe a secondary narrow bridge that is an offshoot of
the primary one). But the most important thing is not to *give in to the fear, not to
despair.*
 
My day was wholly redeemed by a visit from Ben. He took time out of his busy day (he’s
leaving for a business trip tomorrow) to come spend a few hours with me. His hugs and
just his presence made me feel so much better. He is, without doubt, a mensch (and has
had a few excellent models in this area). We had a snack, chatted, and watched sports –
Giants-Cowboys (Ben’s choice), US Open men’s final (my choice). My dear brother,
                       162 / 1.901
Ethan, is also coming from New York tomorrow to spend a few days with me. I asked him
to bring me a raisin bagel from the city.
Getting to sleep was a bit hard last night, anticipating several ‘wake-ups’ throughout the
night. I miss my bed, and my freedom and autonomy. But this is where I need to be now,
and the care I’m receiving is, as usual, first-rate. To fight off insomnia, I
decorated/renovated each room of a fantasy country house and then planned fun social
gatherings there.

48,"I spent a frustrating day yesterday waiting to have a stomach drain placement
procedure. This involved my fasting, in the end, for nearly 24 hours! Around 5 p.m.,
however, one of the gynoc doctors came to my room to tell me that, despite my being on
the schedule, the procedure couldn't take place as planned: interventional radiology had
become too backed up over the course of the day, in part with emergent cases. As a
consequence of waiting all day, however, I was at that point ""higher up in the queue"" for
the next day (ie today). There is so much waiting involved during hospital stays, I've
learned. Fortunately, I am patient but this experience was unnerving.
My recompense was to be taken to interventional radiology for my procedure at 7:30
a.m. today. I was lightly sedated for the short procedure, which went well, and awoke to
find a drainage tube and bag dangling from an incision in my stomach, as I had towards
the end of my hospital stay in May. Not the most pleasant memory. The procedure also
brought some unexpected, and not welcome news: while doing a sonogram during the
procedure, the doctors discovered a fistula or hole/perforation between my bowel and
my stomach. This could actually be the cause of the abscesses I've been developing and
is therefore an important diagnostic piece of information. But the fistula, although
pinpoint sized, has to be repaired, and apparently there are several ways of doing this. I
                       164 / 1.901
do not yet know what the 'plan' is; my surgeon, Dr. Beavis, will consult with
interventional radiology and likely other doctors and come up with something workable,
taking into account the other variables (my chemo timetable, distance that I travel to get
to Baltimore, timing of the two procedures relative to one another etc.). I should know
more tomorrow morning.
Of course I feel frustrated and like I'm 'backsliding.' I feel somewhat deflated by the
'bumps in the road' I've had to deal with, while knowing that chemo treatment is not
always straightforward and can be interrupted by low white blood cell count, infections,
colds etc. I'm committed to staying strong and maintaining a forward-looking attitude.
And the medical team is fully behind me on this. 
I feel badly to put such strain on my mother, brother and Ben. I feel guilty about
generating so much worrisome 'trouble.' I wish it could be otherwise. It's such a drag.
A bright light through all this was the opportunity to spend two days hanging with my
brother, which I rarely if ever get to do. Over the course of many hours, we moved easily
between catching each other up on our lives and kids' lives, and reminiscing about the
penny candy store in Amherst, MA, where we spent a few summers growing up; Auggie's
(as Ethan thinks it was called) was the source of root beer barrels, dots, hot balls and
many other childhood treats. I'm so grateful to Ethan for being here the past few days.
p.s. Dr. Beavis and another doctor came by about 6:30 p.m. and we talked for about an
hour. As she always does, she laid out very clearly the various options and scenarios
regarding repair of the fistula in relation to my chemo. I will know more over the next
few days. This will not be convenient, nor pleasant, and the logistics will be tricky, but it
will hopefully bring me a few steps closer to healing and should also not compromise my
chemo schedule significantly, which is the most important thing. I felt better after
speaking with them.",0,anger,0.53771895,0.53771895,0.0063455408,0.39650154,0.0015466495,0.006154162,0.023310404,0.028422637
49,"After a week here, I am being discharged tomorrow! Dr. Beavis, in consultation with
several other doctors (Mehta, the infectious disease specialist; Patel, my oncologist in
State College; Lyons, the interventional radiologist; and Stone, another gynoc surgeon
who told Beavis she had had a patient who presented a case similar to mine), developed
a new (or revised plan): the fistula will not be actively attended to until I finish my final
round of chemo. The reasoning is that I should be 'covered' between the two antibiotics
I'll be taking daily through IV (micafungin and Invanz) and the tube that is draining the
abscess in my stomach. This means, of course, that I'll be back to self-administering the
antibiotics and draining the abscess daily, for the next ten week. This is time-consuming
and laborious but I'LL TAKE IT. Hopefully, the fistula might close on its own. Conversely,
it could also get bigger (but hopefully will not). If it's not resolved by the time I finish
chemo, I may well need a procedure in which a small plug is inserted subcutaneously
into the fistula, to close it. The other option would be a more invasive surgery, which I
definitely want to avoid. Fortunately, my next chemo treatment will only be delayed four
days, until Sept. 23rd and should not interfere with my Rosh Hashana plans. All in all,
then, I think this is a very good outcome, especially as I can have my next chemo
infusion a week from Monday.
As usual, Dr. Beavis was thoroughly on top of the situation, coordinating its different
parts into a well-thought out plan. She is thorough and careful, smart, empathic and
upbeat. She also spent about an hour with me two evenings ago and half an hour or so
today, in my room, explaining all angles of the plan clearly and answering my questions.
I continue to feel grateful for my great good fortune in being under her care.
I find being in the hospital difficult. While hospitals are places where miraculous
developments occur, where people are cared for, survive and thrive, and show great
strength of spirit even in their weakness and vulnerability, on my worst days I felt the
prison analogy -- loss of freedom and autonomy, restrictions and constraints, lack of
                       168 / 1.901
comfort, separation from the 'real world' -- more appropriate. I find it hard sometimes to
keep my spirits up, although the nurses are all extremely kind and skillful, and texts and
notes from friends certainly helped (not to mention visits from Ben and my brother
Ethan). I do not mean to sound ungrateful as I feel unbelievably fortunate for the care
I'm receiving, and usually manage to remain chipper. Yet I will be so relieved to be home
tomorrow and certainly hope there will be no cause for another trip here before my next
scheduled appointments on on Oct. 22nd.
I did distract myself by plunging into an excellent book that my reading group will be
taking up next week (happily, I should be able to make that meeting after missing a
couple of previous ones): _Educated_ by Tara Westover (an astonishing memoir about a
young woman's struggle to craft a new identity following a highly singular upbringing in
a survivalist family in rural Idaho). I also welcomed visits from Rhonda, a wonderful
chaplain here. I believe she's a Methodist pastor but her approach is ecumenical. We
joined in prayers for healing and for tomorrow's travel, extending them over my 'loving
family,' friends and colleagues. It felt very cathartic, a bit of release during a difficult
week.
I have fallen behind in responding to emails this week - did not feel up to it or was
distracted by procedures and doctors' visits. Hope to respond as soon as I'm able.
Sincere thanks to friends, family and colleagues who took the time to write. Hopefully
you'll next hear from me in State College. I am bummed to be missing the ovarian
cancer survivorship conference here on Saturday, but it's logistically tricky for me to stay
here for that -- and I'm eager to get home.",3,joy,0.4523604,0.0077971537,0.012857138,0.011408068,0.4523604,0.11124061,0.37745443,0.026882254

I'm immensely relieved to be back home after a week in the hospital. While I'm sincerely
grateful for the care I received at Hopkins, and while it was hugs all around with Kendall,
Lynne and some of the other wonderful nurses in Weinberg 4B when I left yesterday (see
pic), the hospital stays are wearing emotionally and psychologically. They are, simply,
hard. The ride back to State College took much longer than usual, due to a combination
of Friday rush hour traffic, construction and what seemed to be some traffic in advance
of the PSU-Pitt game today.
I went to bed around 11 p.m.and slept until 11:15 a.m! Such a relief not to be woken
throughout the night to have vitals taken, medicines changed in the drip, and to talk to
the doctors on their rounds (usually at 6 a.m.). While the game was going on this
afternoon, I took advantage of the quiet in town and drove to Wegman's, where I bought
the 'fixings' to make chicken soup with matzah balls, to get a start on my Rosh Hashanah
cooking. Nothing screams 'home,' 'comfort,' and 'zen' to me more than chicken soup, so
I'm going to dump the chicken, carrots, celery, leeks, parsnips, onion, turnips, parsley,
garlic, ginger, peppercorns, cloves, salt etc. in a big pot tomorrow and let it simmer
throughout the day. I'll likely reserve a bowl for myself and save the rest for the holiday.
Yum.
I will definitely be needing some extra measures of Patience and Fortitude (incidentally,
the names of the two lions at the entrance to the New York Public Library) to deal with all
the meds I will be administering to myself for the next ten weeks: I flush and drain my
stomach tube twice a day (it's currently hurting me at the insertion site but I hope that
will abate), then change the gauze dressing, and administer two different antibiotics
through an IV drip, using a different system than the one I used before. Am also taking
eight potassium pills a day, in addition to other medications. I can think of a million other
things I'd rather be doing and hope that this is not all screaming 'invalid.' Need to keep
my spirit strong and focus on my core vitality. All this laboriousness will be worth it,
though, if it gets me through the final three rounds of chemo. Fingers firmly crossed.
If all goes as planned, my next trip to Hopkins is scheduled for Oct. 22. I always welcome
rides there, to relieve some of my dependence on the car service I've been using as I
don't feel up to making that longish drive myself. Please let me know if you know anyone
who might help with this.
Thank you for your comments on my posts. They are all meaningful and encouraging to
me, and I'm sorry I'm unable to respond to each one.
While I was in the hospital the leaves started changing color and falling. I can't wait to
take walks and drives on these mellow days. Fall is my favorite season.

51,"As challenging as it is adjusting to a hospital stay, returning home can be difficult too.
The rhythms, schedules, faces and spaces are so radically different. I tried to preserve
some sense of 'normalcy' in the hospital this time by wearing my own clothes (as
opposed to a gown), including sleeping in my own p.j.s. And I've attempted to get back
to normal since I've been back by repeating familiar gestures -- making chicken soup,
grocery shopping, taking walks in the beautiful weather and reading by Spring Creek.
It's been quiet here since I've been back. I have to spend an inordinate amount of time
flushing, draining, administering antibiotics, changing dressings, and taking medication.
It's frustrating and boring, but if this is what is needed to enable me to claw my way over
the finish line with chemo in early November, I'm in for sure. I'm already nervous that
the fistula (hole) between my bowel and my stomach that was detected in my last CT
scan might get bigger and result in sepsis, which would of course be dire (on the other
hand, the hole is microscopic and may heal on its own; the doctors will attend to it once
                       174 / 1.901
chemo is done). And I think the doctors may have decided not to give me another chemo
drug that might help me, Avastin, because of the stomach infection issues. So I really
have to hope and pray for the best result over the next ten weeks or so, and must
believe that my treatment is not being compromised in any significant way.
In more encouraging news, I actually feel better! The impetus for this last hospitalization
was my stomach feeling out of whack - I hardly had any appetite, and it felt as if my food
was not being digested properly -- perhaps a result of the abscess. The past few days
I've had what might pass as a hearty appetite, and I can taste my food! At lunch today at
the Ale House with my friend Kathryn, I consumed my Thai chicken salad with gusto and
treated myself to a mid-afternoon ice cream cone yesterday. I'll take it.
I'm trying to arrange lunches, coffees, and other outings with friends but feel a bit
isolated. People are working, busy with school - it's understandable. I'm generally ok with
alone time and also have some small projects to work on. But sometimes the silence is a
bit much for my fundamentally extroverted self. Happily, my mother and son will be
coming to State College for Rosh Hashanah next week, which I look forward to spending
with them, my congregation and other friends. Such a hopeful holiday, with its message
of renewal.
Finally, a very dear friend whom I've known since grade school has offered to drive me to
my next appointment at Hopkins! She lives in CA but may be coming here from NY. We
are working out the details but I am so touched by this act of friendship. Of my grade
school friends (32 of us graduated together from our Grade 1-12 school), at least five if
not more are following my page and showing extraordinary love and solidarity dating

the IV antibiotics and the drain. Consequently, I've had no stomach pain and I do have an
appetite (which will undoubtedly disappear for a few days after chemo this Monday).
All this made for a comparatively 'normal' week, for which I'm immensely grateful, as I
am for the beautiful mellow end of summer weather. I pushed myself to walk a good two-
mile loop in a nearby park and will try to build on that (because I still don't have a huge
amount of stamina, I usually have to rest for a while after such an exertion, which of
course would not have winded me at all pre-cancer). I returned to my book group after
about a four-month hiatus due to my health situation: smart, interesting women, wine
(none for me, alas) and cheese in abundance; and a spirited discussion of Tara
Westover's _Educated._ I spent a good 5-6 hours on campus yesterday, first meeting
with a graduate student whose dissertation I direct; then attending the dissertation
defense of a student with whom I've worked closely over the years and of whom I'm very
fond; and finally attending the post-defense reception. It felt great to be back 'in the mix'
temporarily, within the cocoon of our wonderfully supportive and intellectually sharp
department. Several students and colleagues told me how much I am missed, which was
touching. I spend likely too much time these days torn between worrying if I'll be ready
                       176 / 1.901
to tackle the demands of my job in January (right now, my body needs *a lot* of sleep)
and very much missing my professional life and the people who make it so rewarding.
One day at a time. I was also able to do a large shop at Wegman's for Rosh Hashanah
dishes I hope to make in the next few days (honey cake, kugel, matzah balls) and then
I'll do a second shop this week for the rest (brisket, tsimmes, chopped liver, a compote of
some kind).
My friend Katarina and I enjoyed a coffee on the porch of Cafe Lemont, in the sun. Her
parents live in Israel and are visiting now. They kindly brought me a beautiful hamsa to
be hung on the wall inscribed with a prayer for healing (including a prayer for
*caregivers,* who are often also in need of healing). They took the hamsa to the kotel
(Western Wall) and said a prayer over it there. They also brought me a very delicate
hamsa pendant, with silver filigree. So very thoughtful.
I am praying that my chemo infusion goes well on Monday. Specifically, I dread a repeat
of last time, when the chemo either triggered or aggravated a stomach abscess. I am
praying that this time I am 'covered,' but I don't think having chemo while being treated
for an infection is ideal. I want to be well for the holiday, and hope that I'll be feeling
better by Friday. Please send good thoughts my way. I will have a visitor (or two or
three) to keep me company at least part of the time and will try to stay calm.",3,joy,0.51517344,0.00276184,0.0025146387,0.0026367437,0.51517344,0.06061547,0.39314866,0.023149213
53,"Four down, two to go! Everything went smoothly this morning. My kind neighbor Janis
drove me to (and from) the Geisinger facility where I receive chemo (a convenient ten-
minute drive from my house). I had blood drawn, vitals taken, and then met with Dr.
Patel, my oncologist. My blood work looked fine, thankfully. He confirmed that I will not
be given Avastin because it might aggravate/cause a fistula, like the one I have now,
which will need to be attended to after my treatment is finished. He said it was fairly
uncommon for patients to receive chemo while also attending to an infection such as
mine, but I simply have to be hopeful that I can get through these final three treatments
without a setback.

As I've mentioned before, the likelihood of a recurrence with ovarian cancer is quite high,
so I may not be done with chemo (nor surgery) after these six rounds are over. A
recurrence could happen after several months, a year, two years, or in a minority of
cases, never. At the risk of sounding like a broken record: one day at a time.
I was infused from about 9:00 to 2:30. It is pretty straightforward. No raving Trump
supporters this time, although the place was full. I wish it had windows. Around noon, a
new friend, Jackie (one of the ""III Cs"" I've recently met) came to visit, bearing the now
traditional vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy (delicious). Jackie (who is Scottish) is
delightful, interesting, active, youthful (at 73) and very kind. Her visit, and her long-term
survival, were both very cheering. Otherwise, I was engrossed in an excellent book I'm
reading for next month's book group, _Where the Crawdads Sing._ The drip doesn't hurt,
the nurses are solicitous and skillful, and once I get into a zone, the time passes fairly
quickly. Like much else on this journey, what initially seemed daunting or frightening has
now been normalized to some extent.
I got home around 3:00, took a nap, then made a big lokshen (noodle) kugel for Sunday's
holiday meal - sweet foods for a sweet new year. Cooking will continue throughout the
week, in between the home treatments, reading, working on some small projects,
emails, walks etc. Anticipating a brutal W-TH post-chemo crash, but hopefully not as bad
as last time.

the day today. No pronounced nausea but body aches. Mainly crushing fatigue that I
have no choice but to succumb to. Of course, it's disorienting and depressing, especially
on a beautiful day, but at least I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to take care of
myself. Fortunately, no stomach ache so far - fingers crossed. I'm out of bed now, read a

55,"Today is the birthday of the world, Jewish tradition teaches, a time of renewal and hope
for the year ahead. We've fully entered the month of elul, which coincides with early
autumn, and the ""Days of Awe:"" Rosh Hashanah, on which our fate for the new year is
written, and Yom Kippur, on which it is is sealed. Our lives are depicted as being in the
balance during these days before the 'gates close:' ""who shall live to a ripe old age and
who shall lie dying on a bed of pain?"" It's an existential state; we're truly 'on the narrow
bridge.' We beat our chests as we catalog the sins that we've been guilty of the past
year. Yet we are told that teshuvah (repentence or return), tefillah (prayer) and tzedakah
(charity) can temper the harshness of God's decree.
Having had to confront my own mortality over the past few months, the spiritual side of
my journey has come into fuller relief, including during the holidays. I'll welcome the
opportunity at dinner tonight, while blessing a round challah, symbol of the cycle of life,
and later at services, to tap into feelings of hopefulness, renewal, and immanence. To

Emily Dickinson, hope is ""the thing with feathers-/That perches in the soul-"" that can be
heard in ""the chillest land-/And on the strangest Sea-"" I've indeed felt glimmers of hope
in the 'chillest land' and 'strangest Sea' where I've found myself struggling over the past
few months. As for my fate, it surely lies somewhere at the intersection of the designs of
some nasty, aggressive, microscopic cancer cells, the skills of my medical team, and my
own fighting spirit. 
I am spiritual, yet agnostic. I apologize if this offends any believers who may be reading
this. But I do firmly believe in the manifestation of 'godly' qualities in people, animals,
and nature, whether it be loving kindness, graciousness, mercifulness, or compassion. I
have seen these attributes displayed time and time again since my diagnosis, whether
through friends coming to spend time with me, text or call me, send me thoughtful gifts,
volunteer to do errands for me, cook for me, drive me to Baltimore, or just 'hold space'
for me. It is quite wondrous. 
It is a wonderful holiday this year because my mother and Ben are here. My mother and I
have been cooking up a storm; I'm not quite sure how I managed to pull it off as at the
beginning of the week I was completely wiped out from chemo, but I was searing brisket
and frying onions in pomegranate molasses early this morning. I was hoping that Ben
might take some interest in the holiday cooking (he certainly does in the eating), as I'm
not sure who will continue the culinary traditions after my mother and me. 
Mitchel and Paula, I will be in touch w/you soon. I am catching up on other emails. The
week started out as a 'week from hell' but it's ending on a much better note. Sending

Gray skies and chilly temps today presage fall, not the autumn of ""mellow fruitfulness"" but the
""season of mists"" that can tend to make me feel gloomy and isolated. I turned the heat on for the first
time. I also slept a good part of the day, which always annoys me as I feel that I should be up and
about, being productive. I suppose I need to 'listen to my body.' My stomach has also been feeling a
bit 'cranky' and achy the past few days, although it often doesn't feel quite right. Always hard to know
if it's 'something' or 'nothing.' Because of my recent history of stomach abscesses, the last one
necessitating an unexpected week-long hospitalization, I tend to project a lot of anxiety onto my body,
and am now also fully aware of the perils of *late* detection. On the other hand, if I ignore whatever
seems to be a bit 'off' with my stomach, I will be assured of receiving chemo on the 14th, which is the
ultimate goal. So it's an abundance of caution v. potentially magical thinking. I am inclined to write to
my medical team tomorrow to let them know about the symptoms and see if they'd like me to have a
scan done here next week (I will definitely be having a scan between rounds 5 and 6).
I may be tired because of all the activity around the holiday, which nevertheless was lovely. It was
comforting having my mother and Ben here, and we enjoyed dipping apple slices in honey and
observing other holiday rituals. I sauteed fresh spinach from Tait Farm in delicious olive oil from
southern France that came to me in a stupendous 'goodie box' from my dear college friend Mitchel,
full of both culinary products (honey, chocolate, tapenade, olives) and perfumed items from
Fragonard, all from around Nice, where he's lived for many years. I am not used to being pampered
this way, and I was very touched! I managed to pull off a big multicourse meal, as I love to do, but by
the end I was really tired and my mother and Ben had to help serve/clean up. Michael and Sue had a
party after services on Monday, where I was able to catch up with some other friends over bagels and
lox. That gathering bumped up right against the tashlich service, and so I didn't make it there this
year.
Many friends and acquaintances whom I saw at services extended wishes for my return to good
health - kind of them. Despite what I wrote in my last post, I too was praying pretty hard to be
inscribed for a healthy and peaceful year (w/that prayer extended to all my family and friends).
Things continue to be pretty....quiet. I did attend a lecture on campus by the political commentator
Andrew Sullivan (whom I've been reading since his _New Republic_ days), on ""Democracy in the Age
of Trump."" Fascinating lecture with a grim message (basically: we're screwed). Also read another
book I greatly enjoyed, _Where the Crawdads Sing_ by Delia Owens. Happily, I have a book party to
attend tomorrow and a few get-togethers with friends planned (and welcome even more), but my
voracious social (and physical) energy are definitely down a few notches right now. Hopefully, they'll
be back before too long.

57,"In another strange twist on 'nothing is predictable anymore,' I had an active day on
Saturday -- farmers' market, shopping at Wegmans, scenic drive to Brush Valley, with its
big swaths of farmland, produce stands and Amish buggies, soup making (veggie this
week: green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, leeks, carrots, corn). I was so tired (or out of
sorts?) on Sunday, though, that I slept most of the day, which is very disorienting.
Cold, rainy weather set in on Sunday and Monday, which, in addition to darkness arriving
earlier each day, contributed to my gloomy spirits and feelings of isolation. I found
myself venturing to morbid places I try hard not to enter -- wondering whether cancer is
trying to make quick business out of me, pondering the particular aggressiveness of my
form of the disease (which Dr. Beavis tried to explain to me very clearly but which I'm
                       197 / 1.901
still not sure I absorbed entirely), wondering what might be going on in my body right
now to cause me some stomach discomfort and questioning whether additional imaging
should be done before my next chemo on Monday. On that note, I am going to see Dr.
Patel tomorrow so he can examine me and determine whether imaging is desirable (on
the upside, my appetite is healthy and I have no fever). There are days when I definitely
need a few extra measures of grace to handle my health challenge.
Spending time with friends/acquaintances helped get me out of my funk. A very nice
acquaintance from synagogue, Deena, picked me up for a ""life is short, eat dessert first""
date at the Creamery, where half a tuna sandwich each was just an excuse for the
gigantic ice cream cones each of us indulged in after that. This morning Gay and I had
one of our ritual breakfasts at the Waffle Shop (mini-platter for me...); I reveled in the
'normalcy' of such a get-together. Friends and family are usually my lifeline in glum
moments, so I very much appreciated these get-togethers (plus other texts and emails
this week).
I'll go to Kol Nidre tonight and services tomorrow (for most of the day). Although I usually
fast on Yom Kippur, I will have to forego that this year. My doctor thinks there is too
much risk of dehydration, which would put strain on my kidneys and imperil my chemo
treatment. I wish I had more control over whether I'll be *sealed* in the Book of Life for
another year but only part of the outcome is in my hands, in the form of self-care,
attitude, being proactive with my treatment etc. I'm not sure how this realization makes
me feel. Wishing everyone who observes an easy fast and a good ""sealing"" for a year of
health, happiness and peace.",5,sadness,0.9578903,0.0007968051,0.0035020057,0.005092834,0.00960782,0.014574226,0.9578903,0.008536

As I was walking to Yom Kippur services Wednesday on a brilliantly sunny autumn
morning, the sun highlighting all the beautiful leaf tones of green, yellow, gold and red, I
said to myself: ""Next year on Yom Kippur morning I want to be doing exactly the same
thing I'm doing today."" I suppose that passes as my prayer to be inscribed in the Book of
Life for another year.
I found an interesting meditation on the Reform Judaism website for 'one who cannot
fast.' Apparently, Judaism proscribes fasting for those under thirteen, pregnant women,
and those who are ill. My oncologist was wary of my fasting, as I most always do on YK,
because I need the hydration. So instead of fasting I reflected on this excerpt from a
longer meditation:
You know, dear God, that it is not my intent
to be apart from our people and our tradition.
My current state of health makes it unsuitable for me to fast
So, dear God, I turn to You now in sincerity and openness:
Help me in the coming year to do my best in guarding my health.
Help us, Your children, learn how to protect our bodies from harm.
Help us support others in caring for their , their Image of God.
Teach us to help one another grow and thrive in Body, Mind, and Spirit.
Guide caring family and health care professionals in their partnering with you
to bring healing if not cure, support and strength if not an end to symptoms.
And if there is an opportunity for me to help others who suffer
by doing something they need or by being attentive company —
Grant me the ability to do this mitzvah with love and devotion. 
The spirit of compassion, community and connection seemed to move several members of my
congregation to reach out to me, very kindly, with renewed offers of rides, meals, errands etc. I
was quite touched. I also received two spontaneous chicken soup deliveries! I am well-stocked
with soup to get me through Monday's chemo and its aftermath.
During a break in services I ran over to my oncologist's office to get his take on whether he felt
I might be 'brewing' another stomach abscess. He pressed on some tender areas near the
drain insertion point but felt that it was minor inflammation and nothing to be concerned about.
Whereas Dr. Mehta (infectious disease specialist) at Hopkins felt that I should definitely have a
CT scan, Dr. Patel (oncologist) seemed confident that chemo could proceed on Monday. Who
is right?? I noted that in today's blood work my red blood count is rather low, and I hope that
that -- or anything else -- does not interfere with chemo. I am anxious. I'll have at least one
friend, Jackie (one of the 'III Cs'), visit with me for a little while. I'm prepared for a wretched
                       202 / 1.901
couple of days post-chemo but maybe I'll be surprised.
As a friend pointed out in passing recently, I inhabit a strange space between 'normalcy' (or
some semblance of it) and its complete opposite. I am grateful for the 'normalcy' of a lovely
lunch with my friend Kathryn; morning coffee with my friend Clare; dinner and catch-up with my
friend Maria; and a good chat with my friend Helen while basking in the late afternoon sun in
the arboretum, decorated with gorgeous seasonal displays of gourds and pumpkins. Far less
normal, or rather the 'new normal,' are two hours' worth of infusions per day, twice daily
drainings of my stomach abscess, nurse visits to change my port, and managing peoples'
reactions to my cancer news. It's sometimes hard to navigate life in these 'two worlds...'

for a not too awful aftermath.",2,fear,0.655718,0.011412048,0.008200568,0.655718,0.17801043,0.118534885,0.018917099,0.009206978
59,"My infusion went smoothly today. Happily, my blood counts were in the normal-ish
range. My liver function was a bit elevated but Dr. Patel said that it's because it's
working 'overtime' now to process the various drugs in my system.
I was at Dr. Patel's office from 8:15 to 2:15 and even dozed a bit this time, wrapped up in
a blanket, as I didn't sleep much last night and was also given Benadryl before the
chemo drugs. No ranters this time, thankfully, but rather several skilled, calm and
solicitous nurses. Four angels (in addition to the nurses) brightened my day. My friend
Gay picked me up at home bright and early (dropping off some homemade chili and also 
pumpkin pie for the Canadian Thanksgiving she's observing today), and stayed with me
for the first hour of my infusion. At around eleven, Jackie -- one of the ""III Cs"" and a lovely
person -- stopped by with the now traditional vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy. A mild
cold prevented her from staying with me as planned, but she blew me a big kiss.
Sometime in the early afternoon (I was snoozing), Rhonda, my mentor from the Hopkins
Woman to Woman program who lives in nearby Lewistown, stopped by to visit briefly.
We had a great talk about how to stay positive and keep going despite all the
uncertainty and legitimate reason for sadness and depression (which it is also important
to acknowledge, but not wallow in). That talk did me a lot of good. Finally, when I was
done my kind next-door neighbor Janis was waiting outside to take me home. We talked
about her losing a five-year-old son to cancer -- something I had not known --and how
she managed to get through that. She was gracious to confide in me that way. I was
tired on my return so I rested for a while. Sorry to have missed the glorious weather
today but I may be able to catch more of it tomorrow. Thanks so much to friends and
family who sent texts and emails today- I'm feeling the love!
My last chemo infusion in this series is on Nov. 4th. It is unclear what will happen after
                       204 / 1.901
that. I will need to have the fistula repaired at Hopkins. Much will depend on the result of
the scan I will have on October 22nd, also at Hopkins. This will reveal a lot about how
successful the treatment has been. In this context, I have mentioned the CA125 marker,
an ovarian tumor marker that is normally supposed to go down as treatment continues.
In July, after surgery, my marker was 164.5, which is considered high. For the next three
treatments, to my surprise and even annoyance, Dr. Patel did not request that the
CA125 marker be included in my blood work, so *there is no data for those three
treatments.* As mentioned in an earlier post, he does not want me to get fixated on the
number, as the scan is the most revelatory indicator of progress and as, as he said to
me, ""I still need to treat you no matter what."" I still think, though, as a patient it is my
right to know this information. But now I won't. Oh well. 
Today's CA125 number is 57.4. It's dropped a good deal but is still listed as high. The
normal range is considered 1-30 (I note that in August 2017, way before I was ever
diagnosed with cancer, my number was 4.6). So the good news is that the number has
dropped significantly (Dr. Patel seemed to think so), and perhaps will drop even more
next time. But as predicted, the fact that it's still considered a bit high is causing me
anxiety in terms of what follow-up treatment I will need (More chemo? Parp inhibitors?
More surgery? None of the above)? I will know more after I have my scan and discuss
with Dr. Beavis. So for now, one day at a time. The whole world is a narrow bridge, but
the most important thing is not to give in to despair. These mantras still work for me.

my case, sleeping, as I have for the better part of the past two days. Of course I am
beating myself up for feeling slothful, listless, unproductive and the opposite of vibrant,
but unfortunately there is no alternative in this case to simply...succumbing, while the
chemo drugs work their way through my system (hopefully killing lots of cancer cells
along the way). I have no more than mild nausea, no vomiting, a mild upset stomach,
some mildly puffy glands-- but mainly crushing fatigue, which makes it challenging to do

61,"Writing from the ER at Mount Nittany Medical Center where I’ve spent a mind-numbing
eight hours or so. This morning, the visiting nurse who came to deaccess my port
thought the discharge from my drainage site looked disconcerting and advised I go to
the ER. I had also discussed this possibility, by phone, the night before with an infectious
diseases doctor filling in for Dr. Mehta. So I headed to the ER around 1:30, knowing that
I’d likely be stuck there for hours. To make a llloong story short (partly because I’m
typing on my iPhone), I had bloodwork and cultures done (sepsis is always a worry...),
followed by a CT scan. Then the ER doctor here, who seemed quite competent, conferred
by phone with the infectious diseases doctor at Hopkins. They decided that they should
keep me here in the hospital for a night or two to make sure nothing untoward happens
with the infection. My heart rate was also high when I got to the hospital and my blood
pressure was low; I didn’t feel great.
So here I am. I’m praying I can go home tomorrow. I’m a bit weepy but am just trying to
get through this short-term situation. And probably best to err on the side of caution.
While the standard of care seems adequate here, and the staff has been kind, it can’t
compare to the world-class care I receive at Hopkins. Also, nary a brown or black face
here; welcome to central PA...
It’s been one of those days when I hope I’m not becoming my disease, a mass of
unpleasantness. How I would have liked to be striding through big piles of leaves today,

only to be unleashed into the zany traffic patterns around the stadium (holding over
110.000 last night), as the game had just started (I caught the final three quarters at
home). It would have been preferable for someone to have picked me up at the hospital,
but with the game traffic that was not feasible.
I am feeling better today, freshly pumped with two units of blood due to my
disconcertingly low hemoglobin count. Of course, this wasn't what had initially brought
me to the ER, ie some suspicious looking discharge from my stomach drainage site. In
the end, though, from what the the doctors told me, this should not be a cause for
concern. But straight lines and clear-cut solutions are infrequent in this journey.
My weepiness yesterday morning at feeling isolated and caught off guard, missing a
beautiful day etc. didn't seem to resonate with the nurses. But I got myself out of my
funk, partly by visualizing scenes from Ben's birth at the same hospital nearly twenty-
five years earlier. Kathryn and Bénédicte, two dear friends who are also my colleagues,
brought good cheer and culture high (_The Economist_) and low (_People Magazine_)
when they visited me.
In dozens of ways I noted throughout my 30 or so hour experience, the care at MNMC is
way below that at Hopkins, not surprisingly, although I'm grateful to the staff for its care,
and the ER doc was sharp. Lesson to self: always try to target best health care providers,
if possible (given the real real concerns regarding insurance etc.). Also: if you can, give
blood. Much gratitude towards whomever donated the blood that reinvigorated my
chemo-depleted hemoglobin last night.
I will go to see Dr. Patel tomorrow morning at 9 for more tests. Unclear yet whether I'll
be going to Hopkins on Tuesday to see Dr. Beavis for a consult, as scheduled, or not (we
may postpone until after my final round of chemo at which point I'll have a scan).

Perhaps my 'reward' for last weekend's depressing hospital stay was a wonderful,
uplifting visit from my high school friend, Jill, who arrived on Monday afternoon and left
Wednesday morning. Jill lives in Calabasas, CA but is often on the east coast visiting her
daughters in NY and Princeton, NJ. When she learned that I had to go to Hopkins on the

drive me to Baltimore and back! As it turns out, though, my appointment yesterday at
Hopkins wound up being rescheduled until Nov. 19th. Dr. Beavis felt that since I had just
been hospitalized and am feeling better from having had a blood transfusion, and since
two CT scans here in State College revealed that my stomach drain is still correctly
placed and functioning fine, we could forego this appointment, which was going to be a
consultation with no procedures involved. On Nov. 19th, I will have a post-chemo scan to
see whether there is still evidence of disease (fingers crossed). We'll also talk about the
rest of the treatment plan going forward, including repairing the fistula if it has not
closed on its own.
So our girls' road trip to Balto turned into a relaxing catch up visit here in State College. I
last saw Jill about 2-3 years ago (?) at a memorial event for one of our classmates. As our
graduating class consisted of *23* young women, most of us are still in touch (in fact,
more and more so as the years pass and thanks to social media; I know that several are
kind enough to follow this journal). Jill was one of my closest friends in high school,
having arrived at Nightingale-Bamford (our school) in 9th grade, unlike most of us who
had entered in first or, in my case, second grade. Jill and I remained in touch over the
years via birthday cards and Facebook, but have only really reconnected in person in the
past few years.
A (Jewish) New Yorker after my own heart, Jill came bearing 'the good stuff' from the city:
a large container of chicken soup from the 2nd Avenue Deli (accompanied by two large,
fluffy, schmaltzy matzah balls), walnut pumpernickel from Orwasher's bakery -- like a
Proustian madeleine for me, as one bite sent me back to my grandmother's townhouse
on E. 94th street where, when I visited her after school, we'd eat Orwasher's raisin
pumpernickel slathered in butter, accompanied by...Kahlua!; and a box of delicious
cookies (palmiers, hamentashen, black and white, macaroons), also from Orwasher's.
There was no end to the catching up and reminiscing (we tried to recreate in detail the
apartments of each of our classmates, while recalling the quirks of their parents and
siblings), with plenty of time to take stock of the present (aging parents, twenty-
something children, insurance plans). With great sensitivity, Jill gave me plenty of space
to talk about my cancer if I felt like it; it turned out that I didn't feel I needed a lot of
room to do so, beyond acknowledging the challenge of balancing a tough diagnosis and
treatment with a strong will to live my life, the best one possible. It poured all day
yesterday, but between the raindrops we managed to sneak out for a coffee/tea at Cafe
                       216 / 1.901
Lemont and a quick trip to the farmers' market, followed by a rainy drive around town
and campus (complete with the requisite photo-op by the Nittany Lion shrine) and dinner
at Barrel 21.
I had been telling my therapist the other day that I don't laugh very much these days
(kinda sad to think that, but it turns out that cancer isn't that hilarious after all), so I very
much appreciated all the smiles and laughter Jill's visit elicited, in addition to her
'positivity' (for lack of a better term) around my illness (stressing how well I looked and
strong I seemed, etc.) . It was all therapeutic, and I've been feeling pretty well the past
few days (with an appetite, too).
After Jill left, I got back into bed and slept a bit longer (still need a lot of sleep...), then
took a drive out a pretty country road to admire the foliage on this beautiful sunny day.
The leaves looked like golden glitter with the sun streaming through them. No buggies
today, but a laid-back general store in Spring Mills, PA, and lots of pick-up trucks.
Grateful for the balm of friendship.

There is not too much to report. I am generally feeling well. The further removed I am
from chemo, the better I feel. But the closer I get to the next round of chemo, the more
anxious I become. So I'm sort of on that cusp right now. I feel relieved that Monday will
be my last round of chemo, perhaps warranting a small celebration of sorts. But I feel
uneasy anticipating the scan I'll have at Hopkins on 11/19, which will reveal if the
treatment's been effective and I've gone into remission. Nothing on this journey is
straightforward. Sigh.
My thoughtful sis-in-law, Ronit, texted me the other day to say she was thinking of me
and to wish me well (much appreciated). She wrote that she hoped I was enjoying some
'easy pleasures,' despite the dreariness of my medical situation. This seemed not only a
kind wish but good advice too. I've been trying to milk a lot of enjoyment out of easy
pleasures, ones that are within my control (it turns out there are many), including coffee
at our local second hand bookshop/coffee shop w/my friend Clare; farmers market with
my friend Maria and her son (and my former student) Anthony; a delicious dinner
marking Diwali at a local Indian restaurant, with lots of special dishes, also with Maria; a
nice visit from my friend Helen, w/whom I have a lunch date tomorrow at a local hole in
the wall Mexican place that serves great food! It is true that my 'easy pleasures' often
involve friends and food (and right now my appetite seems to be back with a
vengeance). I also enjoyed a long walk in the mellow sun today; my favorite ginkgo trees
have turned yellow, others are brilliant red...
I had a strange dream in which I was drunk on champagne. I was drinking unfinished half-
glasses in some sort of hotel or banquet hall, dressed in a ball gown [?], waiting for a
party to start [?]. Meanwhile, in reality I've had about a half a glass of wine since May!
Then, I began walking through the public spaces in the hotel singing loudly with abandon
to anyone who would listen the first verse of ""Tracks of my Tears"" by Smokey Robinson
and the Miracles: ""People say I'm the life of the party/Cause I tell a joke or two/You know
I'm not really laughing loud and hearty/Deep inside I'm blue/So take a good look at my
face/You know my smile seems out of place/If you look closer it's easy to trace/The
tracks of my tears."" Somehow this resonated with an image I saw on an ovarian cancer
support group page today (see pic). I don't normally feel this 'blue' 'deep inside' (or
rather, that feeling has abated since May as I have settled into the 'new normal' and
have proved myself pretty resilient) but perhaps the song and image tapped into a once
in a while feeling, or one that's buried away from my everyday consciousness.
My rabbi was in another dream, in a protective, nurturing (of me) role. He was sort of a
caretaker. The same dream also featured, I believe, Ben and another boy as little boys,
with me in the caretaker role. That's all I remember.
My friend Mary made me some delicious soup with chick peas, garlic, Parmesan cheese
                       223 / 1.901
and I can't tell what else and I look forward to enjoying it for dinner. I bought fixings for
carrot soup (w/miso and ginger) at the farmers market. Maybe a project for tomorrow.",3,joy,0.73929423,0.003089575,0.0035183232,0.022599068,0.73929423,0.031429946,0.1858868,0.014182101
65,"I just returned from getting a flu shot and the first of two pneumonia shots. My PCP
(Primary Care Provider), Dr. Damaske, wrote me and encouraged me to get both to make
sure to protect my immune system through the winter. While the nurse was giving me
the shots in an examination room, Dr. Damaske stopped by to say hello. We really had
not been in contact since my initial diagnosis in April, as he's taken the back seat to the
Hopkins team and Dr. Patel in State College. Yet he's been a caring, concerned,
sympathetic presence all along (he had given me his personal cell number for me to use
as needed), and I was touched by his taking the time to chat with me about how I'm
doing.
The town cancelled trick or treating tonight because of a tornado watch! It's been rainy,
gray and chilly all day, with strong gusts of wind whipping up the leaves -- weather
appropriate for Halloween or tomorrow's Day of the Dead (All Souls'/Toussaint).
Unfortunately, I ate a lot of the chocolate I had bought for the trick or treaters so I'll have
to get some more (although kids rarely seem to come around this neighborhood, and not
many live here).
Rather than wallowing in the late October gloom right now, I'd rather be at a conference
I often go to, in sunny Sarasota. Granted, I didn't send in a proposal for this conference
this year (as I now most often gravitate towards history conferences), but many
delightful friends/colleagues are there and the pictures now being posted on Facebook
reveal a lovely venue, colleagues drinking cocktails at a rooftop bar, research being
shared, conversations and laughter etc. Once again that feeling of being sidelined and
wondering how and when I will be able to jumpstart my professional life. It feels like I've
lived a whole other, alternate life in the meanwhile.
In much happier news, this weekend two of my graduate school bffs, Shanny and
Isabelle, will be driving out from New York to visit me! I very much look forward to seeing
these two dear 'filles' (as we've always called each other) for a few days of hanging,
cooking, reminiscing, laughing riotously, sharing. dancing (Shanny's request!) and more.
And the visit's perfectly timed to keep my mind off my *last* chemo treatment this
coming Monday.

I finished my last of six rounds of chemo today. Over the course of an eight-hour day at
Dr. Patel's office, everything went smoothly, and my blood counts were fine. I placed a
small figurine of the Hindu god Ganesh, a gift from my friend Shanny, on the arm rest
next to me during treatment; Ganesh is the god that both places obstacles in one's path
and also removes them. I was grateful for two visits from friends in the morning: from
Jackie, a fellow ""IIIC,"" who brought good cheer and a vanilla milkshake (a sixteen-year
OC and breast cancer survivor and a highly active, vibrant woman, she is inspirational)
and from Kathryn, with whom it's always uplifting to chat. So kind of them to make time
to spend with me.
I am relieved to be done with this part of the treatment. Dr. Mehta even authorized me
to have *one* cocktail (I am jonesing for a stiff Manhattan or a Negroni - anyone care to
join me?). I can't really have more than that as my liver is working overtime these days...
I need to stress strongly, though, both to myself and anyone reading this, that my
journey seems far from over. Dr. Patel even said something like: ""it's going to be a long
haul,"" or something like that. My CA125 marker for ovarian cancer has dropped after
each infusion, but is still 51.2, which Dr. Patel said was ""persistently on the higher side""
and ""concerning."" It could mean that not all the cancer cells were killed off during this
part of the treatment (a particularity of my type of ovarian cancer, as I think I've noted,
is that a portion of my cancer cells are both microscopic and unusually aggressive), or
maybe it could mean something else (I'm not sure what, but at times I've heard this
marker referred to as ""just part of the picture""). My stomach abscess also must resolve
so as not to hinder my further treatment. For example, I have not yet been able to
receive Avastin, a strong drug that might have helped kill cancer cells, because it would
have worsened the stomach abscess problem. Dr. Patel told me that having these types
of abscesses along with cancer is fairly uncommon. It's complicated my treatment.
I'll learn a lot when I go to Hopkins on 11/19. I will have a CT scan of my abdomen, pelvis
and chest, meet with both Drs. Beavis and Mehta (who is overseeing the stomach
abscess part of the equation). Along with Dr. Patel, they will determine a follow-up
treatment plan, if any, and will also discuss timetable for removing the stomach drain. I
am placing a lot of trust in them. The next step will be to repair my fistula, if it hasn't
healed on its own. This will be done either laparoscopically or surgically (which would be
much more invasive). My brother Ethan has very kindly offered to join me in Baltimore
for this visit.
So while I could definitely feel myself tearing up when Dr. Patel told me that my marker
(actually the previous marker of 57) was ""concerning"" (raising the possibility at least that
I won't go into remission after this first treatment), I will try to get myself to a better
place emotionally and psychologically. I am ""stable"" (per Dr. Patel), really pretty strong
in terms of overall conditioning; I walk, drive, go out with friends, have not had any
                       230 / 1.901
fevers, notable nausea, colds etc. If the marker is persistently on the higher side, at least
it's trended downwards each time. And if I could survive a thirteen-hour surgery, I'll be
ready for whatever they throw at me next. [btw, Dr. Patel put my mind to rest about the
discharge coming from my stomach drainage tube; he said it's just a reaction to a
foreign object being placed in my skin and does not believe it is an infection of any sort].
I had a terrific time with ""mes filles,"" Shanny and Isabelle over the weekend. We gabbed
non-stopped, giggled mightily, laughed uproariously over old pictures from our grad
school days, reminisced, cooked a nice dinner together (actually, Isa and Shanny did
most of the cooking), did a little dancing to r&b tunes as we have done many times in
the past, ate some goodies from NY and NJ (rugelach, superior bread and bagels), sat in
the sun in the beautiful arboretum, enjoyed a relaxing coffee on the porch at Cafe
Lemont, drove out pretty Rte 45 to Milheim for brunch at Elk Creek cafes, watching the
Amish buggies roll by. Thanks to Shanny's strong interest in spirituality, we also held a
crystal over our hand to obtain answers to certain pressing questions in our lives (the
crystal moved one way for yes and another for no). While I can't reveal everything about
our experience in divination, I do have a scoop to share, confirmed by each of us asking
the crystal the same question: Trump will *not* be reelected president in 2020! Finally,
Shanny taught us a 'loving kindness meditation,' which is ultimately supposed to
encourage that quality in ourselves. I will practice it with the travel meditation kit she
brought me (Isa brought me gorgeous candlesticks from Vienna with a Klimt design on
them). We three are working out a plan to spend a few nights at a retreat (called Kipralu)
in the Berkshires in December, hopefully with a few other of our other NYU friends. In
any event, it was a wonderful visit, spent reaping the rewards of nearly forty years of
friendship, including sharing all the ups and downs that life has placed in our path.
The massive fatigue has not yet hit me but may well do so tomorrow. Still, I asked my
neighbor if she would drive me to vote at some point as I feel strongly about that. I may
be in my sweats, half asleep, and look like a ragamuffin, but I hope to get there!
The challenge of living with a serious disease that may not be definitively curable while
at the same time living a meaningful life and continuing to define what that means for
myself.
Thanks so much for the many caring texts yesterday and today, and for the comfort food
meals for the next few days. I appreciate them so much. Please keep me in your
thoughts and prayers going forward too, if it's not too much trouble.
Love,
Willa

If I can drag myself out of bed the day after chemo to go exercise my civic responsibility
and right, you can too! My neighbor Janis was kind enough to drive me, with a pit stop
afterwards at Lupita’s Mexican restaurant to pick up some refreshing paletas (melon,
coconut, orange). Slept until noon and am now back in bed, but not (yet?) feeling
atrocious. As of now, seem to feel slightly less exhausted than after the last round. But
will follow what my body dictates.

69,"""I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in/And stops my mind from wandering where it will
go....""
A therapy session was helpful today in starting to raise me out of the funk I'd fallen into
the past few days, maybe the past week (since my final round of chemo last Monday). I
spend a lot of time alone, thinking, letting my mind wander ""where it will go."" I also
spend a lot of time horizontal, either sleeping or resting. While much of this time likely
serves a beneficial purpose - my body needs the rest to gain strength and combat
disease -- some of it seems more avoidant, of the ""pull the quilt up over my head and
check out of reality"" variety. I can usually tell the difference. 
I know I am anxious about my appointments at Hopkins next week. A lot is riding on
them. The CT scan should reveal whether the six rounds of chemo were successful (ie it
may show NED - no evidence of disease - or, conversely, evidence of residual cancer).
Either result will determine a further course of treatment (PARP inhibitors as
maintenance therapy? more chemo? more surgery??). And I presume how 'well' I pass
this milestone will inflect my prognosis. This in turn will have implications for whether
and in what form I can return to work in January. And so much of it is out of my hands,
despite being centered in my body, ie in what is 'closest' to me. This morning, the
""Serenity Prayer"" went through my mind: ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot
change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference."" I am very grateful that my
brother, Ethan, will travel from NY to Baltimore to be with me during my appointments. I will appreciate his
steady and compassionate presence.
My anxiety about the appointments had started to spin wildly and weepily into terror of a
shorter than anticipated lifespan and separation from loved ones. This feeling of grief is
so powerful it's hard even to write about it.
                       241 / 1.901
In any event, what I realized today is that while the quantity of life I have left (or that any
of us has left) is likely among the ""things I cannot change"" (beyond, of course, practicing
good self-care etc.), I can change its quality to some extent. I can do my part to ensure
that my interactions with beloved family, friends etc. are meaningful and impactful. I
may not be able to do that incredible hike my friend Mitchel and I took two years ago
today to a hill town overlooking Nice and the Mediterranean (thank you, Facebook
Memories), but I can treasure its memory, and remind him of that lovely day (and future
such hikes are not outside the realm of possibility!). I hope this all doesn't sound too
corny or Pollyanna-ish, but I've needed to get 'unstuck' and feel that I'm making some
progress towards that goal.
During services at shul, we thank our 'foremothers' -- Rebecca, Rachel, Leah, Sarah -- for
'girding on' faith when times got tough and for being an example of virtuous behavior for
us. A mystical faith also seemed to be an inspiration for Harriet Tubman in leading over
70 slaves to freedom, per the biopic I saw this weekend. While I'm skeptical (at least at
this point) that faith is going to be my prime motivator through this ordeal, I will at least
try to continue to 'gird on' courage, wherever it may come from (the support of family
and friends is a huge inspiration and source of support).

71,"The news is the best I could have hoped for: today's CT scan revealed that I am in
remission (which for Dr. Beavis means that ""nothing obvious appeared on the scan""). So
I am among the 80% of women who go into remission after debulking surgery followed
by chemo. Normally, in a week I can also discontinue the two antibiotics I've been taking
by infusion for several months. This feels like a wonderful 'reprieve' in the context of a
punishing disease, and I will certainly take it! Dr. Beavis and Dr. Westin (another
wonderful doctor in the gynoc practice) stressed to me that I am now entering a new
phase -- the 'survivorship' stage -- during which I can and should begin to focus on
resuming my 'old' life to the extent possible -- beginning with enjoying the upcoming
holidays!
I had not anticipated such welcome news. Because my CA125 level (ovarian cancer
marker) was ""concerning,"" according to Dr. Patel, I surmised it was because I had
residual cancer. Drs. Beavis and Westin explained to me, though, that that number could
reflect *any* inflammation in the abdominal area, including the abscess that is still
draining in my abdomen.
I am now also entering the ""surveillance"" stage. This means that Drs. Beavis and Patel
will be keeping very close watch on me through blood work, exams, CT scans, PET scans
etc.; the first six to twelve months are especially crucial. I will see one or the other of
them every three months. The issue regarding my fistula also must be resolved, but Dr.
Beavis wants to let my body recover completely from the chemo before the fistula is
repaired. So I will return to Hopkins the first week in January to determine whether -- if
the fistula has not closed on its own -- it will be repaired laparoscopically or surgically. If
the latter, the recovery time will be much longer (about six weeks). This in turn will pose
                       246 / 1.901
problems regarding whether I can return to work in January, as I'm hoping to. There are a
number of important, complicated matters such as this that I have to figure out now... 
I also have to decide whether to take chemo drugs called PARP inhibitors as a
maintenance therapy. According to the newest studies, these inhibitors can delay
recurrences by several months, but they have no curative function. On the other hand,
they have side effects (fatigue, nausea, lowered blood counts). It's a quality v. quantity
of life decision. Another tough one...
Carpe diem seems even more urgent given that half the women in my position (ie
ovarian cancer patients who have had debulking surgery plus chemo) have a recurrence
within five years. A sobering statistic. Others, of course -- and I have met some of them --
have recurrences between five and ten years out. Cancer-free for ten years is considered
cured. 
Still plenty of uncertainty, then, but for now there is reason for modest or even less
modest celebration (perhaps I'll indulge in that one cocktail I'm allowed to have...).
My brother has been my stalwart companion/'ride or die' the past two days and I'm ever
so grateful to him for being by my side during my appointments. The upside is that
we've been able to catch up and simply hang out together (we had a wonderful Italian
meal at La Scala last night, and were glued to the impeachment hearings this morning).

72,"Each phase of this disease has its challenges. Transitioning from being a patient
('victim??') to a survivor (although I realize the two categories can overlap) is fraught.
Why? First, while I'm certainly very relieved that Tuesday's CT scan showed nothing
worrisome in terms of cancer regrowth, I also know that a recurrence is likely; it seems
to me that the word ""remission"" would need to be qualified in some way. It feels like a bit
of a swindle. Next, in all honesty I have probably felt 'wedded to my disease' in some
way; it provided me with an identity (I suppose 'survivor' does as well), and also ensured
an outpouring of care and love from my 'village.' Now that I'm 'better,' will there be an
expectation on the part of others (and perhaps myself) that things return to 'normal' (or
to the new normal, or the newer normal)? Finally, and related to the previous point,
simply returning to my life after going through such an arduous, even hellish experience
since April cannot be accomplished seamlessly, it seems to me. Perhaps every day
further from chemo the easier the transition will become.
Thank you to everyone, though, for your warm outpouring of relief and enthusiasm on
my good news! If all goes as planned and I continue to feel well, I have a bit of a reprieve
until January, when I will need to have my fistula repaired at JH, hopefully in the least
invasive way possible...
A wise and compassionate woman who is a fellow survivor was able to articulate exactly
what I'm feeling, and offered some sage advice (I hope she won't mind my quoting her
text here, but I'm not including her name for confidentiality purposes): ""It's tough on us
emotionally when treatment ends and we are left on our own [...] One day at a time. Live
your precious life well! It's a gift. Enjoy it. Celebrate it. And lastly, lean on other survivors
who KNOW the feeling [...] we are in treatment forever. Our lives have changed. The
blinders are off. So your job now...live love laugh. That overused statement is so true.""
Drs. Beavis and Westin also stressed to me that my mission now, from their perspective,
                       252 / 1.901
is to live my life to the fullest. I suppose I'm the type of person who always tries to
practice this, but perhaps there's more urgency or purposefulness about that now. I am
greatly looking forward, for starters, to Ben coming home on Tuesday for the holiday! We
will be going to Michael (Ben's dad) and Sue's, and I'm sure we'll have a lovely holiday. I
spent part of the afternoon cooking a *vat* of cranberry chutney (jalapeno cornbread
and sweet potato casserole to follow). 
It occurred to me that now that the 'initial treatment' chapter of my journey is over, I
should end my journal, or at least go on hiatus. But I suppose that I still have things I
want to write, and as long as I do I'll keep going. Thank you for taking the time to read
my posts.
P.S. Dr. Beavis wrote me to say that she thinks I am doing ""remarkably well given
everything [I've] been through"" -- hopeful words...",3,joy,0.55158025,0.017923972,0.019657582,0.065262154,0.55158025,0.2969628,0.043603186,0.0050100563

Thankful for:
*My current 'honeymoon period' in terms of  my health now that I'm in remission -- for as
long as it lasts.
*My medical team at both Geisinger in State College (Dr. Nilesh Patel, my medical
oncologist) and at Hopkins (Dr. Seema Mehta, infectious diseases specialist, and
especially Dr. Anna Beavis, my gynecological/surgical oncologist)
*The enduring support and love of my family. A beautiful autumn flower arrangement
sent by my dear mother for the holiday.
*The overwhelming support of a large network of friends, colleagues, neighbors and Brit
Shalom congregants near and far who have formed a durable ""security blanket"" and who
have made me feel like I'm not alone during my health challenge. Grateful for the many
many acts of kindness and caring (meals, calls, rides, emails, texts, errands, visits, gifts,
cards and more) since May.
*The Family and Medical Leave Act, which has allowed me to take a paid medical leave
from my job this semester;
*Time to simply hang out this weekend with my beloved son, Ben. Running errands,
grabbing lunch, cooking, watching t.v. together all seem extra special this year! Grateful
that Ben is healthy and doing very well.
*A friendly and highly functional relationship with my ex-husband, Michael, and his wife,
Sue, which enabled us to spend a lovely holiday together, with delicious food (I made the
corn bread, sweet potato casserole and cranberry chutney, while Michael and Sue made
the turkey, stuffing, gravy and glazed brussel sprouts. Ben brought to die for apple and
pecan pies from Buttercream Bakery in D.C.). We enjoyed the company of a mutual
friend, Pearl, as well as a visit by two of Ben's friends since grade school, who stopped by
for pie. Heart-warming to see these pals together after so many years.
*A comfortable home, freedom from want...
*My own patience and fortitude.
 
I am feeling pretty well overall, but am getting nervous about a slightly scratchy throat
                       257 / 1.901
that I'll have my PCP look at this week if it gets worse. As I'm no longer receiving
chemotherapy, nor am I taking the two antibiotics I was prescribed for several months, I
suddenly feel rather unprotected, and this in turn is making me hyper-focused on my
body. Perhaps it's unavoidable.
 
I hope that you have many reasons to feel thankful, too, and that you spent an enjoyable
holiday..

74,"I have been thinking about this distinction ever since Drs. Beavis and Westin exhorted
me to grab life by the horns and ride it hard during this 'honeymoon' period of remission.
I associate 'survival' with specific images from the past six months -- waking up in the
ICU after a thirteen hour surgery with a breathing tube down my throat, barely able to
press the pump with pain meds that were providing some relief from the excruciating
pain in my abdomen; having a needle inserted into my back (and I think my lung?) to
drain two quarts of fluid; inability to keep any food or liquid down for days. 'Survivorship,'
I'm learning, is something else; it is forward looking, hopeful. It resides in the 'sweet
spot' between acceptance (or non-denial) of a probable recurrence -- if I remain fixated
on the probability of a recurrence, am I somehow complicit in the idea that 'remission'
may be to some extent a swindle? -- and the courage to move forward or simply to
*move* in some direction. It is the courage, in the works of a song I like by Debbie
Friedman (Mi Shebeirach/Prayer for Healing), to ""make one's life a blessing.""
For the first time since late April, I have begun to make some forward looking plans. In
thinking about how I want to use my time to *live* I actually focused on what I would
miss most when I *die.* This strategy, if one can call it hat, was suggested in an NPR
interview I read with BJ Miller, a highly inspirational, brilliant palliative care doctor, whose
new book, A Beginner's Guide to the End, I have put on my reading list (turns out this
'how to die well' book is all about *life,* which echoes my strong feeling that until we are
dead we are *living* and not 'dying,' and our lives can and do have meaning until the
end). This strategy of focusing on death to chart a path in life simplified things for me: I
would most miss Ben, the rest of my family, my friends, and meaningful work (those
were the first things that came to me, although I might have added travel; there may
well be others!).
Consequently, today I booked a trip to D.C. between Xmas and New Year's (treating
myself to a favorite hotel there...), bought my Megabus ticket to New York, where I will
spend some time after the 13th, and further firmed up plans for a yoga/wellness retreat
in the Berkshires next week with four dear friends from grad school. Finally, remaining
details are pending, but I'm now expecting to return to work in January in conditions that
will work well for me right now. I'm feeling energized by all these developments
(although I hope I haven't overdone it...). Now I just need to keep fingers firmly crossed
that my health holds  -- nothing is guaranteed and those cancer cells may well be
lurking, although I benefited from a very aggressive debulking surgery in May -- and that
I continue to regain my strength. I will have the procedure to repair the fistula in my
abdomen at the beginning of January. Fingers crossed again that the necessary
procedure will be minimally invasive. The degree of invasiveness will be determined, also
in January, by a 'fistulagram' revealing the exact size and nature of the fistula.
In my 'thankfulness' list from my last post, I need to add that I am enormously grateful to
                       265 / 1.901
my college classmate Steven Sherman, an endocrinologist at MD Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston. When I contacted Steve via Facebook for help/information in an utter
panic after receiving my diagnosis last April, he immediately got on the phone to several
oncologist colleagues, telling me ""we'll get you situated."" Very shortly after that, he
hooked me up with the gyn oncs at Hopkins (where Steve completed part of his medical
studies and where one of his colleagues specializes in ovarian tumors). I received a call
from Dr. Anna Beavis a day or two after that. We spent an hour speaking by phone. As
luck would have it, she happened to have an opening for a lengthy surgery for the
following week. Fortuitously, then, I very quickly found my way into expert hands, and I
really owe this to Steve. :)",4,neutral,0.48464116,0.008323039,0.050830793,0.11338451,0.017700516,0.48464116,0.31046042,0.014659627

My dear friend Shanny, whom  I can't wait to see on Wednesday when we trek north
from NYC to Kripalu Yoga and Wellness Center in Lenox, MA, recently sent me a care
package composed of several thoughtful gifts, including crystals, some ""Inner Strength""
loose tea, and ""contemplation cards"" consisting of words to meditate on, discuss, absorb.
The first word I chose at random was ""detoxify."" I eagerly await several days of
""detoxifying"" with four wonderful grad school friends (aka ""les filles"") at Kripalu, where
I've booked both a massage and a facial and which boasts energizing yoga classes, a
relaxing sauna, idyllic surroundings in the Berkshires and food that's - apparently -  both
healthful and delicious. And lots of laughs and sharing guaranteed with this crew.
I should have borne detoxifying in mind on Thursday, when some poor eating choices
(nuts, dried fruits, greasy Thai take out) may have contributed to my going to bed with
excruciating stomach pain, which eventually became so bad that I called an EMS
ambulance at 2 a.m. to take me to the ER. I stayed at the hospital in State College the
better part of the day, and was well attended to. Saw four doctors both in the ER and
then on the floor once I was admitted, who told me the CT scan revealed a 'lazy bowel'
or perhaps the beginning of a bowel obstruction (this no longer appears to be the case). I
also needed an infusion of magnesium. Over the course of the day I began to feel better
and was released c. 5 p.m. I had a few teary moments of 'aloneness' in the hospital, but
in the end felt I had made the right decision, given all my abdominal issues resulting
from the big surgery last May, to err on the side of caution and get the pain checked
out. 
 
In the interest of detoxifying, I changed my order at the last minute at a soul-warming
lunch today with the ""III Cs"" (local OC survivors) plus our mutual friend Aileen Galley (see
photo), who in the context of her former job was responsible for bringing these OC
survivors together. Instead of the spicy and carb-heavy Thai chicken salad, I opted for
the protein-rich scallop salad. Eliminating 'toxins' of all sorts, in all realms of my life,
seems essential to strong survivorship.
A few updates: the procedure to repair my fistula is scheduled for Jan. 3rd. I'll meet Dr.
Holly, the interventional radiologist who will perform the procedure, on the 2nd. I am
rooting for the less invasive 'patching' procedure. Getting my head around another open
surgery would be hard for me to deal with right now....
...and would delay my return to work, now scheduled for the beginning of next semester.
I'll be returning in optimal conditions given the major health challenges of the past six
months: I won't be department head, nor will I be teaching. My interim department head,
dean, and HR staff have been very compassionate in working out this arrangement with
me. I'll perform service (committees, specific tasks for the department etc.), work with
the graduate students whose dissertations I'm directing or am involved with, and
                       270 / 1.901
hopefully push forward with my research. If my health holds, I'll likely return to the
headship in the fall. I am looking forward to feeling useful and returning to the work that
I enjoy very much and to the collegial atmosphere on campus. I just pray that my
stamina and health hold and that my return to work will be unproblematic.
In other news: let the fun continue in DC, where we've booked both dinner at a buzz-
generating restaurant (The Queen's English, featuring Hong Kong cuisine) and tickets for
a concert by the Roots (Questlove!) at the Kennedy Center. Can't wait to see Ben (whom
I'll also see in NY next weekend) and Sammi, and perhaps a few friends if the scheduling
works out.
So I'm on the road again, as I love to be, Megabussing it to the city tomorrow. This will be
my first non-medical travel since April! Happy trails, all.",3,joy,0.7915091,0.0025738222,0.0023931314,0.006692835,0.7915091,0.16522864,0.013398437,0.01820403

When I awoke in the ICU following my thirteen-hour debulking surgery in May, the only
way I realized for sure that I was alive was by hearing the sound of my breathing. Slowly,
other parts of my body came into focus: I could wiggle my fingers and toes, see the
outline of a clock on the wall in front of me.
In retrospect, ""breathing"" seemed a central focus of my restorative recent stay at Kripalu
Center for Yoga and Health in Stockbridge, MA, in part a celebration of my long
friendship (37 years!) with Isabelle, Vinni and Shanny, whom I met at age 23 in grad
school at NYU (in various combinations, we've been roommates over the years too, in
both New York and Paris). Many of the wonderful classes (eg Gentle Yoga and the
particularly excellent, body- and soul-freeing Yoga Dance) and workshops (Seven Steps
to Aging Well) I attended focused on breathing techniques, on calming the body, de-
stressing, letting go to the point where if I closed my eyes and let myself drift I could
envision a calmer version of myself, wearing my purple chemo cap and wrapped in a soft
gray blanket, floating above my physical being.
Life-sustaining breath also enabled my body to impress me with its stamina, given all it's
been through since May. With my friends I walked at least a mile if not more over snow
covered trails through pine groves to a pretty lake; granted, this is much less than I am
normally capable of walking but nowadays because of lingering discomfort in my
diaphragm/abdominal area I tend to get winded after a while. I also took two vigorous
yoga classes the same day -- balanced (following the mantra of ""we deserve it!"") by a
relaxing aromatherapy massage, Dr. Hauschka facial, and stimulating dip in the
whirlpool.
I embraced the focus on well-being, including the emphasis on 'conscious eating.' The
meals, despite being prepared for what seemed like a full house of 600 or more
guests,** were unusually delicious and healthful: the breakfast buffet one day featured
pumpkin brioche French toast with local maple syrup; yummy cold sesame noodles and a
portabella mushroom 'lasagna' were served lunch, and shrimp in cilantro pesto for dinner
(I also loved the creamy parsley feta salad dressing, one of about six homemade
dressings available). **quite a cool 'scene,' about 80% women, lots of toned bodies and
some not so toned, and a great variety of interesting yoga attire; with my purple chemo
skullcap, dangly silver earrings and lovely Indian shawl that Vinni gifted me I did not feel
out of place!
My friend Shanny, both highly adept at yoga and knowledgeable about various forms of
non-Western spirituality, encouraged us other 'filles' (French for 'gals,' as we've called
each other for years...) to set an intention for the day. ""Listen to your body"" became my
intention one day (especially pertinent after my recent trip to the ER), ""be gentle with
yourself"" was the guiding principle for the following day (following a night of less sleep
                       274 / 1.901
than I usually need).
Friendship is an essential nutrient in my emotional and spiritual diet. The opportunity to
reconnect with three of my closest friends was, consequently, soul-warming. Like the
twenty-somethings we once were, we still giggle and often laugh raucously when
together (enhanced by some *legal* 'contraband' smuggled into the center for the
occasion...), speak in franglais, take ridiculously goofy selfies, and stay up late at our
impromptu slumber parties; we also had fun asking a crystal pendulum all sorts of
questions both silly and serious. Yet now our gossip sessions are intermixed with other
concerns: recent illness and death of parents, disease (two of us are cancer survivors),
worries about our kids, career-related issues, the prospect of retirement. In short, the All
of It. Shanny and I spent an additional seven hours or so gabbing in the car from
Brooklyn to the Berkshires and back. Our convo roamed from relationships of all sorts
(familial, romantic, marital, with our exes and friends etc.) to spirituality to climate
change to the meaningful concept of wabi-sabi, a Japanese esthetic that stresses the
beauty that comes with imperfection, flaws and age (exemplified by rust or cracks in
porcelain). Hopefully my sternum to pubis scar (my 'battle scar') also manifests this
concept -- the 'crack' or brokenness that, in Leonard Cohen's lyric from ""Anthem,"" lets
the light in (""There is a crack, a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in"").
In short, it was a wonderful, relaxing, fun and meaningful getaway, one that we hope to
make into an annual tradition.
*** 
I am grateful to be in the city for the week, reveling in a welcome change of scene,
spending time with family and friends (Ben was up from DC yesterday and we enjoyed a
family dinner at my mother's apartment with my brother, sister-in-law and nephew). A
special treat today was meeting Diane, another ""IIIC"" OC survivor about a year out from
chemo (and a member of my extended family). It was encouraging for me to both share
information and experiences (eg about post-surgery complications) and meet another OC
survivor who appears to be thriving (Diane was back to work very shortly after
completing chemo). The support and friendship of other OC survivors has come to be
quite important for my own continued forward-looking survivorship. I share a depth of
understanding with these women that is unique to our experience.
***
On another note: if anyone is available to drive me to Hopkins on the morning of Jan. 2nd
(*actually, it will most likely need to be Jan. 1st) and/or pick me up most likely the
morning of Jan. 4th (but that is still tbd), it would, of course, help me out immensely.

All's well.

If friends are an essential nutrient in my diet -- and in my *recovery* diet -- than my hometown is as well.
Spending the week in the city energized me, as it often does, and actually made me feel better. Can a city, or
any special place, really do that? Granted, I made sure not to overdo the running around and, except for one
foray to the UWS (Upper West Side), retained downtown as my center of gravity. My mother also kindly
made sure I was especially comfortable in her apartment, even installing me in her bedroom for the week
while she slept on the sofa bed in the second bedroom. So for the most part I continued to get the extra
sleep I still need. :) And the security blanket of family feels especially welcome and safe these days. We (my
brother, sis-in-law Ronit, niece Eve and nephew Isaac, my mother and her partner Arnold, and Ben who was
                       277 / 1.901
up from DC for the weekend) enjoyed a family dinner/pizza party one evening at my mother's apartment. A
few days later, my mother, niece and I braved the deep freeze of the tip of Manhattan island (Bowling Green)
to shop at an Alsatian-style holiday market, before seeking out some hot soup.
Friends + family +/in New York = a nutrient with a special boost. I am just sorry that I couldn't see more
friends during this stay. I had a perfectly zen moment yesterday morning (thank you, Lexapro?) sitting in the
midst of incredible bustle at Breads Bakery on 16th street, where my brother Ethan and I treated my mother
to a birthday breakfast (see pics). Somehow, the long line to get coffee, tables jammed together and turning
over constantly, and employees hurriedly pushing carts of fragrant, warm baked goods all blended into what
became a pleasant 'whoosh,' creating a cocoon of sound that was, simultaneously, comforting, slightly
'exotic' because so far removed from the absolute stillness I am used to at night in State College, and yet
familiar to me from my growing up years in the city and my grad school years at NYU. Will I wind up back in
NYC one day? There's certainly a good chance of it, but who knows? 
Given that I'm generally feeling well right now and am really starting to regain energy (please may it
continue...), I am overjoyed to be back to one of my favorite activities -- breaking bread (hopefully, notably
good bread...) and diving into conversation w/a friend or relative in an interesting/cool/relaxing setting. Over
delicious udon noodles in curry broth (perfect for a downright frigid day in the city), my college friend Josh
brought wisdom from his long practice of martial arts and wrote me this email after lunch, encouraging me to
channel what I might call my 'innner samurai:' ""You may discover an inner resilience as you've never noticed
before--the stalk of bamboo rather than a brittle iron rod--and observe parts you never knew were working inside you. If it
is toughness there, you may need even more toughness. If it is gentleness there, then you may find even greater
gentleness."" And over a brunch that turned into a lunch at the wonderful Marlton Hotel (in a renovated 1900 building in the
Village), another dear college friend, Bryan, encouraged me to rethink my diet with the goal of even greater healthfulness
(smoothies, apparently, might be key); I felt guilty eating even a few of the yummy frites accompanying the mini-turkey
meatball and mozzarella panini we shared, but do intend to be even more mindful than currently about my diet. I am so
grateful for the sage advice of my friends. I hope I can pay it back and/or forward...
Heading back to State College tomorrow for the week; I'll see Dr. Patel on Tuesday to discuss maintenance
therapy, have my port flushed, and have blood taken for my upcoming procedure at Hopkins. Next Friday I'll
fly to to DC to visit Ben. In a change of plans, instead of returning to SC for basically one day, I will likely stay
in DC over New Year's (at Ben's, while he is in NY) and then head to Baltimore on New Year's Day to get
ready for my appointments and (hopefully) procedure on the 2nd/3rd (my mother is kindly meeting me there).
If any State College peeps are driving back from Baltimore/DC on the 3rd or 4th and could give me a ride it
would, as ever, be greatly appreciated!

Written by the glow of the menorah...
 
Light is life, and I especially welcome its presence, illuminating the dark corners, not just
during the most lightless days of the year (I love the convergence of the solstice and
Chanukah) but at the end of a year that was often pitch dark for me. Chanukah also
commemorates the victory of the few over the many, the triumph of spirit over military
might -- ""not by might, not by power, but by spirit alone."" Yes, spirit, I've learned, can be
remarkably strong and resilient. As for the 'miracle' part, in the case of the small vial of
oil that lasted for eight days -- ""Do you believe in miracles?"" sings Matisyahu -- I'm not
necessarily convinced. And warfare leaves me cold. And yet, there is beauty and
meaning in this 'festival of lights.'
Can light drive out the darkness that has cast our nation into such horrific chaos for the
past two years? I pray so. ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.
Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that,"" wrote Martin Luther King, wisely. As
for my own 'dark corners,' I currently need more clarity about whether or not to take a
maintenance chemo drug called a PARP inhibitor that data suggests can delay a
recurrence but that can have some undesirable side effects (exhaustion, vomiting,
nausea) and that seems to work better in patients who are BRCA positive, (which is not
my case; instead of having a hereditary component, my cancer is the result of a random
genetic mutation). This morning, my medical oncologist, Dr. Patel, did not express a
strong opinion on this (but said, variously, ""let's wait until after your fistula is repaired""
or ""please consult Dr. Beavis to see whether she has data on success rates for patients
such as you, who are BRCA negative and had/have a lot of cancer"" -- that last part of
his comments really stuck in my throat...). Dr. Beavis, in turn, has initially left the choice
about whether or not to take the PARP inhibitors -- which have no curative effect -- up to
me, so I really hope I'll be able to further consult her on this at Hopkins when I am there
Jan. 2-3. Apparently, at Sloan Kettering they do not even prescribe PARP inhibitors to
women who are BRCA negative and who have responded well to first-line chemo.
So....much...uncertainty, which is frustrating and anxiety-provoking.  I will get further
input and try to make the best informed decision I can. My vitals were all good this
morning so there is that, and I continue to feel stronger, with little need for rest during
the day.
I was also thrown into 'obscurity' briefly today when no pharmacy in town appeared to
have the saline-filled syringes that I need to flush my stomach drain. After about seven
phone calls, though, I found a pharmacy that carries them, got my prescription
transferred from the pharmacy I usually use, and will pick them up tomorrow.
It was lovely to have coffee today with a favorite undergraduate student, and to revel in
the ""normalcy"" of that welcome, relaxing ""down time"" feeling I associate with winter

break in our much quieter than usual college town. She gifted me a cool candle
embedded with pieces of volanic lava from her trip to Iceland over Thanksgiving break. I
feel incredibly touched to also receive, today, a homemade holiday cranberry bread,
which one of my neighbors hand delivered, and a gift bag containing an interesting-
looking novel and a divine-smelling product from Occitane awaiting me on my doorstep,
from a very kind friend. I am trying to finish up my card writing before I leave for DC on
Friday, although I find it hard to express my gratitude for all the love, care and concern,
support and encouragement and generosity that's been showered on me this year.
Dozens of points of light in the darkness, for sure.
We enjoyed a sweet first-night celebration of Chanukah at synagogue last night -- candle
lighting followed by a soup and latkes dinner. So nice to share this w/my community. I
met an intriguing-seeming man at the event -- a local chiropractor (and, apparently,
actor) who divides his time between State College and NYC (where he also has a 'healing
arts' practice) and who grew up in SC (played football for PSU). We have a coffee date for
tomorrow. Will anything come of it? Now *that* would be a Chanukah miracle. But living
one day at a time (still hard for a type-A person like myself) has taught me to be quite

This past Friday morning bright and early (the sun was just starting to rise), as I sat at
my dining table eating a yogurt before getting ready to leave for DC (my neighbors
kindly drove me to the airport), I decided to select a 'contemplation card' from the deck
Shanny had given me, hoping it might provide some food for reflection during my
upcoming trip. I selected, at random, ""Journey."" I placed the card in the window that
accompanies the box holding the deck, making a mental note to contemplate later.
As if on cue (thank you, subconscious) that night, in DC, I had an exhausting (and
exhaustive) dream about a journey; unfortunately, I didn't write it down immediately so I
am forgetting some of the details. I was with a group but also, somehow, separate from
them. The journey consisted of portions by sea and by land (with sub-portions of this
latter phase with transportation and on foot). Each portion was marked by notable
events or occurrences. For example, during one portion I noticed that at least two people
in the group had formed a couple. At long last we were at the very northern (I believe)
edge of Harvard's campus with several miles to walk to our destination (which was
unclear). Melded into this dream was another dream about resuming therapy (with my
previous therapist, not my current one) after this long journey. I was completely foggy on
my appointment time/date, because I had been away for so long. I took a chance and
showed up at what I believed to be the correct time/place. It's possible that a high school
friend of mine also showed up at the same time, but I don't remember more.
As if this voyage wasn't enough, I realized that the next day would be the last day of the
semester (at Penn State, I believe) and I had to prepare something for the session. I
decided it would be 'easy' to prepare a trivia quiz or game (and perhaps also a
'hangman' game?) for the students, until I realized that generating questions for the quiz
would be very time-consuming. I also realized with dismay that in a course (similar to
one I've taught many times in reality) that was supposed to end with World War I, we
had only covered only up to 1850.
My not very enlightened interpretation of all this is that I've indeed been on the psychic,
emotional and physical journey of a lifetime since my diagnosis in April, a journey
constituted of several phases. I've been well surrounded by a group of companions but
have also been going it alone. This journey has at times drawn my thoughts backwards
in time (in the dream: Harvard, my previous therapist). Now that I'm returning to work in
January, I feel anxious -- this ""I'm unprepared for class"" dream is one I've had many
times; interestingly, though, while I usually dream about the first day of class in this case
it was the last day. Indeed, I missed the entire last semester as I was on medical leave,
'reemerging' at campus events only at the very end of the semester when I started
feeling better. I am not certain what else to make about the end/beginning connection.
There's likely more stuff to tease out in the dream; perhaps it will come to me on further
                       289 / 1.901
cogitation.
Of course, recently I've started to travel again, for the first time since my diagnosis. New
York and now Washington, where I'm spending a few days with my dear son. I am
generally feeling well, despite some lingering and nearly chronic discomfort/tenderness
on my right side (near my drain insertion site). Dr. Patel said it's likely some
inflammation but nothing to worry about. I am praying that this will not interfere with my
upcoming procedure at Hopkins... But as Ben observed, my appetite is back with a
vengeance. Ben, Sammi (Ben's delightful girlfriend) and I enjoyed some great meals at
Queen's English (a trendy place in Columbia Heights featuring Hong Kong cuisine), Bistro
Lepic (a great neighborhood bistro in upper Georgetown that I discovered when I was
staying at Dumbarton Oaks about a year ago; they serve excellently prepared classics
like coquilles Saint-Jacques and sweetbreads, with profiteroles for dessert). I've regained
about ten pounds of the 25 I lost following surgery but am still feeling relatively trim. We
also walked about four miles on Saturday through Rock Creek Park to Hillwood Museum
and Gardens, where we took a docent tour of Marjorie Merriweather Post's estate and
strolled the gardens (including a Japanese rock garden after my own heart...). Last night,
after seeing the crazily intense film ""Uncut Gems"" to  escape a downpour outside
(followed by a shopping trip to Zara and walk around the newish Wharf District), we went
to the Roots' concert at the Kennedy Center; unfortunately, the lyrics of this talented hip-
hop group were unintelligible but I've been reading them online today. If ""living well is
the best revenge"" - against the Beast, in this case?... -- then I am throwing myself into it
pretty hard core, soaking it all up as I love to do. Please may it last.... it sure beats a
hospital bed... Shortly, I'll pack up my stuff here in my hotel (the wonderful Mandarin
Oriental, where I sit now in my room on the top floor with a lovely view of the Tidal Basin
and the Potomac) and Uber to Ben's, where I plan to finish out the year in a mellow
mode. Ben and I will cook something at home tonight before he leaves to spend NYE in
New York, and I hope to have lunch with my friend Jeff tomorrow.
So Ben will travel from DC to New York, I will go from DC to Baltimore (and then return to
State College on Saturday, hopefully), my mother will travel from NY to Baltimore to
meet me at Hopkins, and my brother is making a quick round trip from NY to Baltimore
and back, to spend time, per tradition at the end of the year, with his college
roommates. Journeys...",6,surprise,0.42652625,0.005528821,0.0043264744,0.12954341,0.016397921,0.38491508,0.032762025,0.42652625

Happily ensconced in Ben's bedroom in the row house where he lives on M Street,
overlooking the small housing project and the huge white church that takes up almost a
city block (the United House of Prayer for All People of the Church of the Rock of the
Apostolic Faith). Ben and Sammi are in NYC for NYE, but I am here, cozily on this mild
day, winding down the year (and decade). My friend/ex-bf Jeff met me for a while to
select some goodies at Buttercream Bakery, before sitting outside in the sun at La
Colombe cafe in Blagden Alley, catching up and trading tales as we like to do (see pic).
Headed to Baltimore at some point tomorrow. The PET-CT scan on Thursday, the results
of which I will discuss that day with the interventional radiologist (Dr. Holly), will
determine whether the procedure to repair my fistula laparoscopically can go forward
the next day. If the scan reveals significant fluid collection, for example (that niggling
stomach abscess...), the procedure may well be off, to be replaced by an open surgery at
another date. There are no guarantees. I hope for the best outcome, but need to be
prepared for a different one. I am not certain if the PET will also screen for any new or
residual cancer, but I presume it will. I'll also meet with my gyn onc, Dr. Beavis, on
Thursday afternoon.
In no way has cancer been a 'blessing,' in no way am I 'grateful' for having this disease.
In no way do I feel that ""God does not give you more than you can handle"" and/or
""everything happens for a reason."" I understand that this counters the belief of several
religious traditions that find value in suffering. In no way was spending the night before
my 'mother of all surgeries' retching into a garbage can in my hotel room while my
family looked on helplessly a redeeming experience, nor was the crushing post-chemo
fatigue that had me waking up from seventeen-hour slumbers in a stunned stupor, nor
was feeling so overwhelmed I could scarcely make myself a cup of tea, nor was the fact
of missing at least three friends' weddings and a long-planned trip to France with Ben,
nor was having my entire life come crashing down around me, leaving me to grapple
with the possibility of a shorter than hoped-for lifespan.
And yet...
I will simply echo the measured words of my rabbi, David Ostrich, during a visit he paid
me shortly after I returned home from my three-week post-surgery stay at Hopkins: ""You
may find that this experience offers some opportunity for learning:""
*I am stronger than I thought, both physically and mentally. It surprised me to learn that
some cancer patients, even at early stages of their treatment, feel they simply can't
continue with it. Except for a few rare instants when feeling particularly debilitated and
overwhelmed, this has never been my attitude. I'm still feeling well enough, and tough
enough now, to say ""bring it on."" I will keep fighting if need be (and it may very well be,
                       294 / 1.901
given the likelihood of a recurrence...)
*Goodness exists, and it is powerful. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, and while fully
conscious of the fact that evil, ugliness, and mean-spiritedness also exist in spades
(examples too numerous to mention here, and in our faces every day), let me quote
Anne Frank: ""It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and
impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people
are truly good at heart."" One friend brought me a hamsa (protective hand symbol) that
her mother had blessed at the Kotel in Jerusalem; another came by my house to check
on me when Ben and Michael were worried because they couldn't contact me (I was
deep into one of the aforementioned post-chemo big sleeps); another prepared a picnic
and drove me to sit beside a calming creek on a gorgeous summer day; another drove
me, twice, from State College to Baltimore; three others came to spend weekends with
me, to help out with whatever was needed; others ran errands, made chicken noodle
soup, borscht, quiche, rice pudding (the prodigious Meal Train kept me fed for months...),
texted, called, emailed, sent cards, gorgeous floral arrangements, and other thoughtful
gifts (one friend, envisioning me in a hospital gown, sent a colorful, elegant scarf),
prayed, visited, drove me to doctors' appointments, slept over when I was feeling shaky,
sat with me during chemo, brought me milkshakes when that was virtually all I could
stomach, invited me on outings as I continued to improve, took care of everything I left
hanging at work when I had to schedule surgery on short notice, added encouraging and
perceptive comments to this page. My family members have continued to provide rock
solid love and support, accompanying me to Baltimore, providing strong arms to lean on
when my post-surgery 'walks' extended to the house next door, and keeping up a
courageous front despite their fear. ETC. Goodness is restorative (and really beautiful
and pure!). It manifests itself in countless ways. It continues to be an essential element
in my recovery. I do feel privileged to have witnessed so many instances of grace.
Perhaps, in some ways, I have learned to be a 'better' (ie kinder, more empathic) version
of myself, too. I would be glad for that.
*As I wrote earlier about my upcoming procedure, there are no guarantees. But I think I
really understand this now. It's become easier to say ""I love you"" -- and mean it -- to
friends and family. And I hold those hugs for longer, and squeeze tighter. No filter. No
b.s. No day but today.
*I am intoxicated by life, and unready to leave it.
That's what I've learned so far.
Wishing everyone a healthy, happy, successful, fun, peaceful, loving and blessed new
year.
Love, Willa

81,"It's 5:45 p.m. and I've just returned from a long day at Hopkins. There's been a lot to
absorb in one day; there is some news to feel good about yet, as Dr. Beavis confirmed
and as I've said all along, some uncertainty as well.
It looks like I *will* have the laparoscopic (ie 'easier') procedure tomorrow morning, as
hoped for. I met with Dr. Holly, the very confident and competent interventional
radiologist -- and the go-to guy for this relatively new procedure -- who reviewed the PET-
CT scan I had this morning (which took two hours and involved drinking two cups of a
yucky barium drink). My stomach abscess has decreased in size to the point of pretty
much resolving itself; this means that tomorrow a)I can have my stomach drain and
drainage bag, which I've tended to for months, removed (yay!) and b)the abscess does
not pose a risk for the procedure. The procedure will involve a wire, a catheter and a
laser, the result being a 'scarring' (maybe like cauterizing?) of the tissue around the
fistula (hole), closing it. I will be lightly sedated. There is a chance that the fistula will
have closed on its own already (the doctor won't know until he 'goes in'): best case
scenario. Otherwise, he will close it. The procedure, he told me, is successful in 2/3 of
                       297 / 1.901
cases. If it winds up not succeeding -- which will be revealed by a follow up CT scan,
likely in State College in a few weeks -- they can make a second attempt at the
procedure. I am not sure what would happen if that second attempt fails. Dr. Beavis said
to me later that the option of open surgery is ""still on the table.""
With Dr. Beavis, later this afternoon, we reviewed the results of the PET scan. The
*preliminary* radiologist's report indicates that there is an area near where my small and
large intestine meet that *may* be a metastatis (or it may simply be an inflammation, as
Dr. Patel had thought). There is another fluid pocket in the lung that *may* be
suspicious. The CT scan in a few weeks may/should bring further clarity on this. Being
reminded by Dr. Beavis that my cancer was ""extra-extensive"" was not pleasant to hear.
But she also reminded me that there are many treatment options for the recurrence that
in most cases of ovarian cancer is likely. My vital signs are good (low blood pressure, as
always!) and her internal exam of me revealed nothing suspicious (a 'thickened' area in
my vagina that she was concerned about has healed, and there is no evidence of cancer
in the area where my ovaries etc. used to be -- this is good news. Also no evidence of
cancer in my liver, which she had been concerned about too: more good news. Finally, I
can stop taking one of my medications, another bit of good news.
Dr. Beavis and I also discussed whether or not I should take the PARP inhibitors as a
maintenance drug. She shared a very recent (Dec. 2019) _New England Journal of
Medicine_ study that showed that for patients 'like me' (ie BRCA negative) the average
gain in months before a recurrence was less than four months (for patients who are
BRCA positive the gain is much more significant). Is it worth it for me to take these drugs
and risk the side effects (fatigue - although it can be managed, high blood pressure,
altered blood counts, and in a small number of cases, leukemia) to gain a few months
before a recurrence?  On the other hand, if I have a recurrence soon will I regret not
having chosen the more aggressive path? Tough decision, one that I will not make until
after the fistula issue is completely resolved.
So I expect to return to State College on Saturday sans stomach drain and hopefully sans
fistula but with some unresolved questions. Perhaps I'll even know more tomorrow. I
continue to feel like I am in expert hands medically.
Thank you, everyone, for your care and concern. My mother has, as usual, been stalwart
and has maintained a positive attitude all along. We are going out shortly to a Lebanese
restaurant recommended by Dr. Beavis (who cleared me to drink in moderation!). I do
look forward to a nice glass of wine after a tiring day and before tomorrow's procedure. I
didn't sleep well last night because I was anxious, so I'm hoping tonight I'll fare better.",4,neutral,0.75245994,0.005583726,0.008755112,0.102538444,0.047939334,0.75245994,0.05147185,0.03125162
82,"My procedure - a drain plug closure of an enterocutaneous fistula -
appears to have gone smoothly this morning. It took about an
hour. The doctors, nurses, technicians and other staff at
Hopkins continue to be unfailingly skilled, kind, and highly
professional. The small fistula had not closed on its own so Dr.
Holly closed it. I will have a CT scan in about two weeks in
State College to see whether the repair has 'held' (as
mentioned, this procedure has about a 2/3 success rate). I was
also delighted to say good riddance to my 'appendage' - the
stomach drain and drainage bag that I've needed to flush and
clean twice a day and that have dangled from me for several
months. Reinsertion of this tube, however, is not off the table
if fluid begins to collect again in my stomach.
For every bit of good news - and there were certainly some to be
                       300 / 1.901
glad about on this visit - more questions, it seems. A second
radiologist's report of my PET-CT scan confirmed the results of
the preliminary report: there are two 'suspicious' areas (one
where my small and large intestines meet, the other in my lung)
that may or may not be cancerous. The CT scan in two weeks
should help clarify the situation. Dr. Holly (and Dr. Patel)
believe the first area of concern, in the abdomen, is due to
inflammation. We'll see. In the meantime, as my aunt Marlene
wisely advised in response to my post yesterday, I will not
""borrow worries"" (as challenging as that might be). As she
further noted, correctly: ""This is a tricky disease.""
In what Dr. Beavis terms ""great news!!,"" though, my CA125 number
(a marker for ovarian cancer) has dropped 50%, from 51 to 26,
and is now in what she identifies as the ""normal"" range (as
opposed to what Dr. Patel referred to as a ""worrisome"" range).
While this is only one indicator for ovarian cancer, it's an
important one, and my number has not been this low in months. So
a big yay for that.
While I bounced back pretty quickly from the 'twilight' sedation
I had administered for the procedure this morning (after which
my mother and I enjoyed a tasty lunch at a great local place,
Atwater's), I'm feeling rather drained from the past few days
and all the medical ""stuff."" I am eager to get back to PA
tomorrow and chill for a while before school starts on the 13th.
I figure that I once again have a little 'reprieve' until my CT
scan in a few weeks, during which time I can revel in feeling
'normal.' Perhaps I have also exhausted (and/or bored) *you*
with these laborious descriptions of my medical condition, but
it can become quite all-consuming. Thank you, as ever, for

83,"As if I didn't have enough on my hands medically, on Monday I fell in my house and
chipped a bone in my ankle! I was having a pretty crummy day to begin with -- receiving
an astronomical medical bill put me in a rotten mood -- when I got up from the chair I
had been sitting in for quite a while as I was working at my computer. No sooner had I
extended my right foot than I found myself tumbling down onto the wood floor, winding
up in a sort of contorted position with my right ankle and elbow and my left knee hitting
the floor, hard, and leaving me stunned. I surmise that the neuropathy (nerve damage)
in my toes, a lasting side effect of chemo, made me lose my balance. I went to the
urgent care clinic the next day, had my ankle and foot xrayed, and learned that I had an
avulsion fracture, a small fracture that can occur when a small fragment of bone chips
off a larger one. I'm in an air cast, can walk (or rather hobble) and drive. Tomorrow
morning I'll go to the orthopedist, see if they need to put me in another cast (please, no
plaster!) and learn how long this may take to heal. I've read that most often this type of
fracture heals on its own. Please, no surgery!! I'm not in pain, and thank goodness I

didn't hit my head or my side where I've just had a procedure last Friday. But the 'lesson
to self' is that I need to be careful getting up if I've been sitting a long time because my
toes tend to feel numb by that point. Oy.
Somehow this last incident has made me reach for black humor, instead of tears. I don't
know if this is healthier, but it just *is.* No pity party. The first image that came to mind
was that of the Black Knight in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ ,valiantly (or
foolishly??) continuing to fight his opponent despite having each of his limbs whacked off
in succession (you must watch this iconic clip if you never have):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmInkxbvlCs
Next, I began singing, as loudly as I could, Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" and then,
perhaps more appropriately, Steven Sondheim's lyrics to ""I'm Still Here"" from _Follies,_
with several lines that rang particularly true to me:
I've run the gamut, A to Z
Three cheers and dammit, c'est la vie
I got through all of last year
And I'm here
You want to take my ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes? Go right ahead. A piece of my
colon? Why not. Gall bladder? No problem. And throw in my appendix while you're at it.
I'm still here.
The word from my ""contemplation deck"" that's been staring at me the past few days is
""strength."" Physically, I've certainly been stronger than I am currently (although my
energy and activity levels continue to be good); and I'm so disappointed that my plans to
restart a serious exercise program will now need to once again be on hold for a bit. But
'strength' is also mental and psychic toughness. When the going gets tough, the tough
get going. Maybe it's what the French call ""le moral,"" a psychological state that allows
one to confront difficulties and challenges. When I wrote to my editor in Paris, Corinne, to
wish her a happy new year and update her on my health, she responded that she hoped
I had ""le moral"" to get through this difficult period. She knows something about this. At
my last meeting with her, she was the one wearing the wig during her treatment for
breast and kidney cancer. Yet there she was at her desk in her office, reviewing captions
for the illustrations for my book, toughing it out. Later, over drinks at a cafe, she
introduced me to her partner, another cancer survivor, before the two of them sped off
on his motorcycle. Over a year later, she's still here.
So please no pity but good vibes welcome for my orthopedist appointment tomorrow and
then next Friday the 17th's follow up CT scan, bookending the first week of the semester

84,"Just a quick update for those of you kind enough to follow my travails. I am back from
the orthopedist, where I received some further clarification on what happened when I
fell: basically, I sprained my ankle but when the ligaments pulled (which is the essence
of a sprain), they chipped off one and likely two tiny (no long than 3 mm) fragments of
bone from larger pieces on the right side of my foot and ankle. These should heal on
their own; the bone won't regenerate (at least I don't think it will) nor will the fragments
reattach to the bone; they simply get absorbed into tissue. No plaster cast necessary
(yay) nor any surgery (yay). Instead, their orthotics guy fitted me with a boot that I need
to wear as much as possible to immobilize my foot. The injury should heal in about a
month max. I will be checked again in 2-3 weeks to see how things are progressing. I
might need some physical therapy after that to recover range of motion.
The boot is extremely unwieldy and heavy and not conducive to walking; I can drive if I
take it off. My first reaction when I saw it was: ""This thing is the antithesis of sexy."" (""I'm
                       308 / 1.901
too sexy for my boot, too sexy for my boot, too sexy woot woot?""). I've tried my best to
rock a bald head and no eyebrows, a port, and a torso length scar, but rocking this
clunky thing is going to be a challenge. Moreover, because the boot sits on a raised
platform, I also received a matching platform thingy to affix to my left shoe, so that my
hips and back don't get out of whack. Oy. To be honest, I feel like a bit of a hot mess
right now but expect to be back to fighting form soon. I would be grateful for a rapid
return to wholeness of body and no more mishaps. It certainly could be worse.",1,disgust,0.31945476,0.027990693,0.31945476,0.092277534,0.0041271206,0.30103114,0.22542882,0.029689943
85,"Even after thirty-three years in my current job, I still get anxious before the first day of
the semester, and this one is no exception. I can tell, because I have not been sleeping
well for about a week. It takes me a long time to fall asleep because my thoughts are
careening out of control and once I do fall asleep, I doze lightly.
Something feels different this semester, though, and of course it is. I am not returning
from a 'normal' leave but from a medical one and - without any exaggeration -- from a
sometimes harrowing journey that feels a million miles removed from the bulk of my life
experience. It makes me think about -- without the slightest pretense *whatsoever* to
compare -- survivors returning from the camps, many of whose accounts I've read, and
whose feelings of alienation, of inability to communicate the hell they'd been through,
whose extreme difficulties reinserting themselves into their now foreign-seeming
routines, are palpable in their writings. I know this is a somewhat irrational fear on my
part: I can't wait to see my colleagues, our office staff, and students, who I'm sure will
greet me with open arms and who have shown unfailing kindness towards me. While I'm
not teaching this semester, I'm really hoping I can be productive and helpful to my
                       310 / 1.901
department -- there is some fear of feeling irrelevant. Yet I can't help feeling, too, that
my cancer has made me cross some invisible threshold, to a realm perhaps only (or
best) understood by those who have been there. So it's no wonder I can't sleep. I hope
these feelings will dissipate the further I delve into the semester.
And of course I'm very anxious about my upcoming scan on Friday and praying that it
does not reveal a recurrence. And if it does, what will that mean above all for my
prognosis but also for my engagement with the semester that will have just gotten up
and running? So....much...uncertainty. Don't borrow worries, don't borrow worries. For
now, I will simply look forward to an enjoyable and productive week ahead, doing what I
love.
I'm still in my boot, likely for the next two weeks, but so be it. When I remove the boot
and walk gingerly, I can tell that my foot/ankle are healing. It can't happen any more
quickly.

Today about six of my colleagues were crammed into one of our offices to enjoy lunch,
lively convo and after lunch expresso. I'm so lucky to have such a convivial and
supportive work environment. And not being cooped up at home is, as a dear former
student remarked in a comment on my previous post, a ""breath of fresh air."" My energy
level has been fine and it's felt great to be able to write several letters of

even worked for about an hour on the 1899 Vever diary that I'm editing and hope to

examine. I have to be at the medical center at 7:30 (an ungodly hour for me), to drink

88,"I don't yet have an update to share about this morning's CT scan. I could barely sleep
due to anxiety, amplified by a text received from Penn State at 1 a.m. warning of icy
road conditions. The road in front of my house had not been plowed by 6 a.m., when I
woke up, so I took a cab to Geisinger (and an Uber back). I was there by 7:30 to ingest
the yucky drink over the next hour and a half, and then had the scan (I've had so many
of them by this point that I'm an expert at submitting to them!). I was disappointed that
Geisinger would not upload the images to the Hopkins image sharing website whose
address I gave them, for fear of viruses. This would have enabled my Hopkins doctors to
read/view the images today. The nurse did say she sent the images to Hopkins via a
program called Life Image but Dr. Beavis' nurse at Hopkins said she had no idea what
this is. Frustrating. In the end, I had to mail the disc containing the images via overnight
express mail, with a tracking number. Further, the nurse told me that a Geisinger
radiologist would likely not read and complete a report for up to a week! I'm hoping in
that case that the Hopkins radiologists will simply take the lead here. So I may not know
anything for a few days. My right side (the 'troublesome' side) feels a bit sore, as
mentioned, and is not getting better, so the sooner the images can be read the better.
There is not much else I can do while waiting, unless I really start to feel worse.
Meanwhile, I will try to have a calm (and calming) weekend. As I'm tired and there are
still patchy spots on the road, I think I'll work at home this afternoon, with a quick
Wegman's run at some point to stock up for the next big snow, due -- tomorrow! Thanks
to everyone for all the caring texts, FB messages, well wishes, prayers etc.

89,"My apologies for the air waves going silent for the past several days, and thank you so
much for your inquiries about the results of my CT scan. In what my mother rightly calls
'disc-gate,' the disc I sent to Hopkins last Friday, immediately after my scan, and which
was supposed to arrive the next day, only reached Dr. Beavis' office TODAY, five days
later. Apparently, per USPS, it arrived in Baltimore yesterday but Dr. Beavis' office had
no idea where it was to be retrieved. As mentioned, Geisinger in State College did not
want to upload the images electronically to Hopkins' website for fear of viruses. In the
meanwhile, I could have made several round trips to Baltimore to hand deliver the disc! I
was in my car headed to Geisinger on my lunch break today to pick up two new copies of
the disc (was not going to take any chances with just one copy), when Dr. Beavis' office
called to let me know it had arrived. I will spare all the additional details that conspired
to cause such an anxiety-provoking delay.
I have no other news to report. I presume that I'll be contacted once Drs. Beavis and
Holly have looked at and discussed the imaging. I am still quite anxious but being at
work has been a great diversion.
As if my day could not have started out any more tensely, as I was driving to work this
morning, having figured out my plan regarding the AWOL disc, what did I see in my rear
view mirror but... a cop car with flashing lights. Oh my. I pulled over and got out my
license, insurance and registration cards. Unfortunately, as I knew, I am overdue for my
yearly inspection. I was scheduled for it last week but the fractured bone in my ankle
(which is, incidentally, healing well) really put the kibosh on my walking the quarter mile
or so from my garage to my office, so I cancelled the appointment. I do realize that I
should have taken care of this earlier and will make sure to get it done asap. The young
officer -- to whom I showed my big clunky boot as 'evidence' -- was very polite and gave
me a citation, not a ticket -- but still. Not what I needed.",2,fear,0.8391744,0.015823347,0.0027573998,0.8391744,0.004341939,0.042417184,0.028887458,0.06659833

There is some very good news and some less good news.
The very good, indeed excellent news, per Dr. Beavis in my phone conversation with her
today about the results of my CT scan, is that there appears to be no recurrence of
cancer; ""nothing alarming,"" she said, based on the Geisinger radiologist's report and her
own viewing of the images (which the Hopkins radiologists have not yet looked at). The
'suspicious' spot (pleural effusion) on my lung is, in fact, tiny and apparently not a cause
for concern; the other 'suspicious' area on my right side is due to inflammation and what
I will discuss below. I was extremely worried that my cancer might have spread to my
lung, which would of course be very serious. I was consumed with anxiety, imagining my
aggressive cancer cells running amok in my body. Since November, then, I have
apparently remained in the clear, with NED (no evidence of disease). Praise be.
Less fortunately, fluid is still amassing on my right side, near my fistula. The procedure
to close that fistula, which I had performed at Hopkins on Jan. 3, was not a success (in
part due to the new fluid collection). This means that I still have a hole between my
abdomen and my bowel, with the risk (small but still there) of sepsis, infection and other
awful things. This leaves me with two options. I can have a new stomach drain placed
(likely this week at Hopkins, and hopefully during the first part of the week as we have a
series of job candidates coming to campus beginning next Thursday); then, in four
weeks, Dr. Holly can attempt the procedure again. Two weeks after that, as was the case
this time, I'll have another CT scan to see if the procedure was successful. My doctors
seem to me pessimistic about the procedure working this time. It has a 2/3 success rate
in the best of circumstances (ie no fluid collection), but given that it didn't work the first
time, my odds are likely slimmer, although not non-existent. Dr. Beavis said that it would
probably be like ""kicking the can"" down the road, with surgery likely eventually.
However, it still might work and would also provide me with about 6-8 weeks of relative
'normalcy' as I am just getting into a groove at work and with other aspects of my life.
Dr. Beavis understands how important these 'quality of life' issues can be (and are, for
me). At the same time, she would like me to, in her words, ""have this whole episode
[concerning the fistula and the fluid collection] behind me.""
I could also opt for surgery right away or, as mentioned, surgery if the procedure fails. I
will need to meet soon with the colorectal surgeon, Dr. Sandy Fang, but as I understand
it, this surgery might be (partly?) laparoscopic or not; might involve removing another
part of my colon or not; and might involve placing an ostomy bag *temporarily* or not. It
will depend on how things look inside, including the extent of adhesions etc. I will need
to ask more questions about the surgery, including amount of recuperation necessary.
But it is likely that there's another surgery in my (not terribly distant) future.
I am strongly leaning towards trying the procedure again both so I can attempt the less
invasive option first and so I can keep building on my newfound momentum at school
and elsewhere.
                       321 / 1.901
I will need to (re)gird on patience and fortitude for the next hurdles, while hopefully not
backsliding out of the 'new normal' it's taken me so long to claw my way back into and
where I am so very happy to find myself again.
I am grateful that I was able to come down from my stress cloud over a nice glass of red,
some cheese and other nibbles, and calming and fun conversation with my friend Helen
this evening. I realize that I've been holding a lot of anxiety this week, much as I've been
trying to refocus my energies and attention elsewhere.
Many thanks to everyone for the care and concern. With love,",2,fear,0.94908893,0.002833899,0.0021974854,0.94908893,0.002600309,0.021291101,0.0045707906,0.017417567

home from work and errands (7:00 p.m.) -- I am not complaining about this new
schedule! -- and need to make dinner and pack. I'll be heading to Baltimore tomorrow for
two appointments at Hopkins on Wednesday: at 9:15 I'll meet with Dr. Sandy Fang, a
colorectal surgeon, for a consult about the surgery that it seems like I may have to have
sooner or later to remove (?) or repair a sinus tract (per woundsource.com, ""a narrow
opening or passageway extending from a wound underneath the skin in any direction through soft
tissue and results in dead space with potential for abscess formation""). I'm sure I'll find out more

about the surgery when I speak with Dr. Fang and ask all my questions. At 4:30 I am having the
procedure to place a drain into the abscess that has reformed in my abdomen. This is at least the
second, if not the third time I've had this procedure It will be performed by Dr. Holly, the wonderful
interventional radiologist who also performed the procedure to attempt to plug my fistula (even though
that procedure did not succeed, I still think he's an excellent doctor, as they all seem to be at
Hopkins). I hope to leave Hopkins on Thursday morning with clarity about the best path forward for
me, ie second attempt at the fistula plug v. straight to surgery. The fact that I'm really getting into a
groove at work and in other aspects of my life is a big factor for me, but I won't do anything to
jeopardize my health.
For me, these are simply hurdles to jump over in this 'marathon.' These hurdles pale in comparison
with those directly related to the cancer (eg debulking, chemo etc.). Unpleasant as what's upcoming
is, I can handle it. Dr. Patel (or another doctor) had warned me that this was going to be a ""long
haul."" 
I will be infinitely comforted by, and grateful for my brother's presence in Baltimore on Wednesday.
He very kindly again offered to come down on W to be with me for the procedure (in any event, I need
someone with me as I'll be sedated. Hopefully, we'll have a nice dinner that evening and catch up,

92,"I am facing another major surgery before too long. This was what I came away with after
a two-night stay in Baltimore full of twists and turns, uncertainty, and stress, along with a
bright spot or two.
                       325 / 1.901
To begin at the beginning: on Wednesday morning I had an appointment with Sandy
Fang, a colorectal surgeon, to discuss surgery to repair or eradicate my the
fistula/abscess/inflammation in my abdomen. I was at that point going with the idea that
surgery might be a second option, following a second attempt to plug the fistula
laparoscopically. Unfortunately, Dr. Fang was running about 45 minutes late, which in
the end left us only a rushed 30 minutes before I had to go to another building for my
procedure (stomach drain placement); watching the time slip away as I waited for her
was quite stressful, as I had driven 3.5 hours for this appointment. In the half hour we
had together, she began to explain what the surgery would entail, and she asked me
some questions and examined me. However, she stated that she would be fine with my
trying the less invasive fistula plug procedure first. She said it would be important to first
drain as much fluid as possible from the abscess, to create the 'cleanest' possible
environment for possible surgery, so she was intent as I was on getting me to my next
appointment on time. I tried to get a sense of possible timetable, length of recuperation
etc. but she wanted to first explain the operation to me. She kindly offered to meet with
me again the following morning at 9:00, so we could have a more in-depth conversation
and so she could answer my questions.
I hustled over to the Zayed building to check in for my stomach drain placement. The
very nice nurse who had attended to me last time I was at Hopkins (earlier this month) --
her name is Lisa  -- saw my name on the list of patients for the day and ""chose"" me. I felt
happy and relieved to see her again and we chatted about our kids, thoughts about
eventual retirement (we're about the same age), etc. as she placed an i.v. and started an
antibiotic drip, covered me with warm blankets etc. Dr. Holly, the interventional
radiologist who attempted to plug my fistula earlier this month, came by to say hello and
to explain that he would be (re)inserting a stomach drainage bag in an attempt to reduce
inflammation on my right side as a prelude to making a second attempt to plug the
fistula in a few weeks. One of the fellows assisting Dr. Holly on the procedure also came
by to introduce himself and to say ""we'll take good care of you."" I continue to feel that,
overall, I'm in excellent, skilled and compassionate hands at Hopkins. At around noon I
was wheeled into the procedure room (I remember looking up at the white ceiling while
machines whirred around me and thinking: ""Sometimes I still can't believe all this is
happening to me...""). The fellow (I didn't catch his name) performed a sonogram to
locate the abscess into which the drain would be placed and he and Dr. Holly looked at
the screen together. Meanwhile, a nurse administered a sedative cocktail (Fentanyl and
something else) that made me....very ...drowsy.
I woke up disoriented back in the recovery bay. No drain. Dr. Holly came in shortly
thereafter, looking slightly flustered, to explain that he had not been able  to perform the
procedure as the fluid collection was too small; this is not what Dr. Beavis had led me to
believe from the CT scan, but I understand that once Dr. Holly and his team 'went in' to
actually try to insert a tube into the abscess, it was a different story. There were three
                       326 / 1.901
puncture marks on my right side where the team had tried to access the abscess. Dr.
Holly said something like: ""I'm sorry I wasn't able to do it. There's something else going
on here [>at the time that sounded ominous to me]. There's nothing more I can do for
you."" Thus ended the possibility of option #1, ie stomach drain leaving only option #2:
surgery.
So it was back to Dr. Fang for the follow-up appointment the next morning. I was very
glad that Dr. Beavis also joined us, as she happened to be free that morning.  We spent
about an hour together, with Dr. Fang explaining in detail (with the aid of a drawing and
my CT scan images, which had never really been shown to me with explanations before)
what the surgery would entail. To my surprise (or was I simply in denial?), the surgery is
much more of a big deal than I had imagined. It is major abdominal surgery. Urological
(?) surgeons will first have to place stents in my ureters to make sure no urine seeps into
the abdomen. Then Dr. Beavis will need to see if there is any cancer for her to remove.
This gave me a sinking feeling. I was reminded that cancer under a certain dimension (1
mm?) does not show up on a CT scan and that there was a bit of cancer she was unable
to remove in May (but hopefully the chemo got it). Then Dr. Fang will remove the entire
'problem' area (fistula, sinus tract, abscess). I will not be able to describe the procedure
in as much technical detail as Dr. Fang did, but of course this involves complex issues
regarding blood supply, adhesions, what she called 'tension' (of the tissue?), etc. Another
piece of my colon and small intestine (I think) will be removed (following those removed
last May). Complications could arise if there is cancer in the area to be removed (will
need to review my notes on this); if cancer winds up being removed during the
operation, it will likely be followed (once I recover) by more chemo. In the absolute worst
case scenario, I could wind up with a permanent ostomy bag; in better (less bad??)
scenarios, I might have a temporary otsomy bag. Then there will be a hospital stay, like
last time, with the whole shebang (pain management for abdominal pain, goals to meet
before I can be released, like eating without nausea or vomiting) and recuperation at
home, no driving for six weeks etc. Dr. Beavis implied that I might ""lose"" my spring to
get back on track for summer and fall. Also, I can expect to lose 10-15% of my body
weight because I won't feel like eating.  
I don't yet know about timetable. I am now on antibiotics for two weeks to try to reduce
inflammation before having another CT scan. My right side feels uncomfortable because
of the inflammation, which Dr. Fang showed me on the CT scan, describing it as a 'rind.'
If the antibiotics seem to be effective, we'll probably wait a while longer before surgery.
So I'm in a holding pattern for at least two weeks and will be delighted to dive back into
work and my other activities during that time. 
Of course, I felt sort of numb receiving all this news and I'll need to write more about my
reactions another time as I have to move on to other things soon. I felt somewhat
'retraumatized' breaking the news to my family and feeling their distress (which I always
feel responsible for, even though I know that this whole cancer thing is just plain 'ole
                       327 / 1.901
dumb luck of the genetic draw...). What I need to keep in mind is a)as Dr. Beavis said,
the expectation is that this surgery will resolve once and for all this complication (she
explained what would happen if I didn't have it; infected fluid from the abscess would
eventually start seeping out of my skin.....) and b) I am in much better shape physically
than when I had my debulking surgery last May, when my body was full of cancer.
The brightest spot of the trip, and certainly not a negligible one, was having my dearest
'people' with me. My brother's presence is so comforting. We had breakfast in the hotel
(after he made a Starbucks run for us) and schmoozed about cars, Kobe and our kids. It
didn't matter that I was still a bit loopy from my sedation. And Wednesday night Ben
came from DC for dinner! Ben and his uncle Ethan are close, which is lovely to see. The
three of us went to a cute cafe in Fells Point called Water for Chocolate. I was so happy
to hug and kiss my son. ""May you walk with good companions.""

                       331 / 1.901
I was groomed for success. I was groomed to have it all. From my privileged private
school education in New York, which honed the intellect and confidence of young women
before launching them to the top colleges and universities in the country, to Harvard, to
graduate school at NYU, where it was perhaps implicit -- for better or worse -- that I
would follow in my father's own successful academic career, to realizing that expectation
(more modestly, but that's another story) over my thirty + years at Penn State, nothing
seemed beyond reach. I cultivated my career with single-minded grit and determination
because, as a Harvard friend highly impressive for her own career as a dean of a top
business school in Japan remarked to me in a text (as she was en route to the economic
summit in Davos), ""in our professions work is not just a job but life."" Month-long trips to
Paris, other travel, frequent trips 'home' to New York or to see Ben in DC, pricey haircuts,
cute clothes, and other forms of pampering were only a click of a credit card away. As for
the proverbial work-life balance, I've been blessed to be a mother (and have done pretty
well in that capacity, if I may). Marital/romantic relationships may have proved slightly
more challenging but certainly within reach, buttressed by many beautiful moments. 
And so this is why I was teary last night, as the debate in NH droned on in the
background. Adjusting (lowering?) expectations is hard. 'Acceptance' is hard, even after
sixty years of experiencing abundant privilege and opportunity that should be more than
enough for one lifetime. Even gratitude for what remains is hard. I sit in my office,
overjoyed to be back at work and grateful for the modified responsibilities this semester
that have allowed me to continue my recovery while working, yet sad that I'm not in the
classroom, as I normally would be. I'm depressed that I can't yet make plans to go to
France (or anywhere) this summer as things are on hold until a timetable for my next
surgery is determined and while the specter of again losing a 'season' hangs over me.
I know I will return to appreciating the 'new normal.' I know that gratitude for what is will
again flood my heart. I know that I'll again return to the conviction that giving up a trip is
a small price to pay for the hope of quality and quantity of life. But it's still hard.
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time,
I am feeling ok overall. My sleep is so-so. I have discomfort on my right side, where the
problematic fistula/abscess are located. I am somewhat doubtful that the strong
antibiotics I am taking to reduce the inflammation on my side are working. My CT scan
this coming Thursday will help determine the path forward medically. And here comes
                       332 / 1.901
the scanxiety: will any new cancer show up on the CT scan? Is any lurking, eluding
detection? Damn this parasite that is lying in wait, destroying what I need to live.
Meanwhile, my energy level has been really pretty high. I had a productive week at work,
at the office from about 9:30 to 5 or 6 each day. It is such a pleasure to cram into my
colleague's office once or twice a week for lunch with one or more other colleagues (who
are all friends) and dish about what we are reading for fun, our latest makeup purchases,
our kids, and goings on in the department. I had a great convo over dinner with a job
candidate. Enjoyed another dinner and a lunch out with friends. Per tradition, taking my
friend Monique out for brunch tomorrow for our bdays (she's Feb. 4th, I'm March 4th) and
then going to see ""Parasite"" with Maria, as it's been highly recommended. Treated
myself to breakfast this morning at a cute cafe in town and enjoyed a hearty meal (eggs,
pancake, oj, cappuccino) while reading a magazine.
Had a lovely day in Harrisburg last Sunday with a new friend, brunching at Rubicon in a
sweet little townhouse, further relaxing over a coffee at Little Amps, right near the
Capitol, then taking a stroll by the Suquehanna (see pic). Simple pleasures like getting to
know another person will always be wondrous to me. Resolutely seeking out and reveling
in human connection has always been my m.o. But now it's also part of my f*** you to
cancer. Yes, grateful for the moment.
“Because I know that time is always time
And place is always and only place
And what is actual is actual only for one time
And only for one place

I renounce the blessed face and
I renounce the voice

due to the fistula/abscess, plus a perception of slight (?) bloating in my abdomen (a
telltale sign for ovarian cancer), I had convinced myself that new tumors were growing
and pressing into me. I do need to stress that there may well be some microscopic
cancer floating around inside me, and that the CA125 marker is not the 'be all and end
all' of cancer detection, but I'm nevertheless, for today, holding onto this bit of good

95,"In the hall of fame (or notoriety) of tragicomic first encounters marking the flurry of
online dating into which I plunged post-divorce (now ten years ago!), there were some
real doozies (in all fairness, I must say that there were many lovely first dates too - some
of you know who you are! :) -- and on the rare occasions I take a peek online these days
I'm much more discriminating). Someday, maybe, I'll write about all these fellows, using
a title suggested by a friend who knows of what she speaks: Some College (this an
allusion to an educational status that people may select for their profiles). There was (in
                       337 / 1.901
no particular order): Guy Obsessed with Disney; Anger Issues Guy; the Republican; Guy
who Accused me of being a Cougar; Nasty Basketball Coach; Guy who Declined to Spend
the Night, Citing a Flatulence Problem; and Guy who Refused to Date Women too Uptight
to use Sh** and F** in the same Sentence (ok, I borrowed that last one from a friend).
But, when we tell the tales among girlfriends, the one that always elicits a stone cold
silence, followed by a muffled, embarrassed guffaw, is Guy who Died. Guy who Died was
a retired professor, perhaps in his 60s (or maybe 70s) at a local university (not Penn
State), with whom I exchanged several pleasant enough emails. We agreed to meet for
coffee. Several days later, before we had even met, I opened my local newspaper, only
to discover, in the Obituaries section, that my prospective date had died! No cause of
death was cited, only information about the funeral, his next of kin, and a brief bio
(incidentally, my experience echoes an episode of Sex and the City, in which Miranda is
stood up for a date, only to find out that he has died of a heart attack, then only to
attend the wake and see that the prospective date was very cute, and then only to pick
up another guy at the wake). So maybe this is a.... thing?
Did my Guy who Died pass suddenly, of a heart attack? Or rather did he know he was
about to die and, in the face of death, courageously cling to the hope of life and love, up
until the end?
I've thought a lot about him recently. In the fantasy I have spun around him (which may,
I realize, contain a fair amount of projection on my part), he knew he was to die soon.
While I hope and expect this is not my case, I too have found, when confronted up close
and personal with at least the specter of death, as serious illness tends to do, a strong
desire (and ability) to love fiercely and purely and hopefully. As if the essence of life
could be distilled into love, which is timeless, and therefore, in some sense, a guarantee
of life eternal. While Freud (about whom I""m surely no expert...) wrote of the primal
urges of Eros (the life urge, including libido and sexuality but also other forms of love)
and Thanatos (the destructive urge) that exist in each person, I see them intertwined
differently. ""Love never fails"" (1 Corinthians: 8), even -- especially - in the face or the
wake of death.
So let's hear it for the Guy who Died. And let's be cheerleaders for love.

My CT scan on Thursday went smoothly (although it's a tiring, all-morning ordeal) and I
managed to upload the 600+ images to Hopkins' image-sharing site for the doctors to
view. No word yet. I'm feeling a bit frustrated that Dr. Fang, the colorectal surgeon who
ordered the scan and who will likely perform the projected fistula operation along with
                       338 / 1.901
Dr. Beavis, has not responded to my emails. While very friendly and while she spent a
good amount of time with me at Hopkins explaining the upcoming procedure and
answering all my questions, she also made it clear that she is deluged with emails and
requests for consults from all over the country... So I will need to be more proactive in
making sure she remains responsive to me. Dr. Beavis is out of the country until this
coming week, so I'm presuming I'll hear from her then. I will see my medical oncologist
here, Dr. Patel, on Monday, so I can also share my concerns with him. Meanwhile, the
discomfort in my side and abdomen is more or less manageable depending on the day
(Ibuprofen helps) but clearly needs medical attention.
I queried a few trusted friends about the need for such major abdominal surgery.
However, this is a case in which it would be helpful for me to avail myself of a caregiver
who could do some research for me; I'm doing it all myself as I also work full time now
etc. So I'm doing the best I can -- but no pity party. My friend Marty, a scientist who
teaches at Penn State and whose wife succumbed to ovarian cancer eight years after her
diagnosis, shared that Wendy had six operations but bounced back after each one to a
very good quality of life. My (ex)-bro-in-law, David, a gastroenterologist, said that
surgery seems a reasonable option at this point given that draining the abscess and the
laparoscopic procedure to plug the fistula both failed. He did reassure me, in the case
that I would need an ostomy bag (temporary or permanent), that many people have
them and that it winds up not being a big deal to them. This was quite reassuring. But a
permanent bag would be worst case scenario only.
I had a full week at work interviewing a visiting job candidate, working on projects for the
department, seeing a student or two, writing recommendations, meeting with the
current and former deans of our College, doing some research etc. and I held up well.
Still very glad to be back at work, feeling productive and purposeful. Looking forward to
tea this afternoon with my friend Clare and maybe our friend Lisa as well.",5,sadness,0.47633398,0.009036599,0.010251174,0.016802061,0.0074351183,0.12880515,0.47633398,0.35133597
96,"As I was about to leave the office today to go meet my friend Helen for Mexican dinner at
Lupita's, my cell phone rang. It was Dr. Sandy Fang, the colorectal surgeon at Hopkins,
who had ordered the CT scan I had last Thursday and whose results I had been anxiously
awaiting since then, all the while sending multiple emails via MyChart to make sure the
images had reached the right hands and been read by the right pairs of eyes.
I am feeling more reassured now, not because anything has changed in terms of the
need for what Dr. Fang termed a ""big surgery"" but because a plan is now emerging. It's
the uncertainty that really unsettles me; yesterday afternoon, my therapist and I
discussed to what extent my anxiety *might* be aggravating the significant abdominal
discomfort I've been having recently, which I've been attributing exclusively to my
fistula/abscess or else to *imagined* problems, such as new tumors pressing on my rib
cage and into my abdomen, blockages etc. All these fantasies had been coalescing in my
mind during what may be (in my analysis of the situation) a kind of retraumatization (a
word?) I'm experiencing with the one-year anniversary of my diagnosis on the horizon
(but not until April, in fact). After my discussion w/Dr. Fang, however, presto! my
stomach somehow feels better, 'lighter.' Not all better, for sure, but just more ... at ease.
Dr. Fang told me that the new CT scan imaging has not significantly changed since my
second to last CT scan two weeks prior. That was a relief, dispelling the fantasy of large
new tumors growing, blockages forming etc. She also said that she did not see any new
cancer in the images - relief - but that she would let Dr. Beavis weigh in on that. She said
that people with my condition, ie with a fistula/abscess in the abdomen, often feel pretty
crappy - also somewhat of a relief as this explains why I've been feeling...pretty crappy.
Finally, she reassured me of her competence/experience/expertise, as well as that of Dr.
Beavis -- also a relief, as I had mistakenly thought I had heard her say during our last
meeting at Hopkins that she had not operated on a case exactly like mine. This turns out
to not be true. She has performed many such surgeries, and many of them on cancer
patients. She and Dr. Beavis often operate together. She assured me that she would take
                       341 / 1.901
good care of me, although of course there are always risks with such a big surgery. But I
place my trust in these two very talented young women and the rest of the staff at
Hopkins.
We talked about projected dates for the surgery. It will depend on the coordination of Dr.
Beavis' calendar w/Dr. Fang's (they are both very busy and in demand), but I was glad
that she asked me to weigh in too. I asked that she spare me from the knife on my
birthday (4 March), but suggested that the week of spring break (the week of March 9)
might be possible. After saying that, I wondered if I should try to preserve my spring
break to take a week to relax and get a change of scene before surgery, but then
wondered about my potential for relaxation under such circumstances. I guess the
sooner I can have the surgery done the sooner I can start recovering, and since I'm on a
good roll with work I hope I'll be able to continue working at home while I recuperate. I
guess there is no optimal time for the surgery. It also depends, Dr. Fang said, on how
symptomatic I am. As mentioned, my abdomen has been feeling uncomfortable but with
the plan in place I'm banking on it not feeling as bad, and I have a few nice events to
look forward to, beginning with Ben and Sammi being in State College this coming
weekend. :)
It is still lovely to be at work. My colleagues are so kind, so pleasant. A few of us have
been having lunch in one of our offices on MWFs, complete with a delicious espresso
made for us by the dear colleague, Heather, whose office we use for our gatherings. It's
always convivial and there are lots of laughs. I do miss teaching though. Good motivation
to get better soon!",5,sadness,0.7900332,0.002176308,0.011682274,0.015904728,0.11352327,0.05761448,0.7900332,0.009065673
97,"A very pleasant and fun weekend lifted my spirits, as I await word regarding the date of
my surgery; I really hope to have this nailed down soon and will contact my Hopkins
doctors tomorrow.
Friday I left work around 4 to grocery shop in anticipation of Ben and Sammi's arrival for
the weekend and a friend coming up from Baltimore for the day on Sunday. At Wegman's
I ran into a friend I had not seen in several years who told me that shortly after he
learned about my diagnosis from a coworker, his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer
and that he's had to hold down the fort (including caring for a two-year-old) while his
wife has undergone treatment. He told me that he'd been following my CB page in order
to know what to anticipate: chemo (in his wife's case overseen also by Dr. Patel, who
seems to treat nearly every cancer patient in town), a trip to the 'wig lady,' etc. I am
terribly sad for what he and his family are going through, but happy that my blog may
have provided some small measure of help. Cancer automatically creates bonds between
people - we're in the club no one wants to belong to, and we need to be there for each
                       343 / 1.901
other. My friend and I hugged warmly when saying goodbye.
It was of course really wonderful to have Ben and Sammi stay over both Friday and
Saturday nights. Now that I subscribe to NYTimes recipes, I made an easy but very tasty
baked salmon dish, in a glaze with honey, apple cider vinegar, soy sauce and jalapenos,
served w/basmati rice and some sauteed spinach. After dinner we all went to the
Creamery, where we laughed about ingesting so much sugar and cream that we were all
three nearly in shock! Clearly, my appetite is no longer failing me... On Saturday, I had to
be part of a 'ruse' to distract Michael while his house was being readied for his surprise
60th bday party. So we chatted in my living room while Ben took an extra long time
changing light bulbs for me. After they left, I made a quiche with goat cheese and fresh
herbs, some oat scones with cranberries and orange zest, and a beet salad. So glad to
have the energy for this major burst of binge cooking -- and I sent Ben back to DC
w/homemade chicken soup too!
Last night I went to a fun party for 'carnevale.' All the guests wore Carnival masks (some
from Venice) and beads (mine, bought in New Orleans years ago, feature lobsters). We
acted silly and danced up a storm! Again, I surprised myself w/my stamina. It felt so
good to enjoy some spirited partying, the kind I like (even sans alcohol for me...).
Today a friend came up from Baltimore to spend part of the day with me. We had a
lovely brunch that I had prepared, then went to the Palmer Museum, which we visited
pretty thoroughly, then sat outside in the sun at the Creamery, enjoying yet another ice
cream cone. It felt like spring.
My hair has grown enough so that I think this week I will have it colored and trimmed. I
imagine that this will feel quite liberating for me, eliminating the need to rely on a wig.
It's ultra short and I still look somewhat like a porcupine, but I will wear my new 'do'
proudly.
My commitment card word this week (thank you again, Shanny, for this gift) is
'positivity,' as in try to remain in this state. Very important.
Grateful, then, for this weekend. Trying not to waste a minute. Anxious about backsliding
big time with the upcoming surgery (and praying that there will be no need for follow up
chemo if any cancer is found during the surgery). I'll just have to try to get to a good
space mentally and emotionally, be patient and accepting, and keep of the goal summer
trips on the horizon.",5,sadness,0.713302,0.0014851199,0.0015115258,0.00553634,0.19567508,0.020808859,0.713302,0.06168108

Note to self: never read emails in bed on waking up. That's how I found out, in an email
from Dr. Fang, that my surgery has indeed been scheduled for Monday 9 March, which
was later confirmed when I spoke with Val, the nice administrator in her office. 
I don't know why -- or maybe I do -- but that news turned me into a slobbering weepy
mess within minutes. I haven't cried so hard in a long time. I guess it's simply the 'feeling
all the feelings' in a rush: guilt about again causing distress to my loved ones overtook
me while I was sitting in my pjs at the dining room table, eating my scone; next came a
kind of 'holy shit' fear and panic while I was showering (combined with a niggling feeling
that I should update my will before the operation); then huge feelings of disappointment,
sadness and anger at the prospect of again needing to 'step out' of my normal life (yet
what is normal for me anymore?) while the world goes on without me, all the while
desperately wishing I could simply be my usual vibrant, energetic, productive self; then
some confusion about how I should best use the time until the operation (likely simply
hewing to my work/play routine, which suits me just fine). Then there is the
'retraumatization' factor, as memories of physical pain, long recuperation, emotional and
psychological fragility etc. came flooding back. It was so hard, and I just pray that my
body and spirit have the wherewithal to bounce back again.
It will be a big surgery. Per Val, the kind administrator at Hopkins, I will need to be at the
hospital at 5:30 (!!) for a 7:30 operation, scheduled for 6+ hours. So maybe it won't be
as long as that ""mother of all surgeries"" I had last May, but it will be long. Then a ""3+
day"" hospital stay. In addition, I have to go to Hopkins this coming Monday for pre-op
meetings with the anesthesiologist and the ostomy nurse, in case that worse-case
scenario becomes a reality. The night before the surgery I have to do a bowel prep (hope
this is not TMI), which was an absolute horror last May as I was very sick and had a hard
time with it. At least this time I know what to expect, will be in a much better/nicer hotel
than the one we were in last time, and will aim to be calmer. I know the drill.
I am feeling rather frustrated that my surgeons have not seemed as responsive as I'd
like to my requests to speak with them before the operation. Dr. Beavis' nurse ""runs
interference"" for her and won't always forward notes from patients (at least from this
patient). She (Kelly, the nurse) suggested that I really should be talking to Dr. Fang, the
colorectal surgeon. However, I would really like to speak with Dr. Beavis as the doctor
who oversees my care (and who will be present at the operation). I will need to regroup
and try again.
Hold the presses! At the time of this writing, I have indeed spoken with the wonderful,
upbeat Anna Beavis, who called me in my office at about 5 p.m., just as I was getting
ready to leave (and actually just as I was writing the previous paragraph). As usual, she
spent as much time as I needed on the phone, answering all my questions. I took two
                       353 / 1.901
pages of notes, and there's a lot of info to convey, so I'll just condense some of it here:
as with my surgery last May, the type of surgery they will do will depend largely on what
they see when they 'go in.' She laid out three possible scenarios from best to middle-
ground to worst, all depending on a)whether or not they find any cancer in addition to
the fistula, b)where the cancer is located (if they find any), and c)how much they find.
She said my latest CT scan did not reveal any new tumors but, as I've mentioned, below
a certain size some cancer will not show up on the CT scan. What they find will also
determine follow-up: if they find more cancer, I will likely need follow-up chemo. Dr.
Beavis is also monitoring a small amount of fluid in my lung, which has gotten slightly
larger but is still very small. As I'll be pumped with fluids (I think), if it turns out they
need to drain any from my lung (at a later point), they may look at some samples under
a microscope, but during the surgery they'll only be operating on my abdominal area,
not my lung cavity. I asked her whether she thought this big surgery will inhibit my body
from being able to deal with a recurrence if/when that happens and she said she
believed it would *not,* as my body is overall stronger now than it was last May. She also
is prescribing a painkiller to help ease my abdominal discomfort and to tide me over until
the surgery. She told me that she'd be assisting in the surgery from the 'ovarian cancer'
perspective and also as someone who can convey what she understands of my
preferences and wishes to Dr. Fang, ie as a type of 'advocate' for me. That made me feel
good.
I know it's a lot to absorb. Somehow I am not feeling overly anxious now writing about it,
perhaps because I felt better after my convo w/Dr. Beavis. She assured me that she'd
take good care of me. Dr. Fang had told me the same thing. I have to keep in mind that
the goal of this surgery is to permanently resolve this complication from last May's
surgery, so that I can get on with my life. Fingers crossed.
I *did* manage to have a productive day at work today. The brightest spot was having
the president and secretary of the French club, two undergraduates, appear in my office
to offer the faculty a King Cake (Gateaux des rois - sorry for the missing accent on the
'a'), bought at Wegmans (!), to thank the department for providing some monetary and
moral support for the club's upcoming trip to New Orleans over spring break. They were
terrifically sweet to make this gesture. I had totally forgotten that today is Mardi Gras.

100,"Hi everyone,
Greetings from the ER of MNMC (Mount Nittany Medical Center), where I've been laid up
since about ten or so this morning. My abdominal discomfort, coupled with some nausea
and constipation, had been worsening over the past 2-3 days, culminating in a bad night
last night. The discomfort -- actually pain by this point -- was pretty acute: my abdomen
felt as if it were cramping or throbbing, I was burping a lot and felt on the verge of
vomiting. The pain kept waking me up, and of course I was becoming progressively more
anxious.
So I got out of bed at about 6 a.m. and wrote to both Dr. Fang and Dr. Beavis, describing
my symptoms and asking for their advice. Dr. Fang responded quite quickly, advising
that I go to the ER for blood work and a CT scan. I was able to drive myself to the
hospital but was really not feeling well. Fortunately, I did not have to wait long to be
checked in.
I'm being well taken care of here, by both a good ER doc, Eric Feese, and a
compassionate nurse, Carla (I don't know her last name). I had blood drawn to test
kidney function among other things, had a chest x-ray taken as well as an abdominal CT
scan. I've been receiving IV fluids (although I've had nothing to eat nor drink, per
doctor's orders) and some magnesium (as my level was low) by IV too. And I've been
blissed out on morphine all day.
The CT scan revealed that I have an obstruction in my small bowel. It's not large, but
large enough to be causing the pain that I experienced last night. It may be due to scar
tissue, of which much formed after my operation last May. It may resolve on its own, or it
may need to be resolved surgically. Right now, I have an NG tube running through my
nose into my stomach to drain what's above the blockage. Inserting it was painful, and
brought back memories of a host of painful procedures I had to undergo last spring. 
                       356 / 1.901
Dr. Feese spoke with Dr. Fang, who would like me to come to Hopkins for treatment. At 6
p.m. I'll find out whether they have a bed for me there (currently they do not). If so, I'll
be transported there by EMS ambulance (I do have my car here at the hospital and
asked if I could drive myself to Baltimore as I think the transport is expensive, but the
doctor said no way). If a bed doesn't open up today, we'll try again tomorrow. I don't
really know what the plan is, but it sounds like it will entail fixing all the problems at once
(blockage, abscess, fistula etc.). I don't know whether the date for that surgery will be
moved up to earlier than the currently scheduled one on 9 March.
I'm not sure how I am feeling emotionally about these latest developments. I am much
less weepy than yesterday. In fact, I feel pretty calm right now (the morphine helps...),
relieved to be taken care of and to know why I felt so wretched during the night. I'm just
rolling with it for now. As ever, a lovely, loving and supportive email from a friend, which
it looks like she sent at about 5 this morning and which I was thus able to read when I
rose at 6, was a balm to my spirit. Emails, texts and calls throughout the day from a few
friends and of course the family members I was able to update (my mother, brother, Ben
and Michael) also helped settle me. But the whole thing is really a drag....
I will share updates when I can. Pleased that I thought to grab my laptop before I left this
morning, as well as a long novel that I'm engrossed in, but I don't have too much else
with me and have no idea how long I may be away. Thanks to everyone who took the
time to read this entry. I appreciate your well wishes and prayers.",2,fear,0.840354,0.0050102035,0.011738542,0.840354,0.008511388,0.05977298,0.06473394,0.009878863
101,"At least a brief update here as I'm feeling pretty crappy - have had a headache for two
days as I've been NPO (no food or drink, nor for the foreseeable future), feel nauseous,
exhausted (arrived at Hopkins by EMT ambulance around 3:30 this morning) and still
have an NG tube down my nose. On the brighter side, I have less abdominal pain as
they've been draining my stomach.
I am being very well taken care of here, naturally. I'm in a nice recently renovated room
in the historic part of the hospital, on a floor where Saudi princes stay (along with their
security) when they come to be treated here. I saw Dr. Fang this morning and Dr. Beavis
stopped by to chat for quite a while. They will be monitoring me over next few days to
see if the stomach blockage resolves, which is the hope (a good sign is that I have been
able to pass some gas - again, hopefully not TMI here). My big surgery is still set for 9
March, unless it needs to be done sooner in light of the blockage (Dr. Beavis noted that
things are rarely straightforward with my case...).So it's really day by day at this point.
No eating or drinking for now, and the tube will stay in my nose into my stomach.
Tomorrow they'll do a test w/contrast dye to see how things are passing through my
system.
A few bright spots through the gloom: chatting w/Dr. Beavis, 90% about my treatment
plan but 10% about other stuff, including how she met her husband, her recent biking
vacation in Colombia etc. She's a rock star in every way. Then a visit from Rhonda, the
wonderful chaplain (Methodist, but quite ecumenical) who I met after my first operation.
I also just love talking with her (and hearing her southern accent) and while we didn't
have time to pray today (as a phone call interrupted that), she will come visit me
tomorrow for some prayers of healing. Finally, my beautiful son and I chatted for a while
by phone; he'll kindly come from DC at some point this weekend to visit. As we
understand that my upcoming bday (4 March) *may* be spent in decidedly unfestive
conditions, Ben consented to this year 'share' his birthday, exactly one month after mine
on 4 April, with me! And it's truly a ""birth day"" for both of us.

Despite a three-day headache that I can't seem to shake, I wanted to write a brief
update. This morning began with the possibility that I might have to have my big surgery
*today:* Dr. Fang was afraid that the situation with the blockage might be degrading and
was also concerned about my own stamina waning having now been three days NPO
(nothing through the mouth, and with an NG tube still draining my stomach). However,
she said the upper GI test would determine the next steps. At that point, I texted my
brother the news and he and my mother were kind enough to get on the next train from
NY, arriving here around 2:00 p.m.
I had the upper GI test at 10:00 a.m.; it involved running a barium contrast dye through
my NG tube and then taking pictures at half-hour intervals to assess the progression of
the liquid through my digestive system. I couldn't hold the barium down at first, so we
had to start over. To my surprise, the test went more quickly than I expected (I was told
to bring a book as I might be there for several hours) and the radiologist then came to
tell me that the liquid had progressed quickly to the colon and that in fact the
obstruction seemed to be resolving!
So back to my room. Dr. Fang came by again to confirm this news and put forth a
revised plan. I will likely be here through Sunday or Monday, giving the obstruction
further time to resolve (although things can always change). Hopefully, the NG tube will
be removed tomorrow and I can begin receiving non-IV nourishment very slowly
(probably just a few sips of water at first). In order to be discharged, I will need to be
meeting certain benchmarks, which I already seem to be doing. If all advances as
planned, I'll be able to return to State College and regain some strength next week
before coming back to Baltimore next Sunday the 8th for the big fistula repair surgery on
the 9th.
I'm feeling pretty weak and, as mentioned, have had a non-stop headache, some
nausea, fatigue etc. but my abdomen feels less painful, which is a good thing. I continue
to have nothing but the highest praise for the doctors, nurses, technicians etc. at
Hopkins. Today I was cared for by a very sweet nurse named Kiki, who declared me
(based on my telling her that I teach French and her seeing a pretty amethyst and topaz
ring on my finger) ""the cutsiest, classiest, boutique-y lady."" I'll take it, especially as that's
hardly how I I feel today :) Then there was ""Mr. G"" (""Hi, Mr. G!,"" as the nurses greet him),
a dignified looking older gentleman who came to collect the trash in my room, which he
looks like he may have been doing since the Nixon (?) presidency. Many cheers for the
good, decent, dignified working people of Baltimore. 
It was comforting to have my mother and brother here. Ethan has to return to NY
tomorrow but my mother will stay on, and Ben will come from DC after a certification
test he has to take for work, perhaps spending the night if he can.

I am so very grateful for everyone's texts, emails, comments on CB. I did not have the
stamina today to respond to individual messages, but I'll try to get to them when I'm
feeling up to it.

103,"Foods I am craving right now: mole, Szechuan noodles, spaghetti and meatballs with a
ton of grated cheese, bananas Foster bread pudding from Magnolia Bakery in New York.
Maybe a cheeseburger and French fries. And a NY bagel with veggie cream cheese. In no
particular order. Or maybe all at once.
Foods I have eaten today (60 mls per hour): veggie broth, red jello, mango and cherry
ices, cranberry juice. 
After going on four days without eating and with a little imagination, the latter foods
tasted almost as good as the former! Almost.
I am coming along well. The residents doing rounds this morning examined me and said
my stomach felt much softer, which is a good sign. The female resident told me her
daughter's name is Zahava! In the late morning they did a study (I forgot what it's
called) to see how well liquids were flowing through my digestive system; it involved no
longer relying on suction. The study was to last for four hours. However, at about the two
hour mark while I was changing into a fresh gown, I sneezed forcefully several times and
wound up *sneezing out* my NG tube, the one going through my nose into my stomach!
We were all very surprised and couldn't figure out where the tube had gone. Thankfully, I
was spared the agony of having the tube reinserted as it was clear that the study was
going well, ie there was very little gastric discharge in the canister. So the study was
stopped and at that point I was put on clear liquids in small doses. This has had the
advantage of making my blazing headache abate and giving me a bit more energy (my
mother and I walked all around the three floors of this pavilion today as my walking is in
no way inhibited and I normally have plenty of energy for walking long distances).
The resident and I discussed the timetable for my discharge. Presuming I continue to
progress, I may be released either tomorrow afternoon/evening or Monday morning,
when I must get to two pre-op appointments for the surgery on the 9th. So fingers
crossed that I can return to State College on Monday, and enjoy a few days of normalcy
at work and with friends, and hopefully a pleasant birthday, before returning to
Baltimore next Sunday.
My brother had to return to NY but it was wonderful to have my mother and Ben here.
They went off to dinner (and tempted me with pictures of what they ate), but will be
back in the morning before Ben has to return to DC.

I am already impatient for my upcoming surgery to be over and done with so I can get on
with my life, although I know that I'm in for a longish recuperation. Ugh. But I'm already
setting some goals for myself. One will be to participate in a 5K/1 mile ""Stride and
Thrive"" run/walk to raise $$ for gynecological cancer research/awareness at Johns
Hopkins on 7 June. Ben and I were getting excited about putting a team together. Let us
know if you'd like to join us. A second will be to get to Paris at some point over the
summer. And the third will be to make it to a close friend's wedding in July. #goals.
A very sweet nurse, Kaitlynn, just came in to tell me that I've been 'advanced' to
*unlimited* clear liquids - woohoo! To celebrate, she is bringing me another mango ice,
of which I'll probably eat half, having promised not to 'chug' any of my liquids!",4,neutral,0.7066697,0.009571609,0.019263277,0.0076555735,0.20469114,0.7066697,0.010472928,0.04167573

Things have continued to trend in a very good direction today. I slept relatively well, ie in
three solid 'chunks' of 2-3 hours each, interrupted by technicians coming to my room to
take vitals. My obstruction has continued to resolve, allowing me to 'graduate' to a full
liquid diet at lunch (cream of tomato soup, chocolate ice cream) and a full low-fiber diet
for dinner (cheese omelet, mashed potatoes). My very dear son returned to spend a bit
more time with me this morning; we walked around the hospital, very quiet today. The
sky looked the color of early spring and I felt sad not to be out in it. But I see mild
temperatures predicted for this week.
And I am going home tomorrow! I will be discharged in the early morning after the
doctors round and examine me, then get ready to go to two pre-op appointments in
another part of the hospital, then have some lunch and head back to State College,
hopefully to arrive by the end of the afternoon. My mother will kindly stay with me until I
take off, before catching her train back to New York. A number of friends are very
generously retrieving my car at the hospital, bringing me some homemade beef broth
and a few groceries.
The night (or rather early morning, c. 3:30 a.m.) I arrived at Hopkins as well as last night,
I had the sweetest nurse, Kaitlynn. The nurses here are all wonderful and highly skilled.
Kaitlynn, all of twenty-four years old and who addressed me as ""sweetie"" and ""hon"" (this
last one a Baltimore thing, I think) left me the loveliest note on my white board this
morning (see pic). I hope she'll get to take care of me during my next stay here.
I hope my recent spate of written 'logorrhea' has not been off-putting, too 'TMI.'
Somehow, the words just keep tumbling out. This has had unexpectedly fortuitous
consequences for my academic writing: last week when I was working on a scholarly
article the writing came much more easily and fluidly than it normally does. The Caring
Bridge writing seems to me both a way of helping me articulate my emotions and at the
same time of keeping them in check, giving cogent shape to a flood of feeling that might
'come out' other ways if not channeled here. And as long as I keep writing, keep typing,
I'm not breaking down too much, although rereading does on occasion bring tears to my
eyes (a sign that I've been as authentic as I can, I suppose). Thanks very much to
anyone who cares to read, and please don't feel obligated to keep up!

                       374 / 1.901
I am overjoyed to be home. The day began early (the doctors rounded at 6:15), with a
few snafus, but fortunately nothing health-related nor serious. I spent about an hour
looking for my shoes, having convinced myself both that I had left them in the
emergency room in State College and that I'd have to return home shoeless, wearing
only hospital socks. A random last-minute look under the bed uncovered my shoes. More
aggravatingly, around 8:15 I was wheeled about 15 minutes across the hospital to my
pre-op appointments, only to discover that I couldn't have the appointments without
having first been discharged. So all the way back across the hospital, only to find out
that, in the end, a)the ostomy nurse who was supposed to 'mark' me is out of the office
this week (!) and b)the anesthesiologists, having reviewed my EKG and other results,
determined that they didn't need to see me. Ouf. I suppose this means that I might have
been discharged last night... So I went to the pharmacy to pick up all the stuff required
for the prep I need to do Sunday for Monday's operation, then stopped at the cafeteria to
pick up some lunch (which thankfully sat well with me), then back up to the room to get
my bag and hug the very friendly, upbeat and savvy nurse, Rachel, who had helped take
care of me during my stay. My mother was kind enough to stay with me until the very
end, when we parted ways at the hospital entrance -- she Ubering to the station to get
her train back to NY and me waiting for the car service that takes me back and forth
when I don't have my own car with me and/or can't drive. I was so happy to take in big
gulps of fresh air in what felt like very early spring weather while awaiting my ride.
Wanted to add here that I'm feeling so much better than when I went to the emergency
room early last week. My abdomen is much less bloated, I'm having much less
discomfort and nausea. The Hopkins team knew what to do - some of it involved
basically starving me for four days. :)
The driver, Mohindr (who is my buddy now) and who is quite solicitous (he's praying for
me) and responsible (transporting me in a comfy, roomy, clean SUV), had brought along
his wife, Kashmir, to keep him company. They look to be in their 50s (?) and are very
sweet. He operates out of the Virginia suburbs and apparently drives several politicians,
prominent clergy at the National Cathedral etc. Kashmir gave me some tips for making
Indian rice pudding (like using a slow cooker, and throwing in a cinnamon stick). I
convinced them to make a detour for me so we could stop at Alvaro's, the phenomenal
old-style Italian bakery in Harrisburg that is usually my pit stop when I travel between SC
and DC or Baltimore. I bought two pounds of yummy Italian cookies for the bday potluck
lunch we are having at work on Wednesday. Mohindr and Kashmir bought cookies too,
and Italian bread. They took a picture of me with my 'stash' (see pic), which also
included a small portion of tiramisu gelato for me (so good...). Then Mohindr insisted we
take some selfies, apparently happy that I had proposed making the trip into a bit of an
adventure. It's been a wild and crazy ride all along, let me tell 'ya.
                       375 / 1.901
I forgot to mention that, while en route back to State College, Dr. Beavis called me.
Mohindr was nice enough to pull over to reduce traffic noise, but it meant that we were
sort of precariously camped out on a narrow highway shoulder. Dr. Beavis was very
touched and grateful that, thanks to the generosity of my friends (meaning here: the
ones on Facebook), I was able to direct a significant amount of $$ towards ovarian
cancer research/awareness programs at Hopkins, in Dr. Beavis' honor, timed as a
fundraiser on the occasion of my upcoming birthday (btw: if anyone else is interested in
donating, you can do so here: https://secure.jhu.edu/form/obgyn.
You might donate in Dr. Beavis' honor to the Susan Burgert Survivorship Program, which
is on the drop down menu). In any event, Dr. Beavis had come to see me in my room
today, but I had already left. We talked a bit more about the upcoming surgery. To
prepare myself psychologically, I tried to get more of a sense of how 'big' it will be in
comparison to my debulking surgery last May. As I knew, this is major abdominal
surgery. If I do have to have an ostomy, temporarily or permanently, that will be a new
element to adjust to and thus a new part of my recovery. But she stressed again that I'm
in better health than last May. Of course, if they uncover new cancer a new plan will
need to be put in place. She thought my hospital stay might be 5-7 days, which would be
*way* more manageable than the three-week stay last time, due to complications
(abdominal infection) that were already starting to develop then and that have
necessitated surgery now. I told her how strongly (underscore that many times)
motivated I am to recover asap in order to get on with my life. 
I look forward to enjoying every minute of the next five days here and to trying not to
think too much about the next hurdle. Many thanks to my friends Maria for having some
groceries waiting on my return, to Monique, for bringing copious amounts of one of her
delicious, restorative broths and to Deb and Tony for retrieving my car at the hospital
(and the beautiful springlike flowers) -- and needless to say to my mother, Sharon,
brother Ethan and Ben for being by my side in the hospital. So so grateful for all the
texts, emails, FB messages of support, love and good cheer from friends and family old
and new. Thanks for travelling this road with me.

I had a wonderful birthday. I always have trouble sleeping the night before, out of
excitement. I've always been a 'birthday girl.'
Over breakfast I opened a number of cards and gifts that had been accumulating the
past few days, all of which made me smile with happiness and gratitude. I also started
checking Facebook (where the first bday greetings were coming in from France, six
hours ahead), as well as my texts, emails etc. While I have an ambivalent relationship
with social media, I love how on birthdays all these means of communication help
produce a splendid chorus of good cheer.
I got dressed to the 1978 song by one-hit wonder Patrick Hernandez, ""Born to be Alive,""
who anyone who lived through the disco era with me should remember. The pulsating,
slightly manic mood of that song somehow seemed right for the day. I blared the music
and sung the lyrics at the top of my lungs: ""It's good to be alive...be alive...be alive. It's
good to be aliiiivvvve!""
Then I set off for J. Stephens Salon, where my long time hair stylist, Sarah, colored my
*very short* hair (I have not had hair this short since I was an infant), which Chelsey then
cut for me. I had been anticipating this visit as a kind of 'watershed moment,' when I
would ditch my wig and begin 'living my truth' (except for the illusion of my hair still
being dark brown!). While I was initially unsure how I felt about the look, which is
dramatically different for me, I believe I am growing into it, even embracing it, even
rocking it! The response from friends and family has been positive and affirming, with
comparisons to French theorist/intellectual Hélène Cixious, singer Anne Lennox, and the
composer Laurie Anderson. My look has been variously described as 'cool,' 'edgy,' 'chic'
and 'sophisticated.' I like that my earrings now become a prominent accessory, dangling
from my super-visible ears, and that a bit of extra makeup adds to the dramatic overall
effect. Needless to say, all of this will go down the drain if I have to have more chemo
but until that happens (if it does) I am enjoying my new 'do.'
Next I headed to school for a potluck bday lunch. As several of my colleagues and I have
taken to lunching together informally 2-3 times a week, we decided to do something
slightly more ambitious yesterday. About eight of us (including two of my former
colleagues, now retired, who nicely showed up) gathered to enjoy a salmon quiche,
sushi, a pissaladière (a classic dish of Provence featuring caramelized onions, anchovies
and olives), salad and more. I brought Italian cookies from Alvaro's in Harrisburg, a cake
and chocolates. Every time a new person walked into the seminar room (where we had
lunch), everyone recommenced singing ""Happy Birthday"" to me in English or French. It
felt like Groundhog Day -hilarious. I probably went slightly off the rails in terms of my
food consumption - I avoided items like nuts that I knew would not sit well given my
recent abdominal troubles, but it was hard to resist having seconds of some of the other
                       379 / 1.901
treats (the cookies were my downfall).
Then it was time to get ready for a departmental faculty meeting and to take care of
some other work tasks. 
After work I gathered about ten friends for drinks and snacks at Barrel 21, a local
distillery. My Hopkins doctors had authorized one cocktail (I have not been drinking
because of a very potent antibiotic prescribed to me, but I was able to stop taking it a
few days ago). I treated myself to a stiff Manhattan with the good Bourbon B21 distills,
and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also had a burger, hold the bacon. It was a very merry
gathering of friends in different departments/units (French, Spanish, Italian, English,
German, Music and the Penn State Press). The group reprised the by now absurd
repeated singings of ""Happy Birthday."" So much fun.
An avalanche of FB messages, texts, emails, cards, phone calls, gifts and donations to
Hopkins left me feeling overwhelmed by the end of the day, overwhelmed by kindness.
My mother's card features a series of bright drawings of the sun, accompanied by the
message ""There's a light inside you and every year it just gets brighter"" - thank you,
mom. :) In a humorous vein, my friend Shanny sent a card featuring a drawing of a
beautiful princess or noblewoman looking radiant and enraptured in a bright yellow gown
as she seems to 'glide' in front of a medieval castle while a lord and lady look on, with
the caption ""The anti-depressants seem to be working."" Yesss.... Everyone who reached
out to me showed such thoughtfulness in their words and deeds... I am one lucky girl.
My birthday was a real 'high.' In fact, I've felt a bit 'heightened' since I've been back from
the hospital, especially knowing what's on the horizon early next week. Hoping that an
equally forceful 'crash' does not ensue... But between now and Sunday, living well will be
my best revenge...
PS: I hope to personally thank many of you in writing, but it may take me just a little
while.

107,"I left home around 8:30 on this beautiful, sunny, springlike morning and was in Baltimore
before noon; I drove myself this time. I was going to leave later but last night I realized --
guess I hadn't read the fine print-- that I had to start my bowel prep by noon, and for that
I needed to be well installed near a bathroom. So I had to make a supermarket run at
about 7:30 last night to pick up some jello, chicken bouillon, and Gatorade to ingest
today as part of my clear liquid diet. Ugh.
I slept pretty well last night, although with the 'spring forward' it was still dark when I
awoke at 7:00. The previous two or three nights, though, had been plagued by insomnia,
as I started to feel very anxious about tomorrow's surgery. An avalanche of 'what ifs'
swirled through my mind: what if Dr. Beavis finds more cancer? and what if that means
I've reached a more advanced stage (ie IV instead of III)? what if I experience
tremendous pain in my abdomen/diaphragm, as I did last time? what if I wake up with an
ostomy pouch? what if there are complications during surgery? what is my body has
trouble handling the rigors of this surgery? what if it takes me a really long time to
recuperate? Staying busy at work this past week kept some of these anxieties at bay,
but they reemerged at night.
The pre-op prep is going more smoothly than last May, when I was so sick and anxious I
couldn't keep anything down and we all (my mother, Ethan and Ben) had a frightful
night. This time, I'm in a nicer, more comfortable hotel (the hotel in May was in a sketchy
                       382 / 1.901
neighborhood, adding to the stress), Ben is in DC until tomorrow (I told him that there
was no reason for him to come today, as my mother and Ethan are here), and I rested a
bit each hour after taking whatever was prescribed for that time (Miralax mixture, or
antibiotics, or laxative pills, or additional fluids etc.). If you've done this before, you know
it is not at all pleasant, but at least I'm feeling comfortable and as relaxed as I can be. I
have to wake up at about 4:30 to get the hospital at 5:30 (surgery's at 7:30) but I might
chill out until 10 by watching my guilty pleasure, ""90 Day Fiance."" Gotta have my junk
t.v.
It was lovely to enjoy two final 'normal' outings this weekend before my surgery
tomorrow. My friend Helen and I gabbed for a few hours over dinner Friday night at Gigi's
- much fun. Yesterday, my friend Clare and I drove to Tait Farm where a demo about
creating cute little teacup 'gardens' for succulent plants was taking place. We did some
shopping there, said 'woof' to the adorable Basset hounds they breed there, then went to
have tea at the Pump Station Cafe in Boalsburg. If felt so good to sit outside, sunning our
faces and chatting. My fervent wish is to return to all of this asap. It's the little things...
But for now I'll be slipping into the arms of Morpheus and entrusting Drs. Fang and
Beavis with my body (and life...) as they work to heal me. If this surgery resolves the
host of abdominal issues that have been pestering me since last May, and if I can back
on track before long, it will have been worth it.
As always, thanks so much for recent texts and emails (I still haven't responded to all the
birthday messages I received!). I'm too worn out to respond to them now, but hopefully
I'll be able to from the hospital as I recuperate. I've given my brother 'co-authorship'
rights to my Caring Bridge. I expect he'll provide an update once I'm out of surgery.

than I allowed myself to hope.” Willa has just been brought to recovery (not ICU), after
the dream team of Dr’s Beavis, Fang & Han spent the past 5-6 hours in the OR. The
fistula and abscesses/inflammation have been removed, scar tissue was loosened and
there was no visible cancer. And, while there was some additional removal of parts of the
small/large intestine and colon, in a resection, she’ll be heading back to SC without an

in Baltimore, I ponder for a moment about the last 10 months. Reflecting quietly, as I sit
on the train back to NYC, the mood doesn’t feel as frantic and urgent as May 2019. The
reason - she’s making great progress towards fighting this disease and reclaiming her
fulfilling life. Willa has once again shown tremendous grit, as she recuperates from
another major abdominal surgery. While it was not the M.O.A.S. of ‘19, it was
nonetheless excruciatingly painful and taxing. She has begun to strive for and achieve
necessary benchmarks towards her recovery and discharge. Just this morning, we took a
walk down the corrider of Marburg 2, her third such stroll in 2 days. These walks, and the
all day prodding are exhausting. She thanks you all for the outpouring of notes, texts,
and hearts, and will surely be back in touch with you once she is at full strength. She is
being very well cared for, and we cannot thank the team at Johns Hopkins enough for
their unwavering love, support and expertise.

continued to hit several necessary benchmarks. Several others still must be achieved
before ultimately being able to head home to State College -- hopefully within several
days, though no specific date has yet been proposed by her medical team. Willa's pain
has decreased (from an ""8"" on Tuesday, a ""7"" yesterday, to a ""5"" today), and spirits are
up. We took a total of seven laps around the hospital floor this morning and afternoon --
at times, I was struggling to keep up with her!

Appreciative thanks again to my brother, Ethan, and son, Ben, for posting for me the
past few days as I didn't feel up to it. Today I seem to. I made a big step with my
recovery today. After two 'clamp tests' to assess how much 'stuff' was still coming out of
my stomach, it was determined that my NG tube could be removed! It had been running
through my nose into my stomach for five days, and was really starting to irritate my
throat, nose, stomach etc. As a result, I orally ingested my first food (30 ml of mango ice
at one-hour intervals) in the past *six* days. Another bit of good news is that the tape
covering my incision was removed as it continues to heal. It's the same incision that was
used in May (a zipper might have been easier at this point....). I still have quite a bit of
abdominal pain, although it's certainly less than after last May's surgery. That will take
time to heal. However, I am coping with minimal pain meds at this point, whereas I spent
the first few days in a dialudid haze. Aside from one or two student nurses who definitely
need more training (they will get it here), my care has continued to be superb, with Drs.
Fang and Beavis as well as other doctors (eg pain team) closely monitoring my
treatment.
I don't remember if my brother or Ben shared additional good news (my mind is still
slightly foggy). The surgery went better than Dr. Beavis expected, in part because a)no
ostomy was needed (I had been anxious about this) and b)no significant cancer was
found. Dr. Beavis saw a few 'specks' that she sent to pathology to be biopsied. But she's
not even sure they are cancerous. If they are, her plan is to put me on the parp inhibitors
I was debating taking a month of so ago instead of suggesting additional chemo. So
thank goodness no more chemo for the time being. In the end, the surgeons 'took down'
the whole area surrounding the fistula, including the fistula itself, abscess and an
additional portion of my colon and small intestine. But I will recover and will be able to
manage with this reconfigured digestive system. 
Of course, as I deal with my own physical disequilibrium, the entire world has lost its
equilibrium in ways that are terribly unsettling, scary, and troubling, rife with
uncertainty. The verse from Hamlet came quickly to me: ""The time is out of joint..."" A
friend described this moment as 'dystopian,' which also rings true. I am so very sorry for
our students who had to return from their study abroad experiences (or will not be
permitted to undertake them this summer), for our seniors who will not be feted at our
lovely end of the year awards ceremony (and perhaps not even at graduation; U of
Michigan just cancelled theirs), for my colleagues who will be doing the heavy lifting as
Penn State puts all its classes on line for the next several weeks. We're in uncharted
territory here...
It is always chilling, when I teach the medieval plague in my culture courses, to read
contemporary accounts of how the social fabric was rent by ""social distancing:"" once a
home was affected by the plague, children no longer visited dying parents, husbands
                       393 / 1.901
could no longer tend to sick wives, babies died alone... The plague was the great social
equalizer. Let's hope that friendship, love, relationships, conversations and all that
makes life a gift can continue - maybe even strengthen during this seemingly calamitous
time.
I truly wish I could do more to help. But in the near future I must be very careful to
protect my immune system and limit my contacts, certainly avoiding large groups.
Fortunately (I guess), since Ben is teleworking all next week, he can drive me back to
State College -- I'll likely be discharged Monday or Tuesday -- and stay at home for the
week, helping run errands for me, take me to a doctor's appointment etc. He's been
nothing but a kind, patient, compassionate and helpful mensch during these last two
successive hospital stays and I am so lucky to have such a son. It's still very hard for him
to watch me go through this, but by now we sort of 'know the drill' on some level, and we
know that we're getting through it together along with the rest of our very solid, loving
support system. We sat outside today in the sun on a balcony overlooking the historic,
original buildings of the Hopkins Medical Center, while he enjoyed a lunch of delicious-
smelling Jamaican jerk chicken (I got to smell it). We even had some great belly laughs
(which hurt my belly!). My mother and brother have also been loving and invaluable
caregivers. I am so grateful.
Finally, I received some welcome spiritual sustenance today, as my rabbi from State
College called me and assured me that I'm in his prayers daily. Yesterday my dear first
cousin David and wife Ilene visited (they live in Baltimore) and brought good cheer and
assurances that they were davening and sending mi shebeirachs my way. Finally, the
wonderful Methodist (yet ecumenical) chaplain here, Rhonda, came to chat and provided
a blessing of healing. I suggested that she send the blessing out not just to me and my
family and the caregivers at Hopkins but to the entire world, which needs it now. Tonight
is shabbat, a shabbat of the soul, maybe time for the entire world to detach, turn
inwards, enjoy loved ones' company, and send love out around the globe.

screening visitors. I can only receive one visitor at a time. I've been told that they're
short staffed because any health worker who has even a slight cold or feels
'compromised' in any way is staying home. It certainly seems quiet here today, even
though the floor is full with patients. I have only the highest admiration for the health
workers I've encountered here (and all others), who are now on the front lines, patiently
taking blood and vital signs, administering meds and procedures. Based on my convos
with them, they understand fully the risks of the current situation -- to them and
everyone. I was told that a Hopkins doctor has been affected by the virus but don't have
confirmation.
I'm coming along well. Ate solid food for the first time since my operation today and it
sat well, although my newly reconfigured digestive system is quirky. I think I've met all
the benchmarks, but now the docs have to stabilize my electrolyte levels, which were
low today. I'm really hoping that this won't impede my being discharged early this week,
but it's for my surgeon to decide tomorrow.
One of the worst things about these hospital stays, and about needing treatment for a
disease, is the pain. I've been in agony a few times since arriving here, including when a
potassium/magnesium infusion began corroding one of my veins, sending shooting pain
through my arm and hand. My abdomen still hurts a lot, especially when I stand up
straight. This pain will abate in time. I've been walking about eight laps around the
hospital floor each day and look forward to continuing my walking when I'm home.
On some level, though, I feel like my problems ""don't amount to a hill of beans, in this
crazy world"" (a line that came to me forcefully today). I would like to be on the 'helping'
side and not on the one needing help. I have been thinking about some ways I can do
this and am nurturing an idea or two... At the same time, I am very fortunate to belong
to a caring community. My synagogue sent out a note saying that weekly Friday night
services would not be cancelled (a six feet separation between congregants will be
respected) and also reaching out to anyone in need at this time. No sooner had I written
to the congregant coordinating this effort than she wrote me back to assure me that she
                       397 / 1.901
would be happy to shop for me.  Another friend has offered the same, and my house
cleaner is keeping my home ultra-clean and disinfected. So I consider myself quite
fortunate, and will be able to focus on my continued recovery and start working at home
before long. 
I have no words to describe my revulsion at the way our 'leader' has been handling the
crisis. He is in fact the opposite of a leader. How a Lincoln, a Roosevelt, a Churchill, an
Obama would have provided solace, wisdom, sound policies, and hope at this time, and
how they would have led by example. So tragic for our country.
I ordered a 2000 piece puzzle of Cinque Terre for Ben and I to attack this week and I also
plan to introduce him to _Casablanca_ (hence the reference above!).
Stay safe and healthy, everyone, and let's stay connected. Sending big e-hugs and lots
of love,

113,"Just a quick note to let everyone know that I am home from the hospital. Feels so good.
Dr. Fang came to examine and speak with me this morning. She thinks I'm making good
progress and can continue my recovery at home. At the same time, she suggested that
the hospital is going to need more beds very soon... Tents are being set up outside to
accommodate the overflow. I really feel like I've fled a rapidly-advancing tsunami here --
a very strange feeling indeed. The Hopkins personnel all understand that, as Dr. Fang
said to me this morning, ""as doctors [and health professionals], we're obligated to treat
everyone."" Yet the atmosphere in the hospital seemed tense.
I returned with some meds -- pain medication, a blood thinner (that I have to inject into
myself, not my favorite activity...), and some fiber powder to take 3X day. 
Wonderful Ben was on hand to pick me up in my car and drive me home, on a fairly
sunny early springlike day, across this strange new landscape (supermarket parking lots
were full, restaurant parking lots empty). A kind friend, Esther, dropped off some
groceries to tide us over for the first day or so. And an acquaintance had left a bag of NY
bagels.
Ben will stay here this week and telework -- an enormous help and comfort to me.
Although I have significant surgical abdominal pain (no driving for a month...), I overall
feel *much* better than when I returned from my surgery in May, when I could barely get
up from a chair and felt exhausted and overwhelmed. While friends will kindly help with
groceries and perhaps some meals they'll prepare at home, I also feel well enough (and
actually look forward to) doing some simple cooking.
The most important thing is for everyone to stay well and safe right now. Thank you for
all your messages, hearts, emails and texts while I was at Hopkins. Feeling connected to
my friends and family is important to me, especially  now.",6,surprise,0.5939767,0.0065070847,0.006082539,0.29502815,0.008338848,0.035713516,0.054353163,0.5939767
114,"Just a quick posting to share some good news: at Dr. Patel's office yesterday (I was
nervous to even keep the appointment for fear of contagion, but he couldn't offer me
another one until August so...), he had just received from Hopkins the biopsy report for
my operation last Monday; Dr. Beavis had had three 'specks' biopsied at the time. Very
happily, those specks tested negative for cancer. So no IV chemo in the near future
although, as mentioned, we may -- or may not -- try PARP inhibitors (a type of
maintenance chemo) in the interest of delaying a recurrence.
Normally, this kind of good news would have me determined to grab life by the horns
and ride it hard, ie by travelling, gathering with friends, dining out etc. Normally after
                       401 / 1.901
such news, my doctors advise me to do exactly that. I would get on the phone right now
and buy a plane ticket to attend my friend Elisabeth's daughter's wedding in Burgundy in
May. Granted, I am still recuperating from surgery, but the ""honeymoon period"" I am
envisioning is simply not possible right now because of the coronavirus -- and of course I
understand that. So the universe is sending me contradictory messages at this time and
I need to think more on what it is trying to teach me. 
After seeing Dr. Patel, I had my port flushed in the chemo room. I feel fortunate not to be
undergoing chemo right now, which would leave my immune system suppressed. I really
feel for those tackling this (Dr. Fang told me that my immune system is actually quite
'ramped up' from surgery right now, although recent treatment for cancer does
constitute an'underlying condition'). Anyway, I asked the nurse how they've been faring
since the explosion of the virus and she replied: ""Fine, I think the media exaggerates the
threat of the virus anyway."" I very rarely feel myself becoming irate, but I could sense
my face becoming red and my pulse quickening. ""And what evidence is this idea based
on?"" I asked her. ""It's just my opinion, Willa. I don't want to cause a rift."" Before I
launched into: ""What reason would the media have for exaggerating this public health
threat?"" ""Do you think all media are exaggerating the seriousness of the virus or just
some?"" and ""Do you think Johns Hopkins Medicine is exaggerating the threat by setting
up tents outside the hospital and cordoning off an entire wing?,"" I managed to restrain
myself. It just seemed to me incredibly irresponsible -- and the word 'unpatriotic' also
came to mind - for a *health worker* to take a page from the FoxNews playbook. I even
thought about reporting the nurse to the office manager. But I did not and will not. It just
made me mad. Very mad. End of rant.
Ben and I watched _Casablanca_ last night. What a brilliant film and how it rings true in
the current climate. Refugees flood Casablanca, fleeing a 'moral' plague and willing to
take all risks to preserve their safety. When Rick has to sell off his cafe because of the
volatile situation, he insists that his employees, especially the popular piano-player,
Sam, be kept on payroll to ensure their livelihood. Everything from mundane concerns to
great loves seem overtaken by the sweep of history and politics in ""this crazy world.""
We'll always have Paris...
I continue to recover and Ben and I are hunkering down; he's working and I'm doing
some work, writing etc. It's peaceful here and we're fine. Maybe we'll watch _Raging
Bull_ tonight.  We'll go on a walk soon. Everyone take care, please.",2,fear,0.8385615,0.1376377,0.0015985159,0.8385615,0.0060588415,0.0072088977,0.003672295,0.0052621975
115,"404 / 1.901
The relentlessly upbeat, unflappable, and wonderful Dr. Anna Beavis (see pic) called me
this morning (gotta appreciate a doctor who will call on a Saturday morning) to follow up
from last week's surgery. She didn't know whether I knew - but I did, from Dr. Patel --
that my biopsy had come back negative for cancer. She declared this news ""amazing.""
And I am rejoicing in it too! Because of this, there will be no cancer treatment of any kind
(including with PARP inhibitors) for the foreseeable future. In any event, she said she
would discourage my taking the inhibitors at present because they'd suppress my
immune system, making me more susceptible to, for example, coronavirus (the irony of
having survived cancer to die from coronavirus has not been lost on me). So unless I
become symptomatic, I will now have a three-month *reprieve* before seeing Dr. Patel
for blood screening (to assess my CA125 number and other levels), with an appointment
with Dr. Beavis scheduled for three months after that. While I realize that 'remission' is a
conditional state and while fully understanding the sobering statistics for recurrences
with ovarian cancer, I am embracing this welcome news, which couldn't come at a more
opportune time.
We also discussed my upcoming (3/31) follow-up appointment with Dr. Fang. I had
already started to become nervous at the prospect of returning to Hopkins, where Dr.
Beavis tells me that they are treating at least ten confirmed cases of coronavirus. Since
many patients apparently share my unease (>lots of cancellations), we discussed the
possibility of a video appointment, during which Dr. Fang and I would talk about my
progress and she would (virtually) examine my incision. Dr. Beavis just needs to find out
about the legality (!) of this -- apparently, it becomes a bit complicated across state
lines. Insurance coverage could be tricky too. We agreed that we're in uncharted
territory here...
Meanwhile, I am coming along. Dr. Beavis had said to me: ""You may lose your spring, but
you'll have your summer and fall."" I'm cautiously optimistic that I may be running ahead
                       405 / 1.901
of that timetable. However, I still have surgical pain, get a bit winded after a walk around
the block, and need a lot of sleep and rest (hopefully not a reflection of low red blood cell
or magnesium/potassium levels). It's going to take me a while to get my stamina back,
and all the injunctions on Facebook to Zumba, cook, live stream operas, virtually visit
museums etc. make me feel even more strung out. Right now, I just need to be. I did
have enough energy yesterday, though, to make Indian rice pudding.
Thankfully, Ben is here and is a comforting, helpful, steady presence. As I write, he is
working on a 2000-piece puzzle of Cinque Terre that I bought for us to help bide the
time. I gave up after a while because I'm color blind and was tearing my hair out with all
the gradations of color. Ben is also color blind, although not as dramatically as I am. His
powers of concentration and (Aries) stubbornness are helping him stick with it. We drove
downtown, which was virtually deserted, but people are out, here and there, biking,
jogging, strolling, walking their dogs.
Ben asked if the coronavirus was totally unprecedented in modern times. I told him that,
for me at least, while 9/11 shook our nation to its core, and while we more or less all
'sheltered in place' on that day, only three areas of the country bore the awful physical
toll. AIDS was an epidemic with a frightful human cost, and we lost loved ones. Yet the
scope of the coronavirus is much broader, cutting across a broad swath of ages, genders,
sexual orientations, races, socioeconomic groups etc. As a New Yorker, I feel keenly the
kind of 'New York-centric' hit of all three of these plagues, even as I realize that
coronavirus is devastating many other areas of our country too. What I am
mourning/have mourned in all three crises is a type of insouciance, excitement, vibrancy
and romance I associate with my hometown (and ditto for Paris). New York has risen
from the ashes before. Will it again? What will anything or any of us be like on the other
side?",3,joy,0.88144964,0.0037045877,0.0020580746,0.04996289,0.88144964,0.040265452,0.01500911,0.0075503425
116,"I realize it's been a while since I've written. The days have seemed to blur into one
another recently, during this strange parenthesis in our normal lives.
My recovery continues to go well, thankfully. I can stand up straighter as the abdominal
surgical pain continues to abate incrementally. My incision has closed into a scar and
looks fine. My stomach remains a bit unsteady but Dr. Fang has just prescribed some
Imodium that I hope will help. I'm adhering strictly to a low-fiber diet, which agrees with
me. On April 9th Dr. Fang said I could start experimenting with some raw fruits and
veggies. I definitely feel fatigued and need to rest during the day, but Dr. Fang reminded
me that I had a major surgery and that 4-6 weeks of fatigue is perfectly normal. I'm
getting lots of extra sleep.
                       408 / 1.901
Dr. Fang called me today to let me know that we can't meet virtually next Tuesday
because I'm a 'Pennsylvanian.' Since she is licensed only in Maryland, apparently video-
meetings with out of state patients are illegal (I am not sure why this is the case, as in-
person meetings with out of state patients of course happen all the time at the hospital).
However, we again agreed that an in-person meeting at Hopkins is not desirable for me
at this time, as the hospital is treating coronavirus cases. So we pretty much had our
appointment by phone (somehow, this is allowed...). I will also send her an image of my
incision. And I'll follow up with any further questions by email. I'm obsessively focused on
staying out of the hospital for any reason.
I feel very fortunate that I am not actively in treatment for cancer right now. The fact in
itself is reason to be thankful, but (even the prospect of) confronting that 'double
whammy' of cancer and coronavirus makes me fearful. My immune system would be ill-
equipped to handle it. Given the harrowing stories I'm reading in the _New York Times_
about packed to the gills hospital emergency rooms in the city, would I lose out if/when it
came to triaging patients, due to my doubly compromised condition? On the brighter (!)
side, because of last May's operation and my recent treatment I 'know the drill' in terms
of having to hunker down at home. It's not that dramatic an adjustment, although I do
wonder about the psychic toll on all of us of so much isolation... When this is all over, I
will want to give everyone I know the *biggest* hug!
I am so glad Ben is here. He has taken over my office (while I work at the dining table,
next to a big window) and seems busy with work. He has an upcoming decision to make
about grad school for next year, but as with everything else coronavirus has thrown a
wrench into admissions timetables, campus visits etc. We've watched a few classic
movies - _Casablanca,_ _Raging Bull_ - and a good new documentary, _Crip Camp_
(about the early disability rights movement). We take daily walks. And the puzzle is
coming along, but I'm afraid I sort of gave up on it. A number of friends have been kind
enough to bring meals and grocery shop for me, and Ben has been very helpful around
the house. My support network has shrunk a bit since the virus hit, but I completely
understand people wanting to be as risk-averse as possible.
 
As the one-year anniversary of my diagnosis approaches, and as I didn't begin writing
this journal until I had returned from the hospital in June (I believe), I will probably try to
reconstruct the timeline of events, mainly last April, that led to my surgery on 9 May. I
am not quite sure why I feel compelled to do this, as it will undoubtedly force me to
relive a trauma. Perhaps I need some clarity. Or some closure. Or some perspective. Or
perhaps I have some morbid attachment to this 'series of unfortunate events.' I'm not
sure. But it feels important to do, somehow.
In the interest of a bit of levity, I include a photo of my brother and me at the 1964 (!)
Worlds Fair in Flushing Meadow, NY. (Thank you, Ethan, for the tremendous and
generous job you've done in preserving our family archives, including some stills from
                       409 / 1.901
our films). I have some vivid memories of that Fair, including the attraction at which ""It's
a small world after all"" was played (I think I was with my grandmother). I wish I knew
what I was staring at (or reading??) so intently in that photo (I was all of five years old,
my brother likely two), but our poses seem characteristic.",2,fear,0.95953333,0.0013318666,0.0012036051,0.95953333,0.0019475545,0.013591679,0.017367838,0.0050240774
117,"We continue to live in a state of suspended animation, the days blurring into one
another. Even my outfit rarely changes, although some days I'll put on some makeup.
The news is grim - there are hardly words to describe the situation. Close to 10.000.000
unemployment claims! And an ocean of woe, fear, and uncertainty. Closer to home,
we've lost a cousin to COVID-19 -- our cousin Ruth Goldman in Toronto -- as her husband,
my mother's first cousin Gene, is now also hospitalized and in dire condition. Others we
know have overcome milder cases. And if April's tolls are as severe as predicted, we'll
surely all soon know someone affected. 
Here in Happy Valley we are relatively safe, although our local hospital just reported
admitting its first case of a patient with the virus. I am continuing to recover well from
my surgery, although I still have surgical abdominal pain and my digestive system
definitely has a mind (or nervous system) of its own most of the time. I've been
monitoring my diet very carefully (on 9 April I can start adding some raw fruits and
veggies to the mix) and have been allowing myself to sleep as much as I need. I was
able to forego my appointment at Hopkins last week, opting instead for a phone meeting
with Dr. Fang, to whom I also sent photos of my incision. To these she replied:""Looks
beautiful! You are healing extremely well!"" and ""You have done fabulously after
surgery."" Of course, this was heartening to hear. However, I know that the sword of
Damocles is always hanging over me in terms of a possible (likely?) recurrence. Today I
started to let my mind wander to the small fluid pocket in my lower lung that Dr. Beavis
has been monitoring, until I realized that I was about five minutes away from a freak out.

Luckily, I was able to rein myself in and return to living in the moment.
Meanwhile, Ben continues to work full days while I continue to work slightly shorter ones,
punctuated by Zoom meetings with colleagues. I am anxious about the effects of the
crisis on higher education, one of x number of institutions that will undoubtedly be
adversely affected. In good news, Ben will stay at least two more weeks! He is going to
DC tomorrow to bring back his girlfriend, Sammi, who will stay with Ben's dad (Michael)
and stepmother (Sue). We have put in place many precautions to safeguard my health
(and everyone else's). Decisions large and small seem so fraught these days... Kind
friends and neighbors have been bringing meals every other day while Ben and I cook
simple dishes on the intervening days (I hope to concoct something a bit more ambitious
for Ben's 25th birthday on Saturday). We are well fed and housed and have everything
we need. We take walks in the lovely early spring weather. I consider myself extremely
lucky.",2,fear,0.6106678,0.0046755834,0.0058302777,0.6106678,0.0042648106,0.030684052,0.33706212,0.006815397
118,"As best as I can remember, it was last April that I started feeling 'symptomatic.' Granted,
I had begun to feel slightly bloated as early as January (?), but rationalized it this way: a)I
sit on my ass in front of a computer all day and have become lazy about exercise; b)as a
result of a)I have gained weight. No wonder my stomach appears a bit distended when I
look at myself from the side in the mirror, but when I suck in my stomach the bulge goes
away - so voilà, it can't be cancer.
Besides, I was simply too busy to have cancer. As a first-year department head, I was
working ten hour days. (This, incidentally, became another rationalization: I work ten-
hour days, have a hearty appetite, and sleep well for the most part; ergo, I can't possibly
                       413 / 1.901
have cancer). I was also firmly intent on bringing to fruition my week-long Holocaust-
focused trip to Paris over spring break, with eighteen students in tow, which I had been
planning for a year. The trip is immensely meaningful to me personally, and the students
invariably consider it 'transformative' too. So I downplayed the bloating, and we went to
Paris. The trip was extraordinary.
In fact (and my mind is a bit fuzzy here), I opted to cancel a January appointment to have
a sonogram. I believe this was recommended follow-up after a routine ob-gyn checkup I
had had a month prior. My dim memory is that I did not like the doctor or physician's
assistant I had for the first time at that appointment. I had to convince her to provide a
PAP smear (she didn't think it was necessary) and I can't remember if it was her or me
that requested the follow-up sonogram -- the one that I didn't wind up having until
March.
But by early April, as mentioned, I began to have tell-tale symptoms, and they continued
to worsen (as I'll describe in a future post). The abdominal bloating continued. When I
lifted something heavy (like my school bag), I felt a tugging or pulling in my abdominal
area. I also began to feel progressively more tired (rationalization: it's been a heck of a
busy school year, and it's almost at its end. No wonder you're exhausted). I would come
home from work/grocery shopping by 7:30/8:00, sink down into my couch, inert, and
think to myself: ""Shit, I feel *really* exhausted.""
Writing the above is a bitter truth serum. There is obviously self-blame, even though Dr.
Beavis, in our first conversation, tried very strongly to dissuade me of that. If I knew then
what I know now, I like to think that I would not have been so cavalier about ignoring my
symptoms. And I would encourage *any woman* with symptoms like the ones I describe
to seek medical help immediately. So let this be a cautionary tale. But it is what it is. In
my defense (more rationalizations coming, or simply reasonable explanations?), ovarian
cancer, the so-called ""silent killer,"" is notoriously asymptomatic, often not becoming fully
symptomatic until it's late stage (which was my case, as I was diagnosed at stage IIIC).
Until April, my symptoms were indeed mild and easily confusable with weight gain, extra
belly fat as a result of not exercising often enough etc. Several girlfriends reported
similar types of bloating in conjunction with their periods. Further, it is not certain at all
that a sonogram in January would have revealed cancer; in fact, once I had the
sonogram in March, it showed something suspicious on my left ovary but did not detect
the more serious problem area on my right ovary, because that area was located higher
up in my abdominal cavity than the sonogram could detect.
I could likely have done more. And that's an awful truth to accept. I also could have done
less, ignoring the symptoms even when they became alarming. But I did not. What's
most important for me right now, in the end, is to be completely and ceaselessly
proactive about my treatment going forward. And I believe I'm succeeding in that.

Spring has arrived, with its delicate sunlight and pretty pink and yellow flowers. I
remember sitting by an open window in the rocker with Ben, then an infant, in the weeks
following his birth on 4 April, and literally watching the buds fatten and bloom over the
course of those first few weeks. It seemed as if Ben and the earth were coming to life
simultaneously, and since then I've always felt that early April was a most poetic time for
a birthday. Then on the 19th of that month, I turned on the t.v. as I prepared to nurse
Ben, only to witness the horrific images of the Oklahoma City bombing, including of small
children, covered with debris and blood, being evacuated. Horror amidst the beauty - an
early lesson. And not the 'agreeable horror' of the sublime, but unmitigated horror linked
to evil and mass destruction. 
This year Ben's twenty-fifth birthday came amidst another wave of mass destruction, this
one wreaked by nature. And Ben certainly understood that in the face of so much
calamity, this bday would necessarily be different. So our celebration was a bit tamped
down, but I was still intent on observing this important milestone. I awoke early on
Saturday morning (Ben's bday) and made a yummy chocolate mousse from Patricia
Wells' Paris bistro cookbook.This actually tired me out a bit (all that beating of egg yolks
and whites, not to mention of the whipped cream!), as I still get fatigued during the day.
But I pressed on and in the afternoon cooked fesenjoon, a delicious Persian chicken stew
with pomegranate molasses and ground walnuts that I have enjoyed in a Persian
restaurant in Paris. Ben, meanwhile, had driven to D.C. Friday afternoon to pick up his
girlfriend, Sammi, who was not faring entirely well in isolation and who had been self-
quarantining for several weeks. Sammi will stay with Ben's dad and stepmom for the
foreseeable future while Ben stays here. I would have liked for all of us to be together on
Ben's bday but we are trying to minimize contact, especially in my case. So Ben and I
drove to Michael's the next day to deliver three portions of the chocolate mousse and to
chat a bit with Sammi, at a six foot distance. My bday present for Ben, ordered long ago
off Amazon, will not arrive for several more weeks.
These were all very minor adjustments, though, and we fully realize how privileged we
are, as well as comparatively safe in State College, where our local hospital is only
treating two COVID-19 patients and where our county has so far counted about forty
cases. This past weekend, within three days, we lost not only my cousin Ruth but her
husband, my mother's first cousin Gene, both victims of COVID in Toronto.
While mellower than usual, Ben's bday was lovely and to top it off we enjoyed watching a
few episodes of our newest guilty pleasure, Tiger King, a disturbing and fascinating
documentary with an appropriately eerie, 'end times' vibe.
Every parent wants to keep her/his kid/s safe. As long as Ben and Sammi are here in
State College, I feel (rightly or wrongly) that I can ensure their safety. But I know too that
                       418 / 1.901
their relatively privileged lifestyle is not shared by many millennials who, unlike Ben, are
crippled by student debt, have little savings, and now face uncertain job prospects at a
time when they should be launching their careers, relationships and other foundational
aspects of their lives. I feel so badly for them. What kind of world will these kids confront
once we return to 'normal?' Ben said to me one day recently: ""There's nothing to look
forward to.""
I am still feeling pretty well, thank goodness, but I can't say I'm fully recovered by any
means. I did walk a mile the other day! My overall stamina is increasing. And I am
boasting some nice curves due to weight loss (but yes, what a way to lose the pounds,
and also: I'm all curvy with no place to go...). I just pray that my remission will continue
and that I can avoid a return to chemo for as long as possible.
A virtual happy hour (dubbed ""l'heure heureuse"") with my grad school besties made me
happy this past Friday. Not the same as in person of course, but a warming hour and a
half nevertheless. So happy to see Isa and Rob, Vinni, Shanny and Sally safely ensconced
in their living rooms and kitchens, enjoying an apéritif (a virgin one for me...). Shanny
even got our her crystal, now a bit of a ritual when we gather, so we could ask it some
questions about what the future holds.
Stay well and safe, everyone.

120,"We managed to have a lovely Passover, Ben and I, despite all the constraints, perhaps
first among them limiting our Seder to a party of two, whereas large gatherings of family
and friends have most always been our norm. Intent on approximating at least some of
my own personal rituals around the Seder, I cooked several dishes -- matzah farfel
stuffing with sauteed mushrooms and onions; tzimmes of carrots, butternut squash,
sweet potatoes and prunes; chicken thighs in a honey mustard sauce (a pale cousin of
""Mrs. Schindler's chicken,"" a recipe my aunt shared with me years ago that has since
become a holiday favorite); and apple compote. My biggest culinary regret is that I didn't
have the 'fixins' to make chicken soup w/matzah balls this year, nor chopped liver, which
I sometimes prepare as well. The cooking, admittedly, made me tired (although I'm an
old hand at ""cook 'til you drop,"" usually spreading my holiday cooking out over several
full days). I'm not back to full energy yet, and needed to take breaks to lie down on my
bed. I also enjoyed setting a pretty table with my 'nice' (ie wedding) china, Lenox seder
plate, candlesticks and kiddush cup, platter for matzah, and some colorful orchid plants.
As the friend kind enough to shop for me couldn't find a shank bone, I put a post-it on
the plate in its stead!
Ben and I read from two different haggadot as we retold (and in theory, 'relived') the
story of the exodus from Egypt, the passage from slavery to freedom. Along with the
traditional blessings during candle lighting, I read a ""Prayer for Passover in the Era of
COVID-19,"" which I found quite meaningful (from the Reform Judaism
website: https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2020/04/06/prayer-passover-era-covid-19) Other
current resonances of the story struck me too: the Egyptians and ""people of Israel""
""sheltering in place"" as God assailed them with plagues (we counted not ten but eleven,
the last one being the one we're living through now); the trials of hunger and suffering
(we are enjoined to invite anyone who is hungry to come eat our Passover table, and I
wish I could have done just that); the value of perseverance and courage in finding one's
                       426 / 1.901
way out of a 'narrow place of bondage' (mitzrayim/Egypt); the promise of redemption
and an end to suffering, augured by the prophet Elijah. I told Ben that my cancer journey
has often felt like it was requiring 'biblical' quantities (and qualities) of courage and
strength. As every year, I'm left with questions about the story: was it really necessary
for God to slay the Egyptians' first-born sons? What kind of God seeks retribution in this
cruel way? Still, it was meaningful for us to discuss the story, which we followed with a
few not necessarily traditional songs (although we did sing a spirited ""Dayenu""): Linda
Hirschorn's ""Circle Chant,"" which I love (""Circle round for freedom/Circle round for
peace/For all of us imprisoned/Circle for release/Circle for the planet/Circle for each
soul/For the children of our children/Keep the circle whole"")
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I-UiDzeexU)
and ""Miriam's Song,"" which we used to sing with Ben when he was little, about Moses'
sister Miriam and the other Israelite women ""dancing with their timbrels"" after they had
crossed through the Red Sea.
After dinner we FaceTimed with Ben's Berkman family in Amherst, MA, and with my
brother and family in the city. Several of the men are now sporting pretty wild-looking
beards! Nice to feel connected to family but hope that next year we'll be able to gather
with loved ones.
I continue to feel pretty well overall, sort of status quo. I do have some occasionally achy
areas in my abdomen, one near the incision the other on my right side, near the site of
the actual surgery. I've written my surgeon several times to figure out how to distinguish
between abdominal surgical pain and pain due to something else, but have not heard
back. I know I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but I'm getting paranoid about cancer
patients being overlooked against the backdrop of coronavirus. A recent NPR story
reported on just this, but in my particular case I have no evidence to support this
suspicion. I will just need to be a bit more persistent. And for the most part my health
*does* appear to continuously improve. Fingers crossed.
There will always be another gloss on the Passover/Easter convergence for me, and not a
pleasant one. By Passover last year (it fell later in April than this year) I was not feeling
well at all. A few days before Passover, a sonogram had revealed what appeared to be a
growth on one of my ovaries (as I mentioned in another post, a growth on the *other*
ovary, undetected by the sonogram, turned out to be much more problematic). I was
scheduled to have a follow-up test after Easter to confirm these initial results. I felt
freaked out, and in my recollection (admittedly, much 'fuzz' surrounds this period for me)
did not share the information with many people at all, intent on waiting for the follow-up
test. But I did tell my friend Monique -- I remember tears, fear, trepidation. She managed
to calm me down and convinced me to not rush to the worst-case scenario until I had
more information. So the Hillel-sponsored Passover seder we attended on campus
shortly after that was a strange affair for me -- and likely Monique too. Surrounded by
students we didn't know for the most part, we felt a bit out of our element, even as I
                       427 / 1.901
gamely attempted to chat up a very sullen, largely silent grad student at our table while
the three undergrads across from us remained glued to their cell phones. But the event
wasn't unpleasant, and the food was tasty. Throughout dinner I felt preoccupied and
worried, though, by the recent sonogram results. Once home, I sank into my couch,
exhausted and stressed. Easter would soon bring another blow.
Sorry to end on this sad note in the midst of the holiday season. Wishing everyone the
blessings of good health, peace and a sense of renewal.

121,"I'm gazing at the lovely pink-purple lilacs that my friend Sandy brought me the other
day, along with a Passover-themed dinner of roast chicken with tsimmes and a potato
kugel (all delicious). At this time of year, as if on cue, fragrant lilacs bloom along ""Deans'
Walk,"" a path on campus that runs under the deans' offices in Sparks Building. They
were blooming a year ago at this time. Since then, the earth has completed its orbital
path, its revolution around the sun. 
The good news, as Ben reminded me the other day, is that I'm doing much better than I
was a year ago, although it's been quite an odyssey. Last year on Easter I had been
suffering from worrisome constipation for several days. Worrisome, because none of the
known remedies, including lots of dried fruit and water, walking, yoga stretches etc.
seemed to 'work'. Later I found out that what was causing the blockage were lesions in
my colon... I became so alarmed that I jumped in my car and drove to Med Express, only
to learn that there would be a wait as long as four hours (on Easter?...). Then, almost on
autopilot, I did something I'd never done before: I drove myself to the ER at our local
hospital. The very young, rookie-looking ER doctor on call that day examined me,
pressing against my stomach, and then sent me to have a CT-scan. I remember the
technician asking me, after I had the scan, ""how long have you not been feeling well?""
and then looking pointedly at me and saying: ""Good luck."" The young doc came in a bit
later, hurriedly, flustered, showed me the CT image, and said something like: ""The
radiologist has looked at your imaging and believes he sees a malignancy."" (To be
honest, the only word I definitely remember hearing was 'malignancy'). The doctor then
showed me the image and indicated all the places -- body parts such as 'omentum,'
whose names I had never heard before, along with familiar organs such as the ovaries --
where a malignancy had been detected. Strangely, though, he hastened to tell me that
""this doesn't mean for sure that you have cancer,"" and he counseled me to make an
appointment asap with an ob-gyn oncological surgeon at Geisinger medical center in
Danville.
                       428 / 1.901
To be honest, the rest of the day was a blur. My friend Clare, whom I had planned to
meet for tea, came to my house and talked me down from hysteria, helping me focus on
the immediate tasks at hand, such as making plans to consult a gyn-onc in Danville. She
was kind enough to stay overnight with me (and to buy the medication I needed to
relieve the constipation); I'll always be grateful to her for this. I had heart-wrenching
conversations with my mother, brother, Michael and Ben, stressing though that I awaited
a definitive diagnosis from a specialist. The irony of receiving this awful blow on Easter --
a day of renewal, rebirth, redemption and the promise of life eternal that also turned out
to be one of the worst days of my life -- crossed my mind at some point. But my thoughts
became a tangled jumble, and by the time I went to bed I was exhausted.
Yes, happily doing better for now (although how could I ever have anticipated, that day
in the ER, the plague that would hit us all a year later, compounding my concern about
my health?). I'm looking forward to driving this week for the first time since early March,
and to working some raw fruits and veggies into my diet. Easter this year passed quietly.
The previous day Ben and I drove over the mountains and down into the next valley,
where in the largely Amish village of Belleville horses were plowing, farmers hoeing, and
plain black clothing fluttering in the wind on clothes lines. It smelled earthy, like spring!
We crossed over a creek where a horse and buggy had stopped so that the driver could
fly fish. It all felt rather idyllic and reminded me that the earth's revolutions bring beauty
and stability as the seasons change, a counterpoint to all the uncertainty currently
unsettling us. 
Ben is at Michael and Sue's this week but I expect that he (or he and Sammi) will return
here next week or the week after. We are so happy to have them here until they feel
comfortable returning to D.C.
I have been enjoying some 'fun' reading recently -- Julian Barnes' _The Man in the Red
Coat_ (the title alludes to a portrait by Sargent of Samuel Pozzi, a renowned surgeon and
society figure of the Belle Epoque) and now Ann Patchett's latest, _The Dutch House._

This is the longest break I've taken from my blog since I started writing last June.
Everything had been going along smoothly, without much 'news' to report, almost with a
certain insouciance on my part due to the sameness of days and routine, walks in the
neighborhood, long nighttime sleeps, nice dinners at home with Ben and Sammi,
watching the tube after dinner (the ESPN series on Michael Jordan and the Bulls is
awesome). All of this, of course, against a deeply worrisome backdrop apparent in the
NYTimes headlines that I probably shouldn't look at - but do - first thing when I wake up.
...until yesterday's bloodwork punctured the reassuring rhythm of the days and my
confidence that I could *will* a non-return to any kind of medical office. Admittedly, for
the past while (few weeks? since my last surgery?) my stomach/digestive system have
felt a bit 'unhappy' (as a friend aptly put it), without going into too much detail. Trying to
tweak my dose of Imodium hasn't seemed to help much and there's been some
discomfort on my right side, which I've attributed to surgical pain. At the same time, I felt
frustrated to not have received a response to four or five emails I sent Dr. Fang (who
performed the last surgery) about my feeling a bit 'off.' This led me instead to call my
(ex) bro-in-law, David, a gastroenterologist, who encouraged me to reach out to my
broader team of doctors, and to have bloodwork done -- which Dr. Patel promptly
ordered. 
Yesterday afternoon, I went to Dr. Patel's office -- rather empty and therefore a bit eerie
-- for the labs and a port flush. It was the first time I had been in a medical facility since
leaving Hopkins on 16 March and thus my first encounter with a 'masked' and often
gloved population. What a strange, depressing and anxiety-provoking - albeit necessary -
mode of social interaction. In any event, Dr. Patel called me shortly after I returned home
to tell me that two of my four markers for liver function were 'significantly' elevated. He
said that he wanted to wait until the CA125 number (ovarian cancer marker) came in the
following day to suggest next steps. That number came in this morning at 34.6. This is
about ten 'points' above what is was last time (25, I believe) but still, I think, at the upper
limit of what's considered 'normal' (35). So next step is an abdominal sonogram
tomorrow morning and a redo of the blood work next week.
Fortunately I had a therapy session today, which helped me temper the panic response
that the news about the liver function markers induced in me. H. reminded me that panic
serves a useful purpose, grabbing our attention and directing it to something that may
well need it to be directed to. And we agreed that, while I often tend to catastrophize
and run to worst-case scenarios (liver cancer following the removal of a small patch of
my liver last May? the necessity of returning to Hopkins, aka COVID-central, absent the
reassuring presence of family?), it's counterproductive for me to lean too heavily into
those thoughts in the absence of more complete information. Instead, I am leaning into
the fact that I have a stellar, rock-solid support network and also that I 'know the drill,' as
far as this illness goes. And -- as I repeated to myself out loud several times today -- in
my mind, I've already been through the worst, ie the initial cancer diagnosis and
                       431 / 1.901
debulking surgery. I can likely deal with whatever might be thrown at me next.
I'll keep everyone posted.
'The worst' began to transpire exactly a year ago, during the last week of classes, ie this
current week, the week the lilacs, as if on cue, spring into fragrant bloom along ""Deans'
walk,"" a path that runs along the windows of the Liberal Arts deans' offices. On Tuesday
of this week, a year ago, my kind friend Gay drove me to Geisinger Medical Center in
Danville, where I met with a gyn onc surgeon, Dr. Gogoi, whom my doctors here in State
College had set me up with. As I didn't know what the options were at that point
regarding treatment, I thought she seemed competent. I remember certain sound bites,
such as: ""If you've been advised to come here for an appointment, you must know it's
fairly serious"" and ""You need to feel comfortable with me, as this may be the beginning
of a long relationship"" (I received a form letter a few months later announcing her
imminent departure from her practice). She performed a pelvic exam on me that was
horrifically painful because of the cancer. I was in tears nearly the whole time, and Gay
showed a lot of fortitude in remaining 'present' for me. We went to Friendly's after the
appointment and had ice cream cones. I felt drained. Such a difficult day. It also
happened to coincide with the second to last session of my course on France and the
Holocaust, which my intern, Morgane, kindly took over for me while I was at Danville. I
think that class knew vaguely that there was something 'wrong;' I could tell by their
worried or confused expressions when I returned for the last class on Thursday, rising to
the occasion as best I could.
Also that week -- but my timeline may be fuzzy -- in a panic but still managing to think
somewhat clear-sightedly, I contacted my college classmate (and former dorm mate),
Steven Sherman, who I knew was a prominent physician at the Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston. We likely hadn't spoken since college (although we are Facebook friends),
but Steve without hesitation offered to see if he could connect me with doctors at world-
class medical centers within striking distance from State College (""we'll get you
situated,"" he said). A flurry of emails, phone calls, and faxed test results later, Steve had
spoken with colleagues at Hopkins. A day or two later, I received a phone call from the
wonderful Dr. Anna Beavis (perhaps more on that thread another time). Steve will always
be one of my angels -- or perhaps rather a great doctor? a trusted friend and classmate?
a mensch? All of the above?
About the same time I reached out to Marty, the father of a childhood friend of Ben's,
whose wife had battled OC for a good eight years (he's also a PSU colleague in the
sciences). As with Steve, I intuited that these people might be my needed 'anchors' at a
time when I felt completely adrift, drowning in a loss of certainty about *anything.* Marty
came to my office, hugged me warmly, asked questions, and shared the early 'narrative'
of Wendy's cancer - her symptoms, their search for the best treatment, his assessment
of how family dynamics changed etc. I remember, again, being in a very 'ramped up,'
                       432 / 1.901
panicked state during that conversation (I was talking very quickly, kept breaking down
etc.). While I've been less frequently in touch w/Marty recently, I know that he's still part
of my 'village' and a trusted support.
Around the same too, finally - the days in a two-week or so period all meld together in
my memory -- I was in a monthly meeting with the heads of the other language/literature
departments. I kept getting calls from Geisinger, including one during which Dr. Gogoi
confirmed my ovarian cancer diagnosis, each time returning to my meeting after having
to leave the room to take the call. Embarrassed at having to run in and out of the room,
devastated, my mind racing, I sat through the rest of the meeting before getting out
through my tears to two of my colleagues who had lingered in the conference room: ""I
have cancer."" They were, of course, empathic, hugging me as did a third colleague
whose office I barged into to explain why I had had to keep disrupting the meeting.
Those nightmare days seem, in some ways, long ago, thankfully. This journey's made me
stronger for sure. I want to live to experience another blessed day - even (or maybe
especially) in the midst of a plague - to be able to look at my pretty orchid plants on my
dining room table, next to the 2000 piece puzzle that Ben and Sammi have almost
finished, to trade emails and texts with friends and family, and to enjoy a nice dinner at
home followed by a sound night's sleep. More than enough to be thankful for, I'm sure.",5,sadness,0.8822341,0.009906791,0.004405689,0.056787595,0.0028812597,0.0068196375,0.8822341,0.036964923
123,"My sonogram this morning revealed ""no abnormal findings"" and a""normal appearing
liver"" -- thank God! I was so anxious, and feel so relieved. The mystery of the
suspiciously high liver marker numbers remains to be solved, for my own peace of mind
at least, and I'll begin by having my bloodwork repeated early next week. The emotional
                       433 / 1.901
roller coaster, with a healthy life often seemingly in the balance, is one of the hardest
aspects of this cancer journey. But for now -- huge sigh of relief and thankfulness.

124,"I've been busy the past few days preparing for, then participating in, a dissertation
defense, reading a second student's dissertation, and writing up questions for Ph.D.
comps, among other work tasks -- and that's a good thing. A year ago today I could do
none of that. In fact, today is what I'm calling my 'alive day,' not necessarily in the way
that veterans refer to it (as the day they survived being severely wounded in battle) but
to mean the day I survived ""the mother of all surgeries"" and was rid of 99% of the visible
cancer invading my body. It was the day I got a second chance.
If I have my chronology straight, on 6 May 2019 my brother Ethan rented a car and
drove from New York to pick me up in State College before we headed to Baltimore. I
                       436 / 1.901
knew that this was a huge 'ask' on my part as I rarely request favors of this magnitude
from my brother. But he immediately rearranged his schedule to help me. Your being
there when I needed it most has not been forgotten, Ethan. My brother had actually
never been to visit me at my present address, but we didn't linger long. We lunched on a
couple of salads I had picked up from Trader Joe's and were then Baltimore-bound. I was
wearing yoga pants and an old pink Penn State hoodie that I throw on when I want to
feel both comfortable and comforted (on long plane rides for example), as my abdomen
ached and I generally felt ill. During our drive on a pretty spring day, we caught up on
some family news, the chitchat also comforting despite the undercurrent of anxiety. 
Unfortunately, the hotel we had booked was in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, which
added stress. As I recall, Ben joined us from D.C. and the three of us went to dinner at a
not great Turkish (?-Ethan will remember) restaurant. We kept up the small talk but
again I could tell we all felt tense over what was looming. I tried to take deep breaths
and stay as calm as possible. I had cried so much during the previous week that I simply
felt worn out and ready to get on with the surgery.
The following day I had my first meeting with Dr. Beavis (Ethan and Ben accompanied
me), with whom I had only spoken by phone once previously and who was to perform my
surgery the next day, as she was leaving shortly after that for a European cycling
vacation. Again, I consider it a tremendous stroke of luck that, in rapid succession and
just about a week earlier, I had contacted my college friend Steve Sherman who in turn
reached out to colleagues at Hopkins who then set me up with Dr. Beavis, who just
happened to have one opening for surgery the following week.The meeting with Dr.
Beavis is something of a blur because much of what she told me (regarding prognosis for
ovarian cancer patients, for example) felt scary and devastating, as also mirrored in the
tear-filled, bleary-eyed faces of my brother and Ben, so painful for me to witness. She
described in detail the 'debulking' surgery she would perform. This would entail a
meticulous removal of the visible cancer; a liver surgeon, Dr. Burns, would also be on
hand as some cancer has 'blown' off my ovary like dandelion fluff onto my liver. What
reassured me were Dr. Beavis' clear explanations and kind manner, already in evidence
when I had spoken with her on the phone and she had asked me about my support
system before anything else. I left her office feeling stunned. We headed to the
pharmacy to pick up a few medications that I would need for a bowel prep that night.
Back at the hotel, my mother had arrived (again if I'm remembering correctly). At some
point, my mother, brother and Ben must have eaten dinner as I had to fast. The
Gatorade and other liquids I needed to drink made me sick to my stomach and I
continued to vomit throughout a sleepless night, the lowest point of this 'prologue' to my
surgery. We were all upset and Ben and I were clinging to each other as I tried to
comfort him. My instinct is to draw a veil across that evening because it was so
traumatic.
                       437 / 1.901
I believe we arrived at the hospital several hours before my surgery, scheduled for early
afternoon. As I lay in a bay in the pre-op unit, the anesthesiologist came by to introduce
himself and I believe we saw Drs. Beavis and Burns as well. I remember climbing onto
the operating table by myself in a large, very brightly lit room buzzing with activity. The
next I remember is waking up in the ICU. The operation had taken thirteen hours so it
spanned May 8th and 9th; Dr. Beavis had emerged from surgery to talk to my family at
about 1:00 a.m. on the 9th and said that the operation had gone well. The four of them
had all left the hospital together as Dr. Beavis' fiance was picking her (and her bicycle)
up. Meanwhile, I was intubated and gagging; I gestured frantically at a blurry figure near
my bed to remove the tube but she said she couldn't yet. She encouraged me to relax
and showed me the pump I could press to release pain medicine at five minute intervals.
That helped. My glasses had been removed so I could barely make anything out, but if I
squinted I could read the wall clock: 6 a.m. As I became more alert, I also became more
conscious of the pain. But for the moment, disoriented and groggy, I was awake enough
to realize that I was alive - and that was plenty.
So on this one-year anniversary of my 'alive day,' I've been to the farmers market
(masked and gloved), have sent work emails, straightened my house a bit, and may
treat myself to some clothes shopping now that stores have reopened here. My digestive
system is still kinda 'wonky' from my second surgery (which, while 'only' six hours,
turned out to be the doozy), but I'm generally feeling pretty well. The troubling liver
enzyme markers detected in a blood test two weeks ago have come down but are still
above normal; I'll have my blood retested in a week in the hopes that they've come
down further. And I'll see Dr. Patel, my oncologist here, in June for a routine visit,
including bloodwork to assess my CA125 number.
I'm looking forward to a lovely Mother's Day tomorrow with Ben and Sammi. I spent the
last one in the hospital.

125,"On rereading my previous post, I think I did a credible job in narrating the events of a
year ago, ie the period encompassing my cancer diagnosis and surgery. But conveying
my state of mind at the time is harder, partly because I've repressed some of the
memories. I'm sharing below something I wrote during that period when, up close and
personal with the reality of my own mortality, I somehow felt compelled to leave traces
of myself in a series of affirmations. I would sit down and write one or more in moods
ranging from frantic to sorrowful to nostalgic to serene. And then I would repeat them
like mantras.I actually feel peaceful and happy reading these now, although that was not
the mood that inspired them.

126,"Dear friends, On Sunday 7 June I will be participating, in State College, in the 2020 Stride and Thrive
run/walk, organized under the aegis of Johns Hopkins Medical Center, as an ovarian cancer survivor. All
proceeds will support gynecologic cancer research and clinical trials, training for gynecologic oncology
fellows, and gynecologic cancer survivors through the Susan L. Burgert, M.D. Gynecologic Oncology
Survivorship Program. Last year, the race raised more than $240,000 and had 900 participants! I would be
honored if you would consider joining my team, #willapower, which will entail your walking 1 mile or
running 5k on June 7th, wherever you are (as unfortunately we can't be in Baltimore this year due to
COVID-19). To register (the $40 registration fee will go directly to the fundraising total), go
to charmcityrun.com/hopkins. Should you wish to make a donation without participating in the walk/run,
please go to runsignup.com/willapower. Please contact me should you have questions. Thank you for
                       443 / 1.901
considering a contribution to this Important (and important to *me*) cause!
My personal note (from my fundraising page):
In April 2019, after experiencing a period of mild abdominal bloating (OC is notoriously
asymptomatic), I was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian cancer (because it is notoriously
asymptomatic OC is usually diagnosed at stage III or IV). Last May I underwent a thirteen
hour 'debulking' sugery at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, during which 99% of the
*visible* cancer was removed from my body, followed by six rounds of chemotherapy. In
March of this year I underwent major abdominal surgery, also at Hopkins, to take down a
fistula and to remove parts of my colon and small intestine. I have been in remission
since November and am generally feeling well. I have been back at work since January. 
Over the past year, I have received extraordinary treatment at Johns Hopkins, from a
medical team directed by my surgeon, Dr. Ann Beavis, a gynecological oncologist. As
you may know, Hopkins is at the cutting edge of cancer research and treatment, but
much more work remains to be done to combat these awful 'below the belt' cancers.. I
would be honored and grateful if you would join me on Sunday 7 June, either in running
(5 k) or walking (1 mile) as part of team #willapower or in making a donation at
runsignup.com/willapower. Thank you!",2,fear,0.68630177,0.017240481,0.00047563724,0.68630177,0.19005641,0.029862305,0.053659607,0.02240374

I'm currently having a few health concerns (*just edited this as I had written ""having few
health concerns"" - wishful thinking?), which I indeed hope will turn out to be no more
than 'blips.' A third blood workup, this past Monday, following the revelation of extremely
high liver enzyme counts a few weeks ago, has shown these markers to be stable from
the last blood test, ie still elevated, less so than the time before -- but stable. So I'll have
more blood taken in two more weeks. Meanwhile, as I last reported I believe (?), a
sonogram of my liver revealed no apparent abnormalities, thankfully. Still, my mind of
course races towards the worst case scenario (cancer in my liver?) while wondering
about the persistent ache along my lower right rib cage, in the vicinity, I believe, of my
liver (gosh, I wish I knew my anatomy better, but as usual since my cancer diagnosis, I'm
caught up in an approach/avoidance pattern), At the same time, some persistent
discomfort on my right side -- reminiscent of the discomfort I felt with my fistula (ugh) --
led me to question whether this is still surgical discomfort (""your body's been through a
lot,"" said Dr. Beavis) or something new and unwelcome. And then I read on some
random website that -- TMI alert ahead -- excessive gas (guilty as charged) can be a
symptom of ovarian cancer. And *then* I read (or was reminded of? who knows what
other frightful facts I've blocked out at this point), in an online post by someone
undergoing OC treatment, that 'high grade serous' OC is both the most common type yet
also the one with the lowest survival rate. In any event, all of this led me to recontact Dr.
Fang, my colorectal surgeon, who had not responded to my previous 3-4 emails, leading
me to retreat in frustration for a while. This time she responded immediately, saying that
a CT-scan was advisable. So back I go for a CT-scan of my abdominal and pelvic areas
next Wednesday, in State College. Fingers crossed for a good result. In the meantime, I
am trying not to ""borrow worries,"" as my aunt Marlene aptly put it.
It's amazing how my internal switch can instantly turn me from a (self-perceived)
'healthy Willa' into 'sick Willa' -- almost Jekyll and Hyde personas. These kinds of 'blips'
automatically discombobulate me, switching off my good mood and generally well- (or at
least ok-)feeling state and sending me tumbling into bleakness, depression and worst-
case scenario land. So I've been bumping around a bit between the two extremes the
past few days. Ugh.
Today I was able to pull myself up a good bit, however (or maybe it's just the Lexapro).
This morning, I reviewed and then discussed with my wonderful interim department head
(and friend), Bénédicte, all manner of Excel spread sheets and summaries for our budget
meeting with the Dean and college CFO next week. Delving into the details and thinking
ahead to the next academic year (and to its possibilities and challenges) actually helped
me forget about the discomfort in my side. After lunch, Sammi and I set off on an
'adventure' (or at least what passes for one in these parts), heading about 45 mn out of
State College on very pretty country roads (large working farms shrouded in mist today)
towards Mill Hall (or rather the hamlet of Salona) to a newish Amish market housed in an
                       448 / 1.901
old schoolhouse and featuring produce and meat, baked goods, plants, crafts and a flea
market. I bought free range eggs, fresh local asparagus, fresh spinach, dill pickles, and a
pretty planter for the front porch -- all reasonably priced. Unfortunately, a)not everyone
was wearing a mask, which made me nervous and b) the market was 'festooned' with
large Trump signs -- all seemingly part and parcel in this rural neck of the woods...
Nevertheless, I am delighted that 'farmers market season' is upon us and think I have by
now made most of the dishes one can make with rhubarb -- cobbler, crisp, compote,
vinaigrette (I guess this weekend, after stocking up at our local Saturday farmers market
tomorrow, I can produce a pie, cake, chutney or syrup).
So if ""it's not time yet"" (a mantra many of my friends and I have been repeating to one
another) for travel and other activities, at least we can enjoy the local benefits -- an
explosion of produce, great hiking trails, peaceful gurgling streams etc. On Mothers Day
Ben and Sammi cooked me brunch, then we drove out to one of my favorite creeks, past
more farms. Sure beats last Mothers Day, which I spent in the hospital. It was very
comforting to have my own mother with me that day, but Ben was at a meeting (in
Florida, I think). On his return (I was still in the hospital, spent three weeks there, in fact),
he gifted me the photo (below) of him running in a half-marathon in Pittsburgh. Beyond
the fact that he looks like such a buff, toned, strong, handsome guy (which he is), the
picture has always spoken to me of perseverance, grit, determination, focus, and
'moving through:' 'the only way out is through,' something I have often told myself
during my own 'marathon.' I love this photo.
Finally, speaking of running, I am very excited about having formed a team to run/walk
in the ""Stride and Thrive"" 5k run/1 mile walk on 7 June, a fundraiser for ovarian cancer
research, treatment and survivor support organized by Hopkins. Usually the event is held
in Baltimore, but as it can't be this year, it is a virtual event. Friends will be running
walking here, in Michigan and in Boston and other friends have generously made
donations to this great cause (it's not too late to do that and/or to join team
#willapower); I've ordered #willapower shirts for the runners/walkers.
And this is reminding me that I had set three goals for this summer: to get back to Paris
(it doesn't look like that's going to happen); to attend the wedding of my friends Maria
and Greg in the White Mountains of NH (now postponed until next July due to COVID-19)
and to participate in ""Stride and Thrive"" in Baltimore (now a virtual event). So I'll be
walking (I hope...), but in State College. The best laid plans...

128,"I had hoped to title this entry ""Sometimes a blip is just a blip."" But no can do. Dr. Beavis
called me yesterday afternoon w/results of the CT-scan I had the other day (reviewed by
a Hopkins radiologist familiar w/my health history). She told me that it looks like I have a
partial obstruction in my small intestines, which could be causing or compounding some
of the discomfort I've been feeling in my abdominal area. So -- as when I had a bowel
obstruction a while back that landed me in the hospital -- I'm on a liquid diet for a few
days to see if that helps (currently drinking a mango protein drink). She was relieved to
know that I have not been vomiting (I haven't, at all), which would warrant a trip to the
ER.
More concerning are a few 'hazy' areas on the scan that *may* indicate a recurrence.
They appear to be on my right side and in the rectal area. It is also possible that this is
scar tissue or inflammation. So I have to have a PET scan, which produces better imaging
and 'lights up' areas that are cancerous. When I asked her whether she had a hunch
about which way this was going to go, she said she really did not, because my CA125
number (ovarian cancer marker), following my last blood test, was sort of borderline
(upper limits of normal). So I need to have that marker tested again too.
Dr. Fang (colorectal surgeon who operated on me in March) also called me this morning
to follow up. She again apologized for not responding to several emails I had sent (which
in my mind may [or may not] have delayed the process that's in motion now); she's been
operating every day, the hospital is very chaotic w/the advent of the coronavirus etc. I
am still annoyed that precious time may have been lost, but there's nothing to do about
it at this point. She said that from the perspective of the last operation everything looks
good: the hookup is 'pristine' (her word), no fistula etc. She did concur that my small
intestines look swollen. She said that Dr. Beavis was 'worried' that I may have a
recurrence but said ""We don't have all the information yet, so let's wait until you have
the PET scan."" When I asked her about Dr. Beavis having told me that they saw no
cancer when they operated on me in March, Dr. Fang reminded me that they would not
have been able to see any cancer that was of microscopic size. She (Dr. Fang) also put
my mind to rest about some other 'oddities' of my digestive system that I've been
concerned about.
When Dr. Beavis brought up the possibility of a recurrence, I was naturally gripped with
mortal dread, translated into all the physiological symptoms you might see in a horror
movie (rapid heart beat, gulping etc.). I felt (and continue to feel, when I think about it)
                       456 / 1.901
that I'm dangling over some sort of black hole. But I was able to calm down some, thanks
in part to Ben and Sammi's help, and that of my friend Diane, an OC survivor who has
also had scar tissue mistaken for something potentially worse on scans. I won't use this
page to indulge my worst case scenario fantasies, but will simply get on with my day,
which includes two Zoom meetings this morning and then car shopping w/Ben (for me!
We thought about putting this off given the recent update, but decided that we'd at least
go look and perhaps select what I'd like to buy eventually). It's a beautiful day here.
Shabbat shalom.
Thanks, everyone, for your support. Each of your 'hearts' (both the icons and the real
ones) and your messages is a gift to me. Big love,",4,neutral,0.42951906,0.13156371,0.17442968,0.04227128,0.0049180742,0.42951906,0.15595254,0.0613457

Thanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good thoughts and/or prayers my
way tomorrow morning, when I have a PET scan to take a closer look at two 'hazy' spots
from my CT-scan that Dr. Beavis and a Hopkins radiologist are concerned may be
cancerous. I had blood taken today that will reveal my CA125 number. I received
notification nearly immediately that the results of that test are in, and I can likely consult
them via the Geisinger portal, but I'm too anxious to do so. I will wait for Dr. Beavis or Dr.
Patel to share them with me once the PET scan results are also in.
Meanwhile, though, my crampy stomach ache (resulting from a partially blocked small
intestine, also noted on my CT scan) is much better, as I've been on a mainly liquid diet
since Friday. I still do have that niggling discomfort on my right side, one of the spots
that Dr. Beavis is concerned about. It's not at all bad, but it's there.
My worst moments emotionally over the weekend took me to strange, often unexpected
places. For the first time, I was feeling frustrated and angry about the whole situation (I
think I had forgotten to take my Lexapro that morning, which I now consider essential). I
have much too much that I want to accomplish for all this to be happening! It's not fair!
There were some weird almost out of body moments when I simply stood still and took
stock visually of the myriad 'things' surrounding me that make me 'me:' my orchid
plants, souvenir Eiffel towers on my kitchen table, pretty jewelry that I love wearing etc.
etc.
Not all the places I journeyed to were sad. I had a very  nice dream about Nightingale-
Bamford, the all-girls school I attended from grade 2 through grade 12: a formative
experience, including the friendships forged with my thirty-odd classmates with whom I
literally grew up. In the dream, it was the day of the annual NBS fair. I traveled uptown
on the bus (as the adult I am now, but it was the route I took as a girl) to 92nd street and
Madison. When I got off the bus, I saw little NBS girls in their blue uniforms ('pinnies' or
pleated skirts, like the ones I wore) lining up around the block to enter the school
building to attend the fair. I also saw, across a broad square that was as large as some
Parisian squares, not like your typical NY crosswalk, my classmates Lisa and Zia waving
excitedly at me, yelling something like ""This is the place!"" or ""This is where it all
happened,"" or ""It's all here."" My classmate Eva (something about her both marrying and
having her ears pierced later in life) also appeared in the dream, as did our dear
classmate Debbie, my friend since we were six years old, who passed away about three
years ago from metastatic breast cancer.
In my dream last night, I saw at least one very pretty hamsa (the protective 'hand' that is
supposed to ward off the evil eye; I have worn them often as pendants during the past
year). This one was very much my style (or one of my styles): Victorian/'chintzy'/floral
looking with a pretty Victorian looking heart and flowers worked into it. It looked like it
                       461 / 1.901
could have been made by Michal Negrin, a popular Israeli costume jeweler I like who
often works Victorian motifs into her pieces.
Despite my anxiety, I had a pleasant enough weekend and generally feel well. As people
are venturing out more these days, cautiously, I caught up with both my friend Maria and
my friend Gay during strolls in Penn State's arboretum, resplendent right now in purple
and pink and blue (see pic). Also went to the farmers market (per usual on Saturday
morning), TJ Maxx (outdoor plant stands) and drove out to an Amish greenhouse in Brush
Valley.
I don't know if I mentioned my recent shopping 'rampage.' Unfortunately as I can easily
see it becoming a bad habit, I've discovered online shopping during the pandemic. I
bought several 'big ticket items' -- a bigger t.v. and a t.v. stand, a new office chair and --
wait for it -- a new car (a 2020 Toyota Corolla SXE in snazzy ""crush metallic blue"" to
replace my now sixteen year old Corolla). And then there was a cast iron skillet (I've
already made cornbread), a whole mess of makeup from Clinique, Guerlain Mandarine
Basilic perfume (divine), address labels (needed) and personalized note cards. It was lots
of fun, but also felt like I was trying to construct some sort of 'bulwark' against whatever
might be coming down the road. ""I shop, therefore I am?"" to paraphrase Descartes?
My own personal dramas, the sense of the ""time being out of joint,"" are of course
unfolding against a terrifying fresco of fear and desperation caused by the pandemic,
righteous indignation and rage sparked by the (most) recent, blatant examples of
injustice and brutality in Minneapolis, and a total leadership vacuum (scarily combined
with an abundance of power). While my own fears sometimes run to keeping myself safe
(cancer + coronavirus = a bad combo), I also worry about how to keep the kids safe (Ben
and Sammi plan to move to NY this summer, w/Ben starting a grad program in data
science at NYU), how to keep my students safe, how to keep the next generations safe.
The scenes of looting in my hometown, a few blocks from my mother's apartment, are
particularly painful to watch. What's happening to our beloved country is awful to
witness.
In the meantime, I'm here. And I'm excited about Sunday's upcoming Stride and Thrive
event to benefit Hopkins' Kelly Gynecological Oncology Service. My team, #willapower,
has 14 runners/walkers, and I've raised more $ than I thought for this cause that is a
matter of life and death for so many women. The weather looks promising, we'll take
group photos in the t-shirts I had made, and I look forward to a joyous and meaningful
day. Please consider making a contribution in the next few days if you're able. You'll find
complete info in one of my recent blog posts. Thanks.

131,"Yesterday's PET scan turned out to be time consuming. I spent three hours at Gray's
Woods: they were running an hour late, then I had to wait an hour after consuming a
liquid that makes problem areas 'light up' in the imaging, the actual imaging took awhile,
and then I had to wait again for them to burn a disc for me so I could send it to Dr.
Beavis. The scene was somewhat chaotic: as the medical center is undergoing
construction, I was led out back to a *trailer* for the imaging, but the staff was quite
nice. By the time I was done, I was running late for my 3 p.m. appointment at the car
dealership, where I spent about an hour with the finance person going over a dizzying
mountain of information concerning my new car's operation, financing, warranties etc.
As I had barely eaten all day (I fasted for the procedure plus was still on a semi-liquid
diet to relieve my intestinal blockage) I was pretty much running on fumes by the point
(and was also radioactive lol). But I did speed off from the dealership in my very snazzy,
sporty, sexy METALLIC BLUE CRUSH Toyota SXE!
I spoke to Dr. Beavis for about 45 mn today. I'm detailing what she told me partly to
                       468 / 1.901
cement the myriad details in my own mind (she actually asked me to repeat back to her
the gist of what she had told me to make sure I understood what she was saying,
including the main takeaways). If this is tmi for you please feel free to skip ahead: She
said that she was ""suspicious but not confirmatory"" of a recurrence, based on the PET
scan images, which a Hopkins radiologist also read, plus the other evidence from the
blood work, especially the doubling of the CA125 marker. The areas that lit up on the PET
scan were around my colon and on my right side, somewhere near both a muscle (don't
remember the name of it) and my liver. But if there is cancer near my liver, it appears to
be on it and not *in* it, which is good. My entire colon lit up, which is unusual, but Dr.
Beavis thinks that several things may be going on there, not all of them possible cancer
growth (eg inflammation, scar tissue, potential infection etc.). Whatever is going on has
been caught early, also good. So, because nothing with this disease is straightforward, I
need now to have two more tests to explore further: an MRI and a stool sample to test
for C-diff (a bacterium causing chronic diarrhea, which I have, and colitis). If the MRI, in
turn, does not prove conclusive, I'll have another CT-scan six weeks after that. 
If there's been a recurrence, which I'm now expecting there has been, it will mean more
chemo, either as part of a clinical trial at Hopkins (if I'm eligible), with details re logistics
etc. to be worked out, or here. The drug regimen will be different from the last time, and
apparently I won't lose my hair (ok, I guess I can go get my hair colored now). I really
don't know more about that regimen yet (ie length, side effects etc.) as I'll await the next
round of test results and ""confirmatory"" news.
I told Dr. Beavis that it seemed to me the cancer had recurred relatively soon: I've been
NED since last November, ie 6 months. Apparently, a recurrence after six months is
exactly the tipping point between being ""chemo sensitive"" and ""chemo resistant."" About
50% of women fall on each side.
I also asked her if she thought I could fight this and she said absolutely. If/when I get to
the point where she feels chemo will no longer be effective or recommended, she'll let
me know; but as far as I can tell we're nowhere -- repeat, nowhere -- near there now. She
reminded me (as I reminded myself) that in the best case scenario ovarian cancer is a
chronic disease (and I can live with that, no pun intended). I have the most common
type, high grade serous, but it's an aggressive type and a small part of my particular
cancer is particularly aggressive (carcinoma sarcoma). So, for now, more periods of
treatment alternating with more 'honeymoon periods' are likely in store.
I asked her about staging, ie would I be 'demoted' to a stage IV if the cancer has spread
outside my pelvic cavity. Dr. Beavis told me that with ovarian cancer you never 'budge'
from the stage at which you are diagnosed, in my case IIIC (quite common); you simply
have recurrences.
I felt SO much better after speaking with Dr. Beavis. Not only is she patient, plain-
                       469 / 1.901
speaking, brilliantly skilled, and empathic (while remaining consummately professional).
But by virtue of her devising a solid, logical plan along with Dr. Patel, my State College
oncologist, she has also given me *much more hope* along with utter confidence that
she is 'on it.' Hence, I've been snatched from the morbid place I found myself yesterday
while my body absorbed the contrast liquid I had to drink before the PET scan: I closed
my eyes for an hour and planned the details of my funeral (so at least I can check that
off my 'to do' list - a bit of gallows humor there :)) as well as last missives and adieux to
friends and family. Today I'm back to working, trying out all my new Clinique makeup,
fixing a batch of rhubarb compote, planning to buy a new couch etc. Physically, I really
don't feel badly at all. And mentally/emotionally, I'm back on track. So please get on that
track with me, and not on the pitying/fearful track. Cancer can be scary, especially when
observed from the outside I imagine, but once you're 'in it' it simply becomes woven into
your the warp and woof of your life.
At the same time, I don't deny that, objectively, this whole cancer situation sucks big
time. And that I'd rather be in Paris.
Speaking of tracks, I'll be walking the track at the Military Museum in Boalsburg this
Sunday with at least part of team #willapower (now fourteen strong and growing). I'm so
delighted to have thus far raised over 5K to help women like myself (and the
phenomenal doctors and staff and Johns Hopkins) and so humbled by the generosity of
family, friends from grade school, college, grad school, colleagues, former graduate and
undergraduate students (child cancer survivors among them), fellow 'teal sisters' (other
OC survivors), State College friends and others who have so generously contributed. It's
not too late to join/donate (see details in a previous post).",4,neutral,0.48531705,0.034580592,0.07834786,0.15034467,0.020534994,0.48531705,0.022432562,0.20844224
132,"Here's the medical update: I'm having an MRI on Friday and will have a stool sample
collected by mid-week to help Drs. Beavis and Patel confirm or not the diagnosis of a
recurrence of my ovarian cancer. Tomorrow I have an appointment with Dr. Patel (and
port clean), which just happens to be my regularly scheduled, every three month
'surveillance' appointment. I have a list of questions for him, including: What is
preventing him and Dr. Beavis from confirming their suspicion of a recurrence at
present? What are they on the lookout for? If more chemo is in store, what are the
potential side effects of the drugs I'll be receiving?
And the thing of it all is that I feel fine. I have some lingering discomfort on my right side
and my bowels continue to be 'messed up,' which may signal the presence of some
bacteria (this will be tested). But otherwise, I feel well, physically and mentally (I
continue to worship at the altar of Lexapro). I've been dressing cute, brightening my face
                       472 / 1.901
with the Clinique gelee, chubby stick for cheeks and Sangria lip gloss, and have my first
mani-pedi in ages booked for next week. Unfortunately, though, cancer couldn't give a
hoot about such efforts. :( And oh my goodness chemo is debilitating. I am apprehensive
as hell about being 'felled' once again by the chemo drugs, although I did bounce back.
Why was yesterday's Stride and Thrive event one of the best days I've had in a long
time, maybe (is this too hyperbolic?) in my life?
1)I raised over $7K to help fund research, fellowships, and followup treatment for 'below
the belt' cancer patients and survivors treated at Hopkins. And that feels fantastic.
2)Over 90 of my friends and family members contributed to my fundraising efforts. I am
overwhelmed by the outpouring of generosity not just from those I would expect to
contribute but also from many of my former and current graduate students,
undergraduate students (some of whom wrote touching notes and tributes), friends of
Ben's and their parents, and an adored 'benefactress.' The effort also brought together a
beautiful chorus of names and faces from all the 'eras' of my life: grade/high school;
Harvard (college); NYU (grad school); Penn State/State College; others. Former grad
students ran for me in Michigan and North Carolina and Philly; dear college friends
dedicated their runs to me in New Hampshire and Baltimore and Tokyo, while a grad
school bestie and my dear PSU department colleagues also walked in my honor (and
sent pics!); my brother and family, meanwhile, bedecked themselves in #willapower
'gear' (swag? I guess I'm a brand now...) for their walk in Riverside Park. There is good in
the world! I know (I just changed this from: ""I have to imagine..."" No. I *know*) that all
these dear folks care about me and/or care about combating cancer. And that feels
fantastic.
3) I am grateful that I still have the 'stuff,' ie the organizational chops, motivating force
(ie #willapower), creativity (#willapower t-shirts!), energy, commitment, and
purposefulness to pull something like this off. Our team came in sixth in fundraising
efforts out of forty teams. And we won the spirit award from the organizers (always the
'model student,' no surprise I'm gunning for being the model cancer survivor/fundraiser
:) )
4) A gorgeous day; a great group of local women including two of my dear ""teal
sisters""/'IIICs' (I was delighted to introduce each of them to one another, w/one result
being that we may now be morphing into a social walking group, at the suggestion of
one of my friends); an invigorating walk around the pretty grounds of the Military
Museum in Boalsburg; a fit, smiling and kind group of five young adults (including Ben,
Alex and Nikhil, buddies since kindergarten - a precious scene beholding these strapping
young men of 25 along with their wonderful girlfriends Sammi and Julia), setting off to
run a 5K along a route Ben had devised; a post-walk/run coffee in the sun at the Pump
Station Cafe and relaxed lingering on this glorious Sunday morning. The fun and
                       473 / 1.901
fellowship and good vibes felt strong enough to elbow out a deadly disease, at least for a
bit. And that felt fantastic.
5)A community of survivors and caregivers emerging throughout the day from the
livestreamed opening and closing ceremonies in Baltimore (the event was virtual this
year) and from a steady stream of photos and videos posted on social media. Dozens of
survivors, each with her own journey. Several women 'liked' my FB/Instagram posts, a
few 'friended' me. I am one of them, I am not alone, and it felt empowering. As I said to
my friends in State College when we split up after our time together: ""Next year in
Baltimore."" And THAT felt fantastic. Please join me then!

133,"As several friends have reached out to me with much caring for an update following my
visit with Dr. Patel yesterday, here's a brief one for now: we had a good visit in that he
spent quite a bit of time with me and seemed completely on top of how everything has
evolved in the past few months. We also had a very candid conversation about how I
might approach work-life balance and, in that context, quality of life issues going
forward, which I very much appreciated.
He admitted he was 'confounded' by the abnormal liver function numbers (but guess
what folks? I had more blood taken yesterday and now my liver numbers are completely
                       479 / 1.901
normal, an encouraging sign). [Btw, the other recent 'better news' that I forgot to
mention in a recent post is that the partial blockage of my small intestine, which was
causing me belly aches, has resolved. A few days on a liquid diet did the trick].
Dr. Patel feels that I am headed towards more treatment, given the corroborating
evidence from the bloodwork (CA125 number has doubled) and imaging (CT and PET
scans). I'm not sure whether it was Dr. Beavis who pushed for another round of imaging
[mistakenly wrote 'imagining' - ha] (ie MRI), but in any event it will allow the doctors to
take a closer look at what's going on inside my pelvic cavity. It is not clear where exactly
the cancer on my right side might be (muscle? on the liver? lymph node? duct?). The MRI
imaging might provide a clearer idea.
If I have more chemo it will take place once a month, for an unspecified duration,
combined with regular testing of my blood (and maybe scans?) to assess the
effectiveness of the treatment. The drug regimen is carboplatin (which I took last time)
and doxil (which I didn't). Dr. Patel seemed to feel the side effects would not be too bad,
but I'll reserve judgment for now and think positive. One effect might be 'hand-foot
syndrome' (some sort of rash on hands and feet). Another might be cardiotoxicity
((in)ability of heart to pump blood well and/or damage to heart muscle); this is what I
need to know more about, because it sounds worrisome. I hope he didn't gloss over this
risk... He sent me off to have an echocardiogram (like a sonogram of my heart), to make
sure, I guess, that my heart is functioning well, which it is (and may it continue to).
Chemo could start next week. Whatever they are detecting has been caught early. There
are no big masses or anything like that.
While I'm nervous about the side effect I just mentioned, I am currently feeling *fine*
(well, in fact). After a two-day freak out I described in a previous post, I am feeling strong
and resolute, mainly after convos w/some key players (Dr. Beavis, my fellow survivor
friends, family). I was told to expect a recurrence from day 1, and at least one of my
survivor friends here in State College is doing well twelve years out after at least four
recurrences.
Onwards to definitive (?) confirmation of a recurrence once my oncologists will have read
my MRI results, probably Friday or Monday. If their read is, once more, not definitive, Dr.
Beavis suggested we'd do another CT-scan in six weeks. 
I realize that it's been over a year since I began writing this journal. In a future post I
hope to write about that fact, including my thoughts on what kind of 'narrative structure'
I could ever hope to impose on -- or see emerge from -- the events of the past year
(Bildungsroman? Picaresque novel? Odyssey?). For now, all that's coming to me is: it's
been one big, dizzying SWIRL.

                       482 / 1.901
Well, the MRI, as not unexpected, confirmed a recurrence. I could tell that Dr. Beavis was
waiting a bit to let that news sink in before we continued the rest of our 45 minute
teleconference yesterday. As always, she was *perfect* - calm, clear in her explanations,
patient, caring. She said my bright purple turban looked great on me (it's hiding a mop of
unruly gray hair that will be 'tamed' next week). She explained that the MRI picked up
3-4 small (1 cm or less) 'implants' on (not in, which is good) my colon. There may well be
other, microscopic bits of cancer in other areas (like on my side, near my liver) but the
MRI did not pick them up and the upcoming chemo will target them too. The colon is a
typical place for a recurrence of ovarian cancer. As I likely explained when I dealt with
'first line' chemo, something that might be compared to 'dandelion fluff' blew off the
cancerous ovaries (now removed, of course) and landed on other nearby areas of my
pelvic and abdominal cavities. That is why I had to have a small piece of my liver
removed during my ginormous debulking surgery last May. And please remember,
everyone, what I've written several times: OC is, in Dr. Beavis' words, a ""chronic
relapsing condition."" A recurrence was always expected, although I'm still a bit surprised
it showed up so soon. I asked Dr. Beavis if that is an indicator for future recurrences and
she said that usually *less* time elapses between successive  recurrences. However, she
is not at all certain this will be my case because I had several complicating factors --
infection, fistula -- during the first go-around. She suspects that the cancer on the colon
*may* be related to some of my current digestive/bowel troubles. The fact that the
implants/tumors are small is good; chemo tends to be more effective on a number of
small amounts of cancer in one location as opposed to bigger masses in several places.
It is also good that no cancer was detected in or near my lungs, which would mean that
the cancer had traveled through the blood stream, which would be (really) not good.
Equally bad, I think, would be cancer found to have penetrated inside organs.
Nevertheless, the thought of insidious, stealthy cancer cells attacking me from within is
scary indeed.
More chemo is in my near future. I'll have six rounds, one every four weeks, with a CT
scan after rounds three and six and my CA125 number tested every round. I am likely
not eligible for the clinical trial at Hopkins that Dr. Beavis had mentioned. The drug
regimen I'll receive will consist of carboplatin and doxil. Dr. Beavis says that most people
tolerate a second round better (each session will also be shorter than the last time, when
chemo was almost a full-day activity). I might develop a rash on my feet and hands, I
might possibly develop an allergy to the drugs, and I have a *1%* chance of developing
a heart problem. Apparently my hair won't fall out. As for nausea, vomiting, fatigue - who
knows? I'll take all of it *as long as the drugs are effective,* which is my foremost wish.
Unfortunately, no one can be with me in the chemo room, due to COVID. That's a
bummer for sure, but it's ok too.
We talked a good bit about work. As I currently have no idea of how this round of
                       483 / 1.901
treatment will affect me, it's hard to make decisions and plans. However, with the help of
colleagues I'm trying to figure out some contingency plans that will allow me to acquit
my responsibilities and do the work I enjoy doing while having firm backup plans in
place. And it seems even more imperative to me than before that I'll likely need to work
from home, to protect myself from a potential chemo/Covid whammy. Penn State's plans
for reopening are complicated, but I presume they will include provisions for people with
underlying/complicating conditions.
So now I have to wait for my insurance company to pre-certify my treatment. Dr. Patel's
nurse said this could take 7-10 days! Aargh! And I need to meet with Dr. Patel
beforehand to further discuss the treatment and its potential side effects. So this delay
likely suits my approach/avoidance m.o., but the 'approach' side of my brain tells me
that we need to get this show on the road. 'Onwards,' as I said to Dr. Beavis yesterday --
with a sigh.
...and did I mention that I feel and look FINE?
After I spoke w/Dr. Beavis, I went out for a walk to process the news. As I passed my
favorite, just-blooming gingko tree I found myself blurting out loud, to no one in
particular: ""My world is shrinking!"" The daughter of one of my best friends in France is
getting married in Burgundy on 2 August. I'd love to go, but Americans may not even be
allowed into France before mid-July and then will likely have to quarantine. And now
there is my vulnerable immune system to consider. So that part of my 'world' that is in
France -- a big part, in fact -- seems more and more like a mirage. I very much want to
get away for a few days before school starts, w/a strong preference for a place I can plop
myself down on the beach w/a few novels. ""See how you're feeling after a few rounds,""
said Dr. Beavis. ""So....much....uncertainty...,"" I said to her, sighing (again). ""I really wish I
could provide more certainty,"" she replied, empathically. ""But unfortunately I can't.""
As usually happens, I'm feeling more chipper today, having slept better last night than
the one before. I had a very productive work day, making good progress on both my
Vever editing and an article (about food, of all things...). Went to farmers market
(rhubarb, strawberries, zucchini, melon) and will make something tasty for dessert
tomorrow at a friend's house. I took a peaceful drive out into the countryside on Sunday
in my new car (moon roof open all the way; soul music on Sirius); so gorgeous here in
June (see pic). Amish kids were having fun on their kick scooters while the older ones
were taking their buggies out for a spin.
Thanks for your dms, texts, emails and calls of concern. Thank you for walking with me
on this challenging road. Grateful that Ben and Sammi will be here for two (?) more
months (!) before moving to NY.  So grateful for my support network. I will continue to
lean into it.

Just a quick update as I get a relaxing pedicure (finally!): I’m starting chemo again
tomorrow morning at 9:45. Healing energy, positive thoughts, prayers all welcome.
Photo of my wonderful friend Helen looking glam at dinner in her backyard last night with
her husband and three of her kids, Ben, Sammi and myself. So pleasant to break bread
together. I made the strawberry shortcake bc you can’t not eat succulent local
strawberries in June. Tonight I’m making a veggie meal - zucchini pies (recipe from
Madhur Jaffrey’s world vegetarian cookbook that my dear friend Vinni sent me), beet and
goat cheese salad, tomato salad. Cooking is so much more interesting than chemo.

136,"Another brief update: I didn't have chemo today. I arrived promptly at 9:45 mentally and
physically prepared, lunch in one tote bag, other supplies (hand cream, ear buds, book,
stationery for thank you notes, ratty pink PSU hoodie I always wear during chemo) in a
second. I had blood drawn and saw the nurse to check vitals. Unfortunately, though,
when I then met Dr. Patel, I balked at the fact that he had not resolved with Dr. Beavis
whether or not I should receive Neulasta (white blood cell booster) after my treatment,
as I had after my previous treatment, which began last summer. He had said previously
that I would not (it turns out that Neulasta is not always used with this particular drug
regimen), yet I was fairly certain Dr. Beavis had recommended it (indeed she had, in this
case, because of COVID). And *I had written to both of them beforehand, asking them to
please resolve the issue between themselves before my first treatment.* They had not
done this. And my additional 'read' on the situation was that Dr. Patel didn't want to get
into the weeds with my insurance company over whether or not the Neulasta would be
covered. So he hadn't contacted Aetna. And he didn't seem to me to have a solid
contingency plan in the event that my infection-fighting white blood cells dropped
significantly after treatment. As I was getting a bit agitated, he finally said ""Let's play it
safe"" (thank you.....) by (his) requesting precertification for Neulasta from Aetna. But this
means waiting until early next week for chemo to start. 
Dr. Patel's office manager apologized to me for not having had this resolved before
today.
....and did I mention that a woman in Dr. Patel's waiting room was hacking away with a
deep chest cough? I noted her mask, but was still imagining those droplets spraying out
from under and over it. Grrr!
Will hope to salvage the afternoon and get back on track w/this change of plans.

approved for coverage by Aetna (at one point they misfiled my paperwork - don't ask...);
that my surgical and my medical oncologists were on the same page; and that I could
move an important appointment on Friday to next week, I *finally* got my chemo

have to send any more messages to my doctors and their staff to get us over the hump
and am eager to get going. I feel fine, am working well, enjoying the sunny yet hot
weather and ready for the next phase. More than anything, I want the chemo drugs to

138,"I made it through round 1, but not without a complication. A piece of good news is that
my blood counts looked fine. One of those troublesome liver marker numbers has come
down into the normal range, the other is a bit elevated still but not far off normal. White
and red blood cell counts, platelet count etc. all look good. Based on that encouraging
report, we were able to proceed to chemo.
Since my last stint in the chemo room (July-Nov. 2019), now due to COVID, no visitors,
hand-holders or milkshake-bringers are allowed in. It's very quiet in there. It feels a bit
lonely w/out the company, but I managed (wrote thank you notes, sent texts) and the
entire treatment is shorter this time (2 hours total, but actually about an hour longer if
you count the blood work and then waiting for the results). I know the nurses by now,
and some of them are really nice, caring. And thankfully there were no vociferous
Trumpiacs or other trouble-makers to contend with.
1/2 hour of fluids (glucose solution) - check. 1/2 hour of carboplatin - smooth sailing. 1
hour of doxil (the new drug for me) - about 5 minutes into it I began to feel distinctly
unwell. Flushed, light headed, my chest started constricting and I began to feel searing
pain in my back, seemingly along the sides of my spinal cord. I believe the nurse was
right next to me (frankly, I don't recall) but I managed to mumble something like ""I...
don't...feel... well"" and just remember blurting out a string of epithets to deal w/the
increasing pain. Luckily, the nurses sprung right into action with the emergency protocol,
testing my bp and oxygen (both plummeting rapidly), pumping me with steroids and
benadryl, and letting me know that what they were doing would reverse the allergic
reaction. Dr. Patel also rushed in immediately and began checking my pulse, heart rate,
lungs etc. Fortunately, they were able to get the reaction under control pretty quickly, at
which point I was sort of loopy from the meds. We waited about 25 mn. then restarted
the doxil, this time with no complication for the rest of the hour. It was quite scary, but
the anti-allergy meds kicked in so quickly and almost knocked me out completely so my
fright response was quickly tempered. And the nurses were on it, thankfully; if not, it
could have been much worse. I suppose I'll have to receive those meds now every time. I
had been told that an allergic reaction was possible but it apparently doesn't happen
that often with doxil. Again, my bottom line is: may the chemo work! (May the force be
with me, in other words!).
I was so zonked when I got home around 5 p.m. (my neighbor Janis kindly took me to
and from, with a pit stop at Meyers dairy afterwards for the now ritual during or post-
chemo milkshake) that I slept for an hour or so, then heated up some tomato basil orzo
                       494 / 1.901
soup (courtesy of Wegman's) and crashed in front of the tv, where I've become
engrossed in the Israeli series (on Netflix), Shtisel. Between watching the tube longer
than I should have, some additional screen time, getting involved in a lighthearted text
exchange with a friend, and still being somewhat agitated from the day's events - and
despite having all that Benadryl in me -- I had much trouble sleeping and only squeezed
in a few hours. Will try to correct that tonight with an earlier bedtime and less screen
time.My wonderful friend Helen brought me not only a delicious lunch (chicken salad
bowl - lots of good protein) but also a ""Nourishing and Brightening Oil Sheet Mask""
(100% Camellia), which seems exactly what's needed tonight.
I feel tired today and mildly nauseous (am taking anti-nausea meds) but not too bad
really, all things considered. I've had a relaxing day writing thank you notes (close to 100
donors to my cancer fundraiser, so it's taking a while but I'm getting there!) and
responding to emails. So far I'm not feeling anything like the crushing fatigue that I had
last time around. Ditto for any of the ghastly doxil-related symptoms (skin turning brown,
mouth sores etc.) that women write about on a Facebook page that seems to trade in
catastrophizing and hysteria (and misspellings) so I try to stay off it, even though there
are kernels of helpful info mixed in. Much more useful to me are the carefully curated
postings of the Hopkins' Kelly Gyneologic Oncology Service, where I am grateful to be a
patient.
Off now to get a shot of udenyca, a Neulasta biosimilar that will help boost my white
blood cell count. This is the shot that I nearly had to sell my firstborn for in order to have
my insurance company cover, so it better work!

139,"I understand that my post-chemo pattern now will likely entail a rough weekend followed
by gradual recovery, unless the rounds become increasingly hard for me to handle (last
time, in July-Nov., some rounds seemed to hit me harder than others). On the whole,
though - and for the time being - this go-around does not seem as debilitating as the last
one. So far, no crushing fatigue, no seventeen-hour sleeps, no needing to lie down every
time I pass my bed. The day after chemo I took it easy, but had no problem showering
and getting dressed, making breakfast, shooting off a bunch of emails and staying up
until my normal bedtime these days of about 10 p.m. Ditto for the following days - over
the weekend, I shopped at the farmers market, took a long country drive, went clothes
shopping, whipped up a beet and goat cheese salad and some garlic scape pesto etc.
And today I had a pretty much normal work day, making some progress on two projects,
attending to correspondence etc.

as I did in January, resulting in a broken bone in my ankle. And last night I noticed that
one of my big toenails appeared to be 'jiggling' a bit, loosely. Then I remembered that
chemo can adversely affect finger and toe nails (I wrote Dr. Patel's nurse to see what she
recommends but have not heard back yet; of course I fear infection if the tissue becomes
exposed). I also remembered all the awful, undignified, sci-fi-ish side effects that chemo
can provoke. Losing my hair was of course the one that most made me feel like some
sort of alien; whether or not it will happen this time is unclear. Thinking positively, I have
an appointment with my hair stylist Sarah tomorrow for the first time in almost four
months! I cannot wait. My hair has grown in curly so we'll see what she can help me
                       497 / 1.901
come up with.
My mood has been generally ok, not super-buoyant but fine, with some teary moments
usually late at night, first thing in the morning or in the shower. I was veering towards
self-pity (never a constructive emotion for me), imagining that people were starting to
think of me as ""doomed girl"" (aka ""recurrence girl"") or, conversely, ""heroic girl"" (an
equally pressured role to fill). I got out from under that cloud pretty quickly, somehow.
As ever, texts, msgs and emails from friends and family help immensely, even if I can't
*see* most of these folks (very hard, more on that another time). My OC-survivor friend
Deb reminded me in a msg today that treatment for her several recurrences (and
zapping the cancer early each time) has given her twelve years of good quality of life so
far. Hopefully, I'll be able to get out for a socially distanced walk or coffee with a friend or
two this week, and there's a nice lunch on the horizon too. And Ben and Sammi are back
from D.C., having completed Phase 1 (getting their stuff out of their D.C. apartments) of
their move to NY in August. They are quarantining for a few days at Michael and Sue's,
and took a COVID test as well, simply as a precaution because they've been away from
State College for a while. I expect they are fine, but it will be a few more days until they
can stay here. We're already, though, formulating some holiday weekend plans to get
out to one of the pretty state parks nearby for some kayaking or canoeing, picnicking
etc. I would love to eat a grilled hot dog.
On Wednesday I'll be (re)passed the baton for the department headship. Obviously we're
at a critical juncture right now working to help implement Penn State's plan for
reopening in August. I'll be working from home and will have backup on hand from
trusted colleagues if needed.

140,"I haven't written in a while. That is both because all is well for now and because I've
been very busy with headship business -- in particular, making sure all of our
international students can remain in the States following the very draconian and
inhumane directive from ICE targeting them. It feels good to be busy, useful, helpful. I'm
                       499 / 1.901
cautiously optimistic that I made the right decision returning to the headship -- as long
as my health remains stable. Right now, I feel pretty well overall. My energy is good, my
appetite healthy, I'm sleeping well on the whole and I think I look ok. The week after
chemo, I didn't feel great but in the three weeks after that I really rebounded
impressively. My stomach and digestive system have a mind (and nervous system) of
their own and always seem to be a bit 'off.' I guess that's what happens when you say
goodbye to two parts of your colon and two of your small intestine.
I feel so well, in fact, that on Wednesday, rather spontaneously, I'm going on vacation! I
have not been out of Dodge, except for treatment (read: surgery) at Hopkins since
December, when I was in NY and on a wonderful retreat with three of my best women
friends at Kripalu Yoga Center in the Berkshires. I'm heading back to MA, this time to the
Cape! I have been craving the ocean (seeing it, bathing in it, maybe doing some yoga by
it, reading something engrossing with my toes dipped in the water etc.). One of my best
travel buddies, Ben, enthusiastically agreed to come with me. We took him to the Cape
when he was little, but he doesn't remember it. We're staying in a wonderful hotel with
lots of amenities, the Chatham Bars Inn, which I fell in love with ten years ago during a
fun stay at the home of a college friend in Chatham. My friend Denise and I took a walk
around the property at that time and sat on some comfy lawn chairs out front. The hotel
has a private beach, a pool, several restaurants, fitness center, and spa (have already
booked a facial and manicure). I'm hoping for lots of beach and pool time, some drives to
nearby towns, walks and lots of reading (I have two books lined up and am trying to
settle on a few others), plus some yummy seafood. I will be careful, but my stomach
tolerates fish quite well, and I don't see how a lobster roll - or two - could do harm - just
need to avoid fried and/or spicy stuff and alcohol (does not mix well w/my chemo) - well,
maybe just one fried clam will be ok.
Any suggestions for a book on tape and/or good podcast for the long drive there and
back, which Ben and I will split? 
Otherwise, the summer days have proceeded tranquilly (well, except for the continually
worrisome backdrop of COVID and national politics; still we live in a peaceful little bubble
here). I've been working hard, doing a lot of cooking and baking, getting out for walks,
watching Netflix, reading, seeing a few friends here and there and keeping in touch with
many others. I fully realize that all of this could turn on a dime, though -- I could have a
bad reaction to my next chemo or, worse, the chemo might turn out not to be effective
(a scan in about two months, plus bloodwork before that should reveal any telltale
signs). It is possible, then, that while I calmly go about my business cancer cells might be
continuing to multiply and spread. So...much...uncertainty. But my default mode is
positive thinking and savoring the moment or, as my friend David Rothman (who knows
of what he speaks...) puts it, squeezing each drop of sweetness out of every moment as
if it were a cell of honeycomb.
                       500 / 1.901
Sammi and Ben found a rental apartment in Park Slope and will be moving in mid-
August. I will miss those two tremendously, but it's time for them to get on with the next
phase of their lives. Ben may, in the end, wind up taking all his courses at NYU online
and Sammi will continue to work remotely, but at least they'll be 'launched.' Nice that
the whole immediate family will be in NY. I'm missing the city, but I suspect that the vibe
might seem unfamiliar these days...
As it was my father's yahrzeit last Friday (three years), I virtually attended service so I
could say kaddish. The rabbi offered a somewhat differently worded version of the
prayer for healing than the one I'm used to, and it resonated with me. The prayer invited
""healing, strength and enlivening"" to *surge* (apt verb) both ""towards and within me,""
investing me with ""spirit, holiness and continuing possibilities."" I think we also sang the
Debbie Friedman version of the ""Mi Shebeirach"" (prayer for healing) that asks a higher
power to ""help us find the *courage* to make our lives a blessing."" Sometimes it does
indeed take *courage* to make our lives a blessing; one cannot be passive about this
endeavor - at least not in my experience.

141,"I would like to share a bit about our wonderful week on Cape Cod, but thought it best to
first share a health update. We arrived home (after a nine-hour trip from MA, with Ben
doing perhaps 2/3 of the driving and me 1/3) late Tuesday night and I was at Dr. Patel's
office for chemo the next morning (fortunately having benefited from a good night's
sleep, as I was exhausted on our return).
Per the normal routine, I had my blood work done first, to make sure that none of the
results would prevent me from receiving chemo. My hemoglobin was a bit low (expected)
and my liver markers still a bit elevated (their erratic nature is still an unresolved
mystery to me), but not enough to warrant holding off on chemo. The CA125 (OC
marker) result usually comes in the next morning. My vitals were all fine; I seem to have
gained a few pounds, had to be those lobster rolls...
I had a good meeting with Dr. Patel and feel closer to him now than initially. I sense a
genuine concern on his part and feel that he is finally 'seeing' me as the total person I
am. He seemed quite on top of my treatment, and said he felt I was ""doing well,""
perhaps in part because I am so active and have not recently (or ever, really)
experienced any worrisome symptoms like vomiting, blood in stool, headaches, falls etc.
My stomach remains a bit quirky but may have settled down a bit recently. It feels 'stiff'
in the morning (likely due to adhesions), but after I move around a bit it feels more
supple.
I was of course concerned that I might have another allergic reaction to the chemo
drugs, as I did last time, but the nurse pumped me full of Benadryl ahead of the
treatment and I was fine. My nurse, who came over (temporarily or permanently) from a
Geisinger center in Lewistown, seemed to be having lots of trouble with the equipment --
or perhaps the equipment was simply faulty (or perhaps she was a bit faulty...). Every
5-10 minutes or so it would start beeping and she had to restart it, perhaps because of
air bubbles in the tubing through which I receive the chemo drugs. Then she knocked
over a very large tray of medical equipment that clattered noisily to the floor. This really
started stressing me out and added a lot of extra time to the treatment. Oh well.
Nevertheless, I got through it and my friend Helen kindly picked me up, with the now
traditional vanilla milkshake from Meyer Dairy in hand. My caring neighbor Janis had
driven me to chemo in the morning.
Unfortunately, I slept poorly last night: a bout of nausea woke me up at one point and I
was fretting over my soon to be revealed CA125 number, which I'm always highly
                       504 / 1.901
anxious about uncovering (either through Geisinger's online portal or via Dr. Patel). So I
was immensely relieved to learn (via the portal) that my CA number had decreased from
50 last time to 31.2 this time, putting me back within normal range (at the somewhat
higher end of normal, but definitely *normal*). Dr. Patel wrote me to say that this
gradual trending down was encouraging. It makes me hopeful that my treatment is
working, which is my bottom line hope. I'll know more when I have my CT-scan at the
midway point after round three, in late August.
Today I returned to Dr. Patel's office for my shot of Udenyca (a Neulasta biosimilar),
which boosts white blood cell count. I don't mean to complain, but the (same) nurse did
not inspire confidence. She could not pronounce the name of the medication, making me
unsure if I was receiving the same medication as last time. She had me look at her
computer screen to see if I could pronounce it. And once again she seemed not to be
able to operate the equipment, this time to take my blood pressure. Like yesterday, she
was stressing about this (getting flustered and sighing heavily) and that was in turn
making me nervous. I will follow up with the nurse manager to let her know that since I
feel so vulnerable before and during treatment, it's crucial for me that the staff remain
calm, composed, skillful and confident. The Udenyca can cause bone pain, so soon I will
take a Claritin, which can help counteract that potential side effect.
Today I feel tired (from the treatment itself and the poor sleep following) and very mildly
nauseous, but am thankful not yet to have experienced any other pernicious side effects
of Carboplatin and Doxil: bad rash on hands and feet, mouth sores, a worsening of
neuropathy (fairly bad in my toes already), and in rare cases, heart problems. Despite
my fatigue, I had the stamina to spend the day responding to and writing emails that had
piled up during my vacation -- during which I made the decision to keep work at bay to
the extent possible so that I could recharge for a week.
My latest Netflix obsession is a documentary series called ""Lenox Hill,"" which follows the
lives of several doctors at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. It is very sensitively done, and
the stories are compelling. One of the doctors is an experienced neurosurgeon, Mitch,
who in the course of the series is diagnosed, ironically, with advanced neck cancer, ie a
type of cancer familiar to him from his specialty. Aside from not sharing an iota of this
doctor's professional expertise, I found myself relating to him intensely on a personal
level, from his telling his associates, when he reveals his sobering diagnosis to them,
that he doesn't want a 'pity party' or even sympathy, to a poignant scene where he
attends an annual retreat with the other neurosurgeons (about five of them, all men), at
the weekend home of one of the doctors (looked perhaps to be on the Long Island
shore). The guys sit around drinking, casually dressed, fishing poles and tackle scattered
about -- the bond and the love among them is palpable, as is their desire to marshal all
their expertise to help their colleague (who in the end may not want treatment because
it would likely involve removing part of his *face* traversed by a major vein). In any
event, surrounded by his friends/colleagues, Mitch is clearly in the 'be in the moment,
                       505 / 1.901
live every day to the fullest' mode, and says something like ""and this day has been 
great."" I found myself fist-pumping the air and just yelling: ""YES!"" It's amazing how low
my threshold for happiness is these days. Any day that I wake up alive, feeling
reasonably well, and able to work and pursue most of my normal activities, I am simply
ecstatic.
More on the vacay when I'm able. Thanks to many friends who remembered I had chemo
today (I don't even remember sharing the day with many of you!) and checked in w/me
via message or text. I am so touched. I appreciate your care. It uplifts me.",2,fear,0.54079014,0.012876256,0.011926353,0.54079014,0.018307839,0.33020905,0.05890799,0.026982427

Sometimes things get worse before they get better. After two post-chemo days
(Thursday/Friday) feeling relatively chipper -- I put in a good eight-hour work day on
Friday, including attending a tense department heads'/deans' meeting devoted to plans
for Penn State's reopening next month -- the weekend's been rough. In a ""déjà vu all
over again"" scenario reminiscent of last summer (and not in a good way), I fell asleep for
several hours on the couch in the late afternoon two days in a row, awaking at 8:30 p.m.
(and I'm not a napper....). I still felt tired after a ten-hour sleep last night and thus ceded
to the temptation to get back into bed to snooze some more after late breakfast. The
familiar fatigue-nausea combo has beset me, accompanied by an upset stomach, loss of
appetite, some tenderness in my neck etc. UGH. My physical weakness tends in turn to
frustrate and depress me (that niggling feeling that I should be up and about, or working,
or simply doing something compounded with missing friends and family not in State
College when I'm feeling low). As I've found from previous experience, though, in the end
I simply need to give in to the fatigue. I am taking anti-nausea meds, meds for my upset
stomach, Claritin for potential bone pain, and a Tylenol here and there for headache --
and I'm trying to stay well hydrated. Ben and Sammi were kind enough to grocery shop
for me and water my plants. And a gorgeous bouquet from my mother's best childhood
friend and her son, plus another lovely bouquet that Ben and Sammi brought back from
a friend's garden in Pittsburgh, were well timed to lift my spirits. Ditto for a few
messages exchanged with friends, always part of the cure. Hoping that I'll start
rebounding soon. 
Hard to imagine that I felt so energetic during our vacation on Cape Cod, including the
nine-hour drive to and from. That gives me hope. It was a memorable, relaxing, lovely
week at the Chatham Bars Inn- just perfect. Weather was a bit mixed. Surrounded by
magnificent hydrangeas and lulled by a gentle, fragrant sea breeze, we spent entire days
at the pool (where I dug into a few fun reads, _French like Moi,_ by a colleague, Scott
Carpenter, and _L'Appart_ by one of my fave American French food gurus, David
Leibovitz); indulged in the great seafood purveyed by casual shacks along the coast
(fried clam bellies! clam chowder! lobster roll! fish tacos! oysters! fish sandwiches!);
walked to the sweet town of Chatham for a blueberry muffin, juice and coffee each
morning; took a day trip to Provincetown. Ben golfed (including with one of his best buds
from State College, who now lives in Boston, and his girlfriend) while I swam in the spa's
private pool, followed by a facial one day and a manicure the other (three different hand
treatments!). Our room was spacious with high-grade bed linens, a lovely view of the golf
course etc. It was all very much an indulgence in terms of how I usually travel, but as it's
ostensibly my only vacation this summer I decided to splurge. And I'm definitely in that
carpe diem mode. I had a great, totally sympatico time with one of my favorite travel
companions, and we had a belly laugh watching seagulls swooping down to devour the
expensive poolside lunch just bought by a couple sitting next to us.
                       508 / 1.901
[Btw, the hotel was quite COVID-safe -- as safe as one can be these days, I imagine --
and everyone seemed to be adhering to regulations about masking and distancing. While
we did take off our masks at the pool and when dining outdoors, we seem to have
returned healthy. I certainly hope so].
As I had the luxury of some unstructured time to allow my mind to wander ""where it will
go,"" I found myself trying to figure out what constitutes a perfect day for me (I even
brought this up to Ben, but as he's sometimes a man of few[er] words his answer was
succinct: golf). I settled on the following: my perfect day involves an out of the ordinary
space-time continuum. Time is 'elastic' and just flows. There is usually some movement
through space (ie a long walk or several activities in a day that seem to flow naturally
from one into another). There's always at least one other person involved, perhaps a
dear friend. And nature and the weather cooperate. One example would be the very long
walk I have taken for many years on arriving in Paris during the summer -- most often
with my dear grad school friend Randy, but it could also be with my equally dear college
friend Mitchel (or both of them - or any number of friends). It's a ritual that has
maintained its spontaneity. We meet up in the Marais for brunch or coffee and then just
take off walking around Paris, stopping perhaps in the Tuileries to sit and chat by a
gorgeous reflecting pond, then checking out a show in a gallery that we come upon, then
it's time for a cold drink or maybe an ice cream or gelato, then more walking (we'll sit in
one of those adorable little parks that dot Paris), talking, sharing, laughing, gossiping,
catching up, people watching, window shopping until all of a sudden the day's coming to
a close and it's time for an apéritif and maybe a falafel before we part ways. What is so
perfect about these perfect days? The flow and the harmony, the feeling of well-being
and happiness. And equally as perfect, as Montaigne famously puts it in his essay, ""De
l'Amitié"" (""On Friendship""), is the following: ""parce que c'était lui, parce que c'était moi""
(""Because it was he*, because it was me""). [*or she - or them].

I suppose I'm motivated to write more than I've been doing recently when I'm in crisis
mode. But happily things have, overall, been good recently (let's leave aside my
consternation over the state of the country - and the world). A few weeks removed from
my last round of chemo and feeling well, I'm trying to squeeze every ounce of time and
energy, for both work and play, out of these 'good' weeks, with round 3 -- debilitating
like all the others, no doubt -- coming into view on August 20th. Work is of course really
heating up with the start of the semester just two+ weeks away. So I'm trying to keep on
top of all the department head, admin work (usually in the mornings), then switch to
some combination of preparing my fall graduate seminar and my own research in the
afternoons. So far, I'm afloat. And feeling productive and useful = feeling upbeat. And
my energy level this week has been good, as I try very hard to get the sleep I need.
Further, I enjoyed three lovely lunches with friends this week (all of them at the Ale
House, where one can dine on a pleasant shaded outdoor deck), and have a visit with a
friend and a morning walk with three other friends to look forward to tomorrow (this new,
welcome 'tradition' grew out of the June 'Stride and Thrive' cancer walk for which I
organized a team; it was so much fun that several of us now meet up once a month for a
walk, gabbing and post-walk refreshments - #willapower t-shirts optional!). I've bought
outdoor chairs, some decorative planters, and a colorful orange, yellow and blue Mexican
oilcloth tablecloth for my little back patio, so for the first time I can really use it for
entertaining.
Ben and Sammi will come over tomorrow and stay until they leave for NY next Saturday.
Ben's just returned from a golf vacation in Michigan with his dad. He will have been here
since March 16th and Sammi since April 4th. Oh I'm going to miss those two... Well,
maybe more on that another day.
Recently, the myth of Sisyphus came to mind in relation to my own condition. I
remember reading the text by Camus in high school French class I believe. We spent
hours in class debating the meaning of it, which seemed so very 'heavy' to my sixteen-
or so-year-old self. While I don't feel at all as if, like Sisyphus, I've been 'punished' by the
gods or any other power (chalk my cancer up to just plain 'ole bad luck, a random
cellular mutation), I can relate to Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the mountain, almost
reaching the top, only to have it come crashing down again. Then I remembered -- and it
resonated with me as I contemplate my own 'Sisyphean' fate -- the final line of Camus'
text, summing up Sisyphus' paradoxical combination of acceptance of his fate and yet
rebellion against it. ""Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux."" Yes, ""one must imagine Sisyphus
happy.""",5,sadness,0.6767032,0.0016968726,0.0016488497,0.0019846652,0.2697109,0.032569345,0.6767032,0.015686119

Ben and Sammi left this morning at 5:30 a.m., after five months here as my 'quarantine
roommates.' I miss them and feel emotionally exhausted today. Their presence was a
blessing and the silver lining in the midst of the COVID gloom, turning our home into a
happy, harmonious cocoon. I will simply miss having them *around:* an early riser, Ben
would always be working in my study when I rolled out of bed around 8:00; he'd come
into the kitchen (where I had transferred my work station) c. 10:00 to make himself
breakfast; we'd often share a quick bite together at lunchtime. Sammi would return from
working at Michael and Sue's around 6:00. I'd start preparing dinner around 7:00 or so,
often with the kids' help (my passion for cooking and baking has been reactivated over
the past five months as I loved cooking for all of us; we'll see what happens going
forward). We'd enjoy a lovely dinnertime together and then Ben and Sammi would
faithfully clear the table, wash the dishes and tidy the kitchen while I crashed in front of
the t.v. or went for a walk. Before 10 Ben would come into the t.v. room to say
goodnight, leaning his head down so I could plant a kiss on its top. It was wonderful too
to spend so much quality time with Sammi, whether around the house, driving out to an
Amish market in the countryside or discussing how to spruce up my t.v. room and back
patio (both of which I made good strides on this summer, thanks to Sammi's sharp
design sense). They were both also great helpers to me, not only keeping the kitchen
neat but lending a hand with grocery shopping, assembling a new t.v. stand, figuring out
which type of new car I should buy, getting me set up with a better internet server,
occasionally preparing me a gin and tonic (I scarcely drink these days), and of course
pitching in when I was wiped out after chemo. [They're] leaving home, bye bye...
I suppose I should have learned by now, from having cancer, that impermanence is a a
fact of life, but having them leave is still hard. Yet I also feel immensely grateful!
After Ben and Sammi left at 5:30 this morning (Ben came into my room to give me a
final hug w/those long strong arms of his), I fell asleep again and had an extremely
involved dream about my college reunion, the details of which I won't recount now. Next
year is slated to be my 40th but it's going to be virtual. I feel sad about this too, because
it's been a huge uplift to reconnect 'in the flesh' with my college classmates at five year
intervals, although I see and/or am in touch with many of them more often.
I slept in, went to the farmers market, and in the afternoon took a relaxing drive out into
the countryside -- buggies, cows, farms, farmstands (where I bought peaches and dill
pickles), rolling hills -- and way too many Trump signs (and a Confederate flag......) for
my taste (I did spot one Biden sign). I love driving my new car while blaring (windows
closed, a/c on) and singing along to my tunes.
Fortunately -- I suppose -- I have plenty of work to keep me busy with school starting the
week after next. I really can't conceive of what it will be like to conduct the entirety of
                       519 / 1.901
my work from home and am apprehensive about getting lonely, or feeling like I'm
drifting away from all the forms of sociability I'm used to etc. I know that I'll need to have
regular get-togethers (walks, outdoor coffees and lunches etc. for as long as the weather
stays nice) with friends to keep myself sane. I am also a bit apprehensive about staying
on top of things work-wise during the 'bad' week following chemo (my next round is this
coming Thursday), but I've been discussing ways of keeping this manageable with
friends and family. I also need to be 'ok' with not giving 120% at least (as I'm used to
doing), if I'm unable to. This is a difficult reality for me to face as I've always been so
driven in terms of work, but there may be days when I simply have to ease up on the gas
pedal. I'm thinking of setting up a meditation area in Ben's bedroom upstairs. On the
other hand, I am glad to be productive, working, helping, connecting, flexing my
creativity (when not mired in administrative minutia). I've been feeling well the past
three weeks or so but with chemo (and then likely a CT scan and possible
echocardiogram) looming, that boulder's likely going to come rolling down that hill again.
I've already tentatively programmed in ample rest next weekend should I need it before
school starts. And I'm of course praying I won't have to deal with any 'curveballs' in
terms of my health. I continue to be very well surrounded -- another blessing. Two
friends checked in on me today, intuiting that I'd be sad after B and S's departure (they
are safely in Brooklyn now, and Ben has scouted out a 'real deal' Brooklyn pizza joint for
their dinner). One friend proposed a walk tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it.

145,"Just a quick update before I go make dinner. Everything went smoothly with today's
treatment. My wonderful friend Helen picked my up bright and early (before 8:00 a.m.)
and it was lovely to be able to enjoy her company for the short drive to the Geisinger
medical facility. We joked that we had both made the effort to put on make up and dress
nicely for each other :). I had blood drawn, which I then reviewed with Dr. Patel. Some
counts were slightly high (liver markers) or low (hemoglobin) but overall things looked ok
and there was nothing so out of range as to delay treatment. Tomorrow I'll learn what
my CA125 number is and pray that it will have decreased even more from 31.2 (normal)
or else will have remained stable; if it went up since last time, I'd feel worried. We looked
at the results of my last PET (I believe) scan (maybe it was a CT scan) and saw the spots
on my liver and in a lymph node that we are targeting during this round of treatment.
That image was a rather sobering reality check and draws me temporarily back into that
dark place where cancer reigns. It was simply an 'UGH' moment. I'll have a PET scan
soon as we're at the halfway mark and it's appropriate to take a look inside and see if
the cancer has regressed (hope so). My vital signs were very good (100% oxygen rate,
good blood pressure on the lower side, weight around 130 lbs, which is a weight that
feels very comfortable and healthy for me). Dr. Patel said: ""You're doing good.""
Treatment went smoothly and took about three hours. The nurse again pumped me up
with Benadryl to prevent another allergic reaction to Doxil; that immediately made me
quite drowsy. Then I received an anti-nausea drug, then Carbo followed by Doxil. Smooth
sailing. I mainly texted friends and family and, as ever, was extremely grateful for check
ins and well wishes (thank you mom, Ethan, Ben, Helen, Jackie, Gay, Maria, Clare -- and if
I've missed anyone please excuse me in my grogginess). My kind neighbor Janis picked
me up and she knew to drive me right to Meyers Dairy for the now ritual post-chemo
milkshake (chocolate toasted almond - so good and refreshing and comforting). I was
very tired when I got home so I crashed (ie slept!) for about two hours, then sat outside
in the delightful 'back to school' weather, then wrote a bunch of work emails. Now I'm
going to make dinner (likely some haddock and zucchini and taboulé. My potassium is
low so I need to stock up on bananas, melon, raisins, etc.
Tomorrow I hope I won't be too tired to make it to my hair stylist's for a 9:30
appointment. Then at 2:00 I have to return to Dr. Patel's for a shot to boost my white
                       524 / 1.901
blood count, after which I'll go down the hall to my dermatologist's to have stitches
removed from my head (she had biopsied tissue from a bump on my head that, as she
suspected, turned out to be benign - whew - from a pilar cyst). Exciting, eh?
The weekend will pose the challenge of needing to rest as much as possible combined
with needing to keep up with admin./head work to the extent possible and polish off my
syllabus and prepare for graduate seminar on the Dreyfus Affair on Tuesday evening (I
feel like the class part is in pretty good shape; almost done w/syllabus, have been
thinking a lot about format of first session and what I want to say). I need to avoid stress
but I'm also happy to feel purposeful and productive. So I'm praying that the chemo
effects aren't too harsh but there's no guarantee. Based on the first two rounds, I can
expect acute fatigue, nausea, body aches, cramps etc. Praying that mouth sores, bad
rash don't kick in. Good wishes, good karma, prayers, mantras all welcome going
forward.",3,joy,0.5151388,0.005344801,0.0067221387,0.025810296,0.5151388,0.28266758,0.13697255,0.027343784
146,"The weekend's been rather rough, as predicted. Saturday morning I woke up with the
now familiar body aches. It seems like every part of my body is sore to the touch, even
my head. My neck, arms, ribs etc. all seem sort of puffy and sensitive and it hurts just to
move. Otherwise, I have some relatively mild nausea and significant fatigue, which I tried
to combat by getting at least nine hours sleep both Saturday and Sunday night and lying
down a few times during the day. Today my body feels no worse (although it doesn't feel
distinctly better either) and I'm hoping tomorrow I might start to turn the corner
(incidentally, I never learned my CA125 number on Friday so I hope -- and don't hope --
that that test result comes in tomorrow). I laid low at home over the weekend, enjoyed a
mocha chip milkshake my friend Jackie was kind enough to bring me, watched Netflix
(_Father Soldier Son,_ a sobering NYTimes documentary), and worked calmly in my
office, which turned out to be fairly relaxing. I had to detach when I began stressing over
a frustrating hour spent trying to scan documents, fruitlessly.
I felt anxious knowing that despite my discomfort I had to try to push through to finish up
my syllabus and prepare a number of admin. tasks for the beginning of this week, as our
semester starts tomorrow. And goodness knows I'm not the best organized nor the most
efficient admin., but I did make an effort to get as far as I could this weekend. This
means that I will have the morning tomorrow to deal with whatever headship stuff might
arise, and then the afternoon to prepare my class for Tuesday evening; I've already
given the first session a good bit of thought, so I just need to sit down and chart it out.
Tuesday morning we have our College heads and deans meeting. I'm still wagering on
the notion that feeling productive and purposeful will actually be good for me, as long as
I stay calm and healthy. Maybe I just want sympathy. We'll see.
I had quite the back to school anxiety dream last night, this one likely compounded by
                       526 / 1.901
the fact that I have in fact been out of the classroom for an entire year, including a
medical leave last fall. In this dream, I had returned to wrap up an undergraduate class
for the last session. I had missed the second to last session without letting the students
know where I was, and apparently in my absence things had gone downhill (in reality, I
*did* miss the second to last session of my undergrad class in Spring 2019, because I
was in Danville meeting with a gynecological oncologist; my wonderful intern took the
class for me that day and I think some of the students were concerned about my sudden
absence). In any event, when I got to the class I felt that I needed to let the students
know where I had been, so in my best 'teacher voice' (ie volume pumped way up), I
explained to them that I had been travelling to Russia, Germany and Iceland. I was sort
of gesturing aimlessly into the air as I was saying this (almost expounding on it) -- but
none of them were listening to me; I was completely irrelevant. The students were slated
to do group presentations that day, so I tried to get that going, knowing that we would
not have time to complete all the presentations and not having really figured out a
solution (perhaps I thought vaguely about having them come do the presentations for
me at another time). We were in some sort of space that gradually became darker and
murky looking, with a strange glow. I could hardly see the students, but they seemed to
be interacting with another. One of the group presentations was about Gyp, the author I
wrote my dissertation about whom I'm also incorporating into my Dreyfus Affair seminar
this fall. It had an almost surreal or fairy tale quality about it, with the strange glowing
light and flashes of gold in whatever space we were in. End of dream.
In this 'plague season,' I've had a number of dreams about travel. Dreams are wishes...
Hoping and expecting a more successful first class than in my dream, I'm taking the
evening off to chill and will get back to work tomorrow.",2,fear,0.67840165,0.0047687013,0.012044972,0.67840165,0.023085834,0.04328792,0.23042864,0.007982296
147,"I can take dozens of emails, a nationwide Zoom crash, and a very full day of work in
stride in light of the good news re my CA125 number today, which has decreased from
50 (before round 1) to 31.2 (round 2) to 19.7 (round 3; ie within normal range, by most
assessments). Dr. Patel notes an ""overall encouraging result."" YAY! I'm hoping this
indicates that my treatment is working, which is my fervent prayer. And the result has
given me a boost at the outset of the semester, just when I need to rally and focus my
energies and concentration.
At the same time, I realize that I'm running a marathon not a sprint, that I'm in it for the
long haul, that technically my disease has no cure but that I might still set my sights on
long-term remission (statistically not likely, although I know several women who have
beaten the odds and thrived), that recurrences are likely yadda yadda yadda. But I will

I haven't written in a while. The first three weeks of school have sped by and I'm caught
up in the frenzied pace. My graduate seminar on the Dreyfus Affair appears to be going
well. I'm certainly enjoying it - and the students -- and feel energized to be teaching
again after a year away from the (now virtual) classroom. While admittedly the first
nearly three-hour session (5:30-8:15 p.m.) drained me physically, last night I still felt
energetic enough afterwards to cook dinner (and then to plunk down in front of the t.v.,
only to watch an utterly saddening Frontline focusing on three children living in poverty
with single mothers, navigating the pandemic, mothers' job losses, and the impact of the
Black Lives Matter movement).
It's a stressful time to be an administrator. The number of COVID-positive cases
continues to rise alarmingly on our campus, which means that colleagues have been
confronted with cases in their own classes, and I need to help our faculty navigate these
crises. I often have to supply data to the College (for example, about the modes --
remote, in person, mixed -- in which our classes will be taught next semester) on very
short notice. Major budget cutbacks are looming, in the Libraries for example, but not
just there. We anticipate a poor academic job market for our graduate students this year.
And campus and town just seem so ..... quiet. Being able to do all my work from home is,
on the one hand, a privilege and time-saver yet it also makes 'community building'
within our department harder, to say the least. At times I feel isolated but otherwise I'm
grateful to be 'in the mix,' 'in the room where it happens' (to quote from _Hamilton_).
And it heartens me to try to be helpful, to work with students and colleagues to help
them achieve goals, to move the department forward, hopefully, even in these stressful,
straitened circumstances. And even while combating cancer. Maybe I'm like Paris,
according to her motto: Fluctuat nec mergitur/She is tossed by the waves, but does not
sink.
I certainly felt tossed by a 'wave' today at 6:20 a.m., when I dragged myself out of bed
the morning after teaching my three-hour seminar (when I usually let myself sleep just a
bit later) to commence what turned out to be a six-hour stretch of tests (and prep for
them)  -- my mid-cycle check to see if/how the chemo is working. I've already found out,
via Dr. Patel, that this morning's echocardiogram shows ""normal cardiac function."" Thank
heavens, as there was always the risk, while slim, that this combo of chemo drugs could
damage my heart. I see (just now) that the results of my PET scan are in as well, but I'm
way too nervous to look at them, and I often need the results translated into laywoman's
terms, and interpreted for me (is cancer making quick work of me? or do I have reason to
feel encouraged?). For this brief moment, ignorance is bliss. I'll wait until tomorrow to
have Dr. Patel (and perhaps Dr. Beavis, if I can get her the imaging tomorrow) parse the
scan results for me. Amazingly, I had a bit of energy to work when I got home, and will
do the same tomorrow while taking it fairly easy (easily?).
                       533 / 1.901
Overall, I'm feeling pretty well. Energy level is good. My stomach continues to be 'wonky'
-- the new normal after removal of two pieces of my colon and two of my small intestine?
My hair has grown back -- curly! It's healthy-feeling.
I needed a day to recharge last weekend so I took all of Saturday off -- took a lovely
walk/talk in the arboretum (pic attached) w/my friend Maria followed by dinner at Barrel
21 (the long, relaxing gab fest did me a lot of good). Sunday I visited with my friends Mar
and Jessica in their beautiful backyard, then enjoyed lunch on Monday (a generally
'laboring' Labor Day for me) with my friend Kathryn in the peaceful outdoor oasis of the
Ale House. It's imperative for my sanity -- and being the extrovert that I am -- that I see
friends 'in the flesh' (outdoors and masked for the most part) from time to time -- no
avatars, no icons, no simulacra. Real people, the best kind.",5,sadness,0.75414914,0.0016677935,0.0031427206,0.0028139828,0.21224391,0.018385906,0.75414914,0.007596594

damaging, nausea- , neuropathy- and body ache-inducing yet ultimately life- sustaining
toxins for doing your work! I've been granted yet another 'reprieve,' and though chemo
continues (next week in fact), I am breathing a bit easier and even allowing myself to
feel somewhat hopeful -- for now.  After thanking God (or a higher power) abundantly, I
had two thoughts, simultaneously: what can I treat myself to to celebrate this great
news (I've been eyeing longingly for some time a few gorgeous rings by Dell Fox, a
Santa Fe jeweler I discovered when Ben and I visited [there's a wacky story behind this
visit] and then there is Tiffany... AND how can I pay forward the tremendous gift I've
received today? I have an idea or two.
Dr. Beavis has not looked at the scans, but I forwarded Dr. Patel's note to her. I asked
to have a disc made for me and was told it would be ready today, but when I got to
Gray's Woods -- no disc, no dice. Ugh! But it's a minor inconvenience. I'll return
tomorrow.

I reviewed your PET-CT scan done on 9/9/2020:
- Previously noted right pelvic lymph node showed interval decrease in the size and
metabolic activity. Now it is measuring around 7 mm. (It was around 1.2 x 0.8 cm in the
previous imaging study). More importantly activity has gone down significantly, SUV
was around 12.3 earlier, now it is around 4.25 suggest good response with the
chemotherapy.
- Previously noted metabolic focus close to the right hepatic hilum is no longer seen.
- No other new suspicious findings noted anywhere else.

150,"Chemo went smoothly today. My kindhearted neighbor Janis drove me to the Geisinger
medical offices before 8:30, and my equally kindhearted, dear friend Helen picked me up
at 1:15, Meyers mocha chip milkshake in hand (love to have the cool, creamy goodness
massage my insides, the chips providing just the right amount of texture, and by 1:15 I
was hungry!). Per routine, I had blood taken, then headed downstairs to Dr. Patel's. Per
my own private ritual, I haven't yet looked too closely at my bloodwork numbers (if they
had been out of whack Dr. Patel would have cancelled today's chemo treatment),
including my telltale CA125 number. Frankly, it takes a lot of mental/physical energy for
me just to gear up for chemo, so I'll hope that Dr. Patel will share the numbers and his
interpretation of them tomorrow. Vitals all fine, thankfully. Dr. Patel showed me the
imaging from my last two PET scans and I could see that cancerous activity in the two
areas of concern - a lymph node in my pelvic area and on the exterior of my liver -- has
decreased. I asked whether the same holds true for the colon, which had been identified
to me as the primary area of recurrence; he told me that the colon is harder to see on
the PET-scan but since activity in the other areas has decreased he presumes the same
holds true for the colon. No other cancerous areas noted, specifically in the lungs and/or
the bones -- which would be bad news.
Of course, he reiterated to me - when I queried him on this - that eliminating all the
cancer cells is virtually impossible. They are lurking and will continue to do so. So that's
the less good news. But the better news is that I'm feeling generally pretty well, my
                       538 / 1.901
energy is good (put in a 10-hour work day the other day), and this treatment appears to
be effective -- so much so, in fact, that Dr. Patel may propose three more rounds of it
after I finish the six initially prescribed. Past nine rounds, he says that I may start to
experience a worsening of my neuropathy -- already bad in my toes, which feel numb all
the time (leading to a fall in Jan. resulting in a broken ankle), but thank goodness not in
my fingers, essential 'tools' for my work. He'll talk to Dr. Beavis and I'll see what kind of
plan they come up with. I trust them. Dr. Patel now seems much warmer towards me --
we joked about how he's a terrible typist because his father encouraged him to learn
languages instead and I learned that both his parents live with him and his family.
""You're doing very well,"" were his parting words.
The Benadryl drip made me so tired today that, without the benefit of morning coffee to
boot, I dozed during chemo, which wasn't unpleasant. My favorite nurse, Tracy, took
good care of me, and we chatted about the challenges of online teaching/learning for her
two high-school aged sons and my own graduate students. And I had an additional 'mini-
snooze' when I got home, then went to a local farm stand to pick up some Honeycrisp
apples (my favorite) to make chicken salad (from the chicken soup I made last night),
plums (I'm thinking compote), zucchini (to stuff sometime soon) and a decorative
pumpkin. On the way home I stopped at Lupita's a great local, authentic Mexican joint in
a Unimart, to pick up some paletas (ice pops in enticing flavor like walnut and coconut).
I've spent the past few hours answering/writing work emails.
My French colleague and friend Dominique Kalifa took his own life a few days ago, on his
63rd birthday. Devastating, shocking news. He had written a chillingly elliptic message --
""Au Revoir"" - on his Facebook and Twitter accounts right beforehand (like others, I
imagined he was taking a social media break). A renowned, pathbreaking historian, he
was always incredibly generous to me, inviting me to speak in his seminar at the
Sorbonne and to contribute an essay to his last edited volume; writing a long review of
my latest book in the French mass daily newspaper, Libération; and taking time to
brainstorm with me about my research. He was brilliant, charming, and had a wonderful
ability to federate colleagues from all over the world in a spirit of professional and
human exchange. Conjecture about the cause of his suicide has been making the rounds
among my friends/colleagues; no need to repeat it here. In trying to have even the
dimmest idea of 'why' -- from the outside he seemed to lead a charmed life, full of
worldwide travel, friends, prestigious acknowledgements of his work etc. -- I know that I
too, have at certain points in my life, have experienced so much psychic pain that I
simply wanted it to *stop.* I've also had to make a few decisions (fortunately not many)
that I *knew* were going to hurt the people I loved most, yet I willfully chose to put my
own needs first. Given my own life situation right now, though, it is at the same time
very difficult for me to understand Dominique's act (this being said, I certainly do *not*
judge it). I'm fighting to stay alive, and am doing just about everything in my power to
*will(a)* both maximal quantity and quality of life. A strong survival instinct seems
hardwired in me right now (and in me generally, I would say...). And the love and support
                       539 / 1.901
of family and friends is, in itself, more than enough to keep me firmly *here.* Of course, I
may/might evaluate this differently when/if I get to a very bleak point medically. But I'm
nowhere near there. So I keep on fighting. ""Reviens très vite parmi nous"" (""Come back to
us [in Paris] very quickly"") Dominique wrote me when I emailed him about my cancer.
Caring words. I wish I could say the same to him, but I can't.
On a more positive note, I was delighted to welcome Vinni, my bff from graduate school
(and Professor of French at Wellesley College), to my graduate seminar Tuesday night
for a most interesting Zoom talk. We have strongly intersecting research interests, as we
have had since grad school at NYU, and we've collaborated on many conference panels
and publications over the years. It was so much fun to team up with my friend of nearly
40 years again. ""We have to carry on the torch,"" I wrote her after Dominique's death.
And now Ben has started his M.S. program at NYU. The circle of life. Round like the round
challah I hope will arrive from Zabar's tomorrow in time for erev Rosh Hashanah
tomorrow night (yes, I splurged big time on some 'the real deal' eats). 
I will try to write another update tomorrow.

151,"This is the second New Year I've been able to welcome in since my ""alive day"" last May. 
So -- and because I'm a bit rushed right now getting ready for the holiday -- I will, for the
first time, post a 'reprint' from last 29 September. So much has changed since then.
COVID has upended our lives - irrevocably? My mother and I have enjoyed many a Rosh
Hashanah here together: she comes up to State College, we cook up a storm, go to
services followed by a nice lunch, then tashlich, marked by a pleasant stroll in Walnut
Creek Park with other congregants. This year I'm solo -- I'm sad to be without my family,
but I'm ok. And traditions must continue! Last year, as I recall, I felt very worn out (I was
undergoing my first course of chemo) but still managed to whip up a brisket with
pomegranate sauce. This year I'm feeling stronger -- undergoing ""second line"" treatment
for a recurrence, but I seem to be responding quite well. No hair loss, better energy,
working full time. I had chemo yesterday but still had ample energy to make chicken
soup, honey cakes and a plum compote w/vanilla and cardamon. For the rest of the meal
I splurged and ordered a big boxload of goodies from Zabar's -- matzah balls, chopped
liver, herring in cream sauce, noodle pudding, gefilte fish and a round challah (a lovely
fellow congregant also brought me a round challah today - so kind of her).  I think I'll
dress cute, putting on a new skirt I ordered from Anne-Elisabeth in Paris, my favorite
shop for clothes.  At 8 I'll Zoom into services w/my congregation; ditto for tomorrow
morning. And if I have the energy (I often go into a post-chemo crash after two days), I'll
perform tashlich beside one of our pretty local streams.  I hope I can make it.
I am fine. And I received the good news this morning that my CA125 level has dropped
two more points, to 17 from 19 - still trending in a good direction. I think I'll have a glass
of wine to celebrate the birthday of the world. Let's hope for a better 5781 than the year
before. We need it.
Blessings to all.
Last year's post:
Today is the birthday of the world, Jewish tradition teaches, a time of renewal and hope
for the year ahead. We've fully entered the month of elul, which coincides with early
autumn, and the ""Days of Awe:"" Rosh Hashanah, on which our fate for the new year is
written, and Yom Kippur, on which it is is sealed. Our lives are depicted as being in the
balance during these days before the 'gates close:' ""who shall live to a ripe old age and
                       541 / 1.901
who shall lie dying on a bed of pain?"" It's an existential state; we're truly 'on the narrow
bridge.' We beat our chests as we catalog the sins that we've been guilty of the past
year. Yet we are told that teshuvah (repentence or return), tefillah (prayer) and tzedakah
(charity) can temper the harshness of God's decree.
Having had to confront my own mortality over the past few months, the spiritual side of
my journey has come into fuller relief, including during the holidays. I'll welcome the
opportunity at dinner tonight, while blessing a round challah, symbol of the cycle of life,
and later at services, to tap into feelings of hopefulness, renewal, and immanence. To
Emily Dickinson, hope is ""the thing with feathers-/That perches in the soul-"" that can be
heard in ""the chillest land-/And on the strangest Sea-"" I've indeed felt glimmers of hope
in the 'chillest land' and 'strangest Sea' where I've found myself struggling over the past
few months. As for my fate, it surely lies somewhere at the intersection of the designs of
some nasty, aggressive, microscopic cancer cells, the skills of my medical team, and my
own fighting spirit. 
I am spiritual, yet agnostic. I apologize if this offends any believers who may be reading
this. But I do firmly believe in the manifestation of 'godly' qualities in people, animals,
and nature, whether it be loving kindness, graciousness, mercifulness, or compassion. I
have seen these attributes displayed time and time again since my diagnosis, whether
through friends coming to spend time with me, text or call me, send me thoughtful gifts,
volunteer to do errands for me, cook for me, drive me to Baltimore, or just 'hold space'
for me. It is quite wondrous. 
It is a wonderful holiday this year because my mother and Ben are here. My mother and I
have been cooking up a storm; I'm not quite sure how I managed to pull it off as at the
beginning of the week I was completely wiped out from chemo, but I was searing brisket
and frying onions in pomegranate molasses early this morning. I was hoping that Ben
might take some interest in the holiday cooking (he certainly does in the eating), as I'm
not sure who will continue the culinary traditions after my mother and me.",5,sadness,0.56543165,0.0043856576,0.0030449973,0.011220799,0.26042566,0.13238157,0.56543165,0.023109663

As I often do, I marshaled all my strength, put on a cute outfit, jewelry and makeup, and 
donned my game face for the holiday, which I willed into pleasantness and some
semblance of normalcy. By Saturday, my post-chemo crash was in high gear, per usual:
exhaustion, nausea, headache, stomach ache (beginning of a stomach blockage? hope
not -- two hospitalizations on that score were more than enough for me), entire body
sensitive to the touch (and not in a good way; pained me even to touch my head lightly).
Every time I walked past my bed, it seemed, I had to crash, missing out on most of some
beautiful days. Ditto Sunday, although the fatigue and feeling crappy became layered
over w/stress as I dug into my heavy workload for the week. Today's just slightly better.
The body aches are not as intense, but I've had a headache all day and nausea that
caused some vomiting, which actually made me feel better. Chicken soup is the only
food that appeals. Luckily I was able to cry my eyes out to my therapist online - combo of
feeling crappy, work stress, being physically alone for the holiday, social media overload
following RBG's death, and pandemic-induced isolation all feel overwhelming today. 
When I say that chemo 'went well,' what I mean by that is that I had no repeat of the
horrifying allergic reaction that sent my blood pressure and heart rate plummeting a few
treatments ago, as my chest constricted rapidly. It means that I succeeded in
summoning the psychic energy to allow toxins to penetrate my body for several hours. It
means that I accept that the treatment is melting away some cancer cells but leaving
others lurking, to cause their ravaging damage at will. It means I didn't spend all night
vomiting into a trash can.
Please understand the herculean effort involved in being a cancer patient, especially as I
try to do a credible job with my work, my mothering, being a friend, and with all the
other things I do. Even for one as practiced as myself in 'pulling it all off' artfully and
graciously, it's not easy by any means.

I don't have time to write at length as I'd like to, as I'm readying for Kol Nidre, but this core prayer from the
Yom Kippur liturgy has of course had special resonance for me the past two holidays, and it has always seemed
ominous to me. My life's in the balance tonight. Call me a bad Jew, though, but I know it can't all be in God's
                       551 / 1.901
hands (those cancer cells have a mind of their own). And while we're taught that study of Torah/prayer,
repentance, and charity can temper God's harsh decree, I'm hoping that living a virtuous, meaningful life
defined in my own terms will be its own reward. On this day of atonement, though, I did write a friend who I
know I hurt recently through my words and actions. I'm hoping they'll realize that my intentions were good, but
that I mishandled a delicate situation and acted maladroitly. The blessing is that they told me I had hurt them,
paving the way for a not entirely pleasant but productive path back towards one another.
Who shall live and who shall die? While I've had a not great week health-wise -- something if off w/my
digestion and a nearly a week of a liquid diet has not seemed to help so I'll be calling my doctors again
tomorrow -- my gut (no pun intended) tells me that I'll still be here next year. Again, not to take anything away
from the Almighty but rather just acknowledging the realistic odds and my recent good response to this round of
chemo. I won't be fasting, of course (although in essence I am!), because of my health, but I'll still hope to clear
out a good mental space for contemplation over the next day and a half.

I'm just emerging from what I hope is a health blip (and nothing worse), which
nevertheless landed me in the ER for most of Tuesday. I had mentioned, I believe, that
since a few days after my last chemo treatment, my intestines and stomach had been
feeling 'wonky,' as they often do.  I'm sure it's somehow related to the lingering issues
from this past March's fistula repair surgery. The symptoms are not pleasant, but they
felt reminiscent of my three previous intestinal blockages, two of which resulted in
hospital stays and one of which I was able to resolve on my own by observing a liquid
diet and massaging my abdomen. On Dr. Beavis' advice I recommenced a liquid diet,
which didn't really seem to alleviate the symptoms. Further, I began to feel quite weak
from not eating (although I tried to ingest some high-calorie liquids like milkshakes) and 
quickly dropped about six pounds. I also had agonizing leg and foot cramps at night,
from being dehydrated (even though I was drinking as much as I could) and low on
potassium. One night the cramps woke me up about once an hour -- torturous. Each time
I had to do some combination of walking around, applying a heating pad, and massaging
the cramped area until the cramp(s) resolved. By the time the last cramp shot me out of
bed at around 6 a.m. I was so exhausted and in so much pain that I broke into a cold
sweat, vomited a few times, and just crumpled on my bed, with that Carrie Underwood
country song going through my head: ""Jesus, take the wheel."" Je n'en pouvais plus.
Monday I called my PCP, Dr. Damaske, hoping he could see me, but he was also booked.
I also called Dr. Beavis, who said she'd place an order for me to have an abdominal X-
ray. The order wasn't ready when I called Hopkins and in fact was never emailed to me.
The next morning, my PCP's office called to see how I was doing and to say that Dr.
Damaske suggested I go immediately to the ER (which Dr. Patel had suggested as well),
to make sure I didn't have a blockage (which needless to say, if it bursts, can be
extremely serious). I powered through an important monthly meeting of deans and
department heads, to be followed by a second department heads meeting for our School
of Global Languages, Literatures and Cultures. By the time I got to that meeting and was
telling one of my colleagues (also a cancer survivor) that I wasn't feeling great, he and
the other school heads began urging me to skip our meeting and go straight to the ER.
So I did.
My kind neighbor Janis drove me to the ER. I had packed a bag with a few days' worth of
clothes and my laptop, as I fully expected to be admitted for a blockage and was
anticipating having an NG (gastric) tube inserted. I had hoped to avoid the ER like the
plague because they have been treating COVID patients. The young doctor (I could
swear he was the doctor who broke the news of a malignancy to me when I dragged
myself to the ER last Easter Sunday), nurses and techs took good care of me and
administered all the tests (EKG, blood, vitals, urine etc.). To my great relief, based on the
scans taken in the ER I do *not* have a blockage: there is some colitis and a potential
intestinal infection (don't have the results on that yet). And some of my symptoms
remain puzzling to me. I am seeing my PCP next Tuesday -- he's a compassionate guy
who gave me his personal cell phone number when he learned I had cancer, in case I
                       554 / 1.901
need to contact him quickly. I hope we can puzzle through some of the symptoms
together. Maybe I need to further rethink my diet (have been reading recipes for cancer
smoothies). Maybe I need a reset of some kind. Maybe my digestive system is not
absorbing certain nutrients well, or correctly Surely I was burnt out from not eating, so I
feel tired and find myself needing some extra sleep. So...much...uncertainty. Cancer
sucks.
To my regret, because I am ultra-conscientious when it comes to work, I had to cancel
Tuesday night's grad seminar as I didn't think I'd be home in time to Zoom (I wasn't).
We've already figured out a plan for moving forward. Equally to my regret, I did arrive
home in time to watch the debate aka horror show aka assault aka Trump unhinged,
while sipping soup and trying to relax (not the best plan). I.can't.even. Grotesque bully.
Shameless demon. Ominous boor. Asshole. I was still shaking the next morning.
Last night my dear friend Maria spontaneously invited me to join her for a bite, so we
headed to one of our favorite spots, Barrel 21 (it's a distillery). We sat outside in their
patio area on a chilly night, but we were kept toasty with big outdoor heaters, the kind
that make Paris cafés so pleasurable in the winter. Our friend John joined us for a while.
Various immune system-compromising medical issues are keeping him holed up in a
barn on his property, while his wife and one son sleep in the main house and the other
son quarantines at his grandmother's because he's daily exposed to other college
students. How dramatically COVID affects the fabric of our social and familial relations. I
ate something very mild and enjoyed a delicious fruit-juice based, healthy 'mocktail,'
prepared by B21's bartender extraordinaire, Josh. So very grateful to be back from the
precipice enjoying the evening with friends.
Thank you, Jackie, for your many kindnesses including cancelling your dentist's
appointment so you could drive me home from the hospital! Thank you, Ben, Ethan and
Mom for your care and concern. Be well, everyone.",2,fear,0.4178804,0.010170245,0.124296844,0.4178804,0.0053030914,0.11939954,0.29565084,0.027299035

Because my last report was so grim, I wanted to write briefly to assure everyone that I'm
doing much better. My digestion seems to have returned to semi-normal (or as normal as
it ever gets for me), I'm eating sensibly, and I regained the few pounds I dropped
precipitously during the week I went on liquids. I had an appointment with my PCP this
past week and he prescribed a daily dose of potassium (my level is within normal range
but on the lower side), a daily probiotic, and an another appointment with a nutritionist,
this one specializing in both cancer patients and digestive issues. I will follow up.
Meanwhile, it was a busy week at school with some big projects starting to pile up.
Seminar went quite well (always a pleasure to teach about the Dreyfus Affair, so
relevant...) and I led a faculty meeting and attended a host of other meetings etc. So
very grateful for my rewarding, secure job yet undoubtedly we're traversing a difficult
period in academia, as in so many other fields: the job market for our graduate students
seems bleak this year; our library has been hit with v. significant budget cuts targeting
the humanities in particular (this occasioned pushback in the form of a letter to the
Provost from the humanities' department heads); Penn State IT abruptly laid off thirty
employees; some colleagues (and especially female ones) who are balancing work
w/overseeing their kids' remote learning seemed totally maxed out; etc. We have a
wonderful, empathic dean in Liberal Arts who is  trying to keep us all afloat and moving
forward as best he can, but he's stressed too. We all are.
Given all this -- ie the strains and just plain weirdness of the moment, the dismaying
national backdrop etc. -- in addition to my health challenges, I try to be extra gentle with
myself to the extent possible. This morning I went to the farmers market with my friend
Helen. I started to feel momentarily light-headed (a 'thing' that can happen to me
sometimes when I'm dehydrated or have a slight stomach ached) but rebounded after
sitting down for a while. Then treated myself to a manicure at a local day spa, followed
by clothes shopping (bought one top) and then a mocha chip ice cream cone from
Meyers Dairy. Yesterday, I enjoyed a lovely lunch outdoors at the Ale House with my
friend/former colleague Kathryn, then moved on to my hair stylist's (my hair continues to
grow out but is unruly because of the haphazard way it's come back in). Tomorrow,
weather permitting, I'll walk a few loops at the Boalsburg Military Museum with a group
of wonderful women (these monthly walks grew out of the ovarian cancer fundraiser I
organized this past June). Then back to work and prepping for a week of meetings, with
big admin tasks to tackle.
Chemo this Wednesday, undoubtedly followed by up to a week of feeling like crap. As
long as I don't wind up in the ER again. 
Currently have two women facing cancer (one at the beginning of her journey, one
towards the end) in my prayers.

If all goes as planned, Ben and Sammi will come home for Thanksgiving. I miss them.
Michael and I are trying to coordinate a joint family meal, as we did last year (pre-Covid),
but of course it's challenging as not everyone's been 'podding' together all along and
there's a certain amount of risk involved. So it's possible we might have to have two
dinners on consecutive nights, one with each family unit. I'm also sorry I can't go to NY
and celebrate with my mother and Arnold, Ethan and his family, but that too is risky right
now. Complicated times (sigh). Meanwhile, there's a new Borat movie to look forward to!

156,"Chemo went smoothly yesterday. Dr. Patel was not there as he's getting board
recertified this week, but the nurses took good care of me. My favorite nurse, Tracey,
                       561 / 1.901
administered my treatment and I was further delighted to see that another very kind
nurse (Brianne), who had come to my home several times as a visiting nurse, is now also
working in oncology. The chemo room was bustling but as soon as I was pumped full of
Benadryl I started to doze, which was actually quite relaxing. A new chemo room will be
opening in January. It will be sparkling new, with spiffy recliners, new equipment and -
best of all - windows (sorely lacking in the current configuration). At that point, I am not
sure what my chemo status will be. I may be taking oral chemo exclusively. But it's nice
to know of this improvement. Being in a windowless environment during chemo,
especially on a lovely fall day, is dispiriting.
My dear friend Helen drove me to chemo, and passed along a yummy brownie that one
of her daughters had kindly thought to share with me. My equally dear neighbor Janis
picked me up and we stopped at Meyer Dairy so I could get a mocha chip malted
milkshake. So comforting, such a cooling treat.
Today I was slightly deflated to learn that my CA125 number had increased ever so
slightly, from 17.5 to 17.7. Both Dr. Beavis' and Dr. Patel's nurses urged me NOT to
worry about this, though, insisting it is considered stable and still very much within
normal range. And Dr. Beavis' nurse did put the NOT in capitals! But of course I was
hoping for another drop - psychologically, it makes a difference. But I will try my hardest
to take it off my 'worry list' for now.
I feel ok today, slightly nauseous per usual. And I expect the very unpleasant symptoms
to hit tomorrow. Had an important meeting w/our Graduate Dean, which went well, and I
need to run and get my white blood cell booster shot now, before dinner (later) and a
Zoom meeting for my condo association at 7 p.m.
And all this on about 5 hours of sleep. Strangely, I awoke at 4 a.m. and was up for
several hours, my mind overloaded with a minutia dump -- what should I put on my
grocery list for the young woman who shops for me every week? How can I best get
organized for the meeting w/the Dean? But somehow broader horizons were opening and
constricting during this hour, as the French call it, ""between chien et loup"" (""between
dog and wolf;"" apparently, according to a former therapist, this is the hour when most
suicides occur, but I can assure everyone that this was *nowhere* near my mind early
this morning!).
Opening horizons: a new couch I had been awaiting for several months finally arrived
and looks lovely in my sun room. Texting a friend about this arrival, I mistakenly wrote
""son room"" (paging Dr. Freud, etc.), because my *son* and I have spent many hours in
the sun room over the last decade, watching t.v., talking, chilling. So I've been moving
furniture and photos around, opening up new physical (and mental?) spaces, trying to
make my home more like, in Ben's girlfriend Sammi's word, my 'oasis.'
                       562 / 1.901
And meeting (via Zoom) some new people who have led, and are leading, interesting
lives -- another horizon opening. Fascinating, complex, textured journeys -- enough to
keep me up at 4 a.m. just contemplating them!
Constricting horizons: sometimes I get griped by fear about my health. That fear was
also 'visited' upon me at 4 a.m. What's my horizon? 2 years? 5-8? 8-10? More? I read a
post this morning from an admirable seeming woman who 'friended' me on Facebook in
June but whom I've never met -- she is also treated at KGOS (Kelly Gynecological
Oncology Service at Hopkins) and we 'met' at the time of the Service's big annual
fundraiser (my #willapower turn). Her ovarian cancer has now spread into her lungs (I
worry about this too but for now it's 'just' the exterior of my colon that's affected) but
she's warrior-ing on. So many brave women fighting this accursed disease. 
Grateful today for the gorgeous fall colors, kind texts and emails from family and friends,
grateful to have plenty during this awful time (number of Americans below poverty line
has increased by 8.000.000 since May -- what becomes of them, dear God?!). Life is
good today. And that's reason enough to be grateful. Off to my condo association
meeting to talk about fall leaf collection, landscaping and other blessed mundanities.

157,"Thank you to all who checked in on me and/or thought about me over the weekend. I'm
always slightly amazed that I can rebound given that two days after each of my current
chemo treatments I feel like I'm succumbing to the worst flu imaginable plus an achy
lower back and abdomen. Like clockwork, on chemo day + 2 my entire body, but
especially my head and neck area, begins to feel very tender and painful to the touch,
accompanied by nausea. I simply feel *sore.* On chemo day + 3 I am completely
useless. Yesterday (when I reached the bottom of the abyss,) I slept until about 11 a.m.,
then had barely enough energy to drag myself to the couch, where I spent the rest of the
day, dozing and later watching some t.v., pumped up with anti-nausea meds, Claritin to
counteract bone pain, and Ibuprofen. I felt sad and slightly depressed not being able to
enjoy the gorgeous autumn day but knew I simply had to renounce any plans
whatsoever. Admittedly, my new couch is very comfy and I was cozily wrapped in a
lovely pashima shawl (a gift from my friend Melissa - I owe you a thank you!), with a
heating pad plopped on my stomach. My friend Helen was kind enough to bring 'Jewish
penicillin' aka chicken soup, plus apple cider, Hagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream and some
tasty feta/caramelized onion appetizer bites from Trader Joe's, out of which I concocted a
small meal last night (although I hardly ate much at all during the day, perhaps one
yogurt). Drifted in and out through the day, the sun washing over me, knowing that the
only way out of this painful morass was through. Might have benefited from some psalms
or other 'inspirational' literature (encouraging fortune cookies?) but scarcely had the
energy to lift a book, iPad or even iPhone. Geez, I sure hope these super-strong drugs
are at least melting away more cancer cells. And next round *may* be my last before a
scan and then (?) oral chemo (parp inhibitors). I need to get the lowdown from Beavis
and Patel.
Slept deeply and at length again, my father appeared in my dream, which rarely if ever
happens - we were in disagreement about something. Miraculously, feel today like I'm
just starting to round the bend, was able to sit at my desk and work for a while, while still
feeling worn out. Took a little drive (while I was absorbed with my pain, somehow late
fall seems to have made an early-ish arrival). Hoping for more improvement tomorrow,
as the work week begins. Much to do. The couch may be calling my name again this

Everything's ok. It's been a busy week, and I've worked hard, so am treating myself to
Thai takeout tonight (mildly flavored dishes) and an evening curled up on the couch
watching t.v.  -- my reward for six hours straight of zoom meetings today. The meetings
were not uninteresting: first, an annual four-hour meeting with the other heads of Big
Ten foreign language departments to discuss our common concerns (many, given the
circumstances; COVID + the xenophobic policies of the current administration are having
dire effects on academic institutions) and brainstorm solutions. Then a long department
meeting that I organized with a facilitator present to begin discussing a host of issues
related to DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) as they affect our department. The meetings
required much focus and mental and emotional energy>I'm beat!
I am feeling alright. I get fatigued, but you probably wouldn't know it observing what I
sometimes accomplish in a day or week, including teaching a three-hour seminar every
Tuesday night. And my digestive system still has a mind (or stomach) of its own. I am
meeting again with a nutritionist next week. I've woken up a few nights with leg cramps
but I've also enjoyed some delightful sleeps. Next chemo on Nov. 12th. After that round
there will certainly be a scan. I'm not sure what follows, perhaps some oral
chemotherapy (parp inhibitors).
This morning, for some reason, I made the mistake of reverifying the prognoses for
ovarian cancer, which I hadn't done in awhile. According the American Cancer Society,
the five-year survival rate is 50%. Full stop. I don't know how the effect of my already
having had one recurrence inflects this statistic; I do remember Dr. Beavis telling me
that she felt my recurrence was a bit anomalous, perhaps related to the host of fistula-
related problems I experienced earlier this year. She has also told me that part of my
cancer (the 'sarcoma' part I suppose) is particularly aggressive. Conversely, statistics for
Hopkins patients, I was told (also by Dr. Beavis) may look somewhat better than the
averages. I took this info into the shower with me and had a good cry, coupled with an
anxiety attack. Then I put on a nice blouse, a cute hairband, and some make-up and
went about my meetings. Yet those numbers stick in my throat. On which side of the
50% will I fall? I *do* know long-term survivors (but were their cancers as aggressive as
mine?). Given my potentially shortened life expectancy, should I be going about my
business as usual? Or hitting my bucket list? Ok for me to have Thai take-out or should
the entirety of my nutrition be geared towards starving those cancer cells in any way I
can? I think I'm generally taking good care of myself, but can I do more? Trade-offs.
Uncertainty. Anxiety. Ugh. ""You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on.""
I look forward to a relatively low-key week-end although I'll need to turn to work by
Sunday, if not before. I foresee some soup-making (butternut squash bisque and creamy
tomato tortellini). Trying to puzzle through the challenge of how to see my friends safely
now that it's turning colder. Ugh.

Awaiting Tuesday with trepidation. Will vote on 'the day,'  braving a long line if
necessary. Fingers crossed, folks, that the end of our four-year national nightmare may
be in sight.
Today this picture of my favorite mummy made me smile. This was the one 'homemade'
costume I ever ventured to make for Ben, and it was a success (although requiring yards
and yards of gauze!). I always felt somewhat 'mom-shamed' by all the incredible
handmade costumes I saw kids sporting on Halloween but this one made me feel at least
somewhat vindicated! Ben was having so much fun trying to look 'spooky!'",4,neutral,0.34893355,0.009130372,0.008922647,0.016277805,0.17048915,0.34893355,0.26604965,0.18019678

I couldn't receive my chemo this morning, as planned. My blood work revealed that my
hemoglobin level is very low (7.6; normal for women is 12.0 to 15.3 grams per liter).
Apparently, my level has been trending downwards for the past several months.
Apparently too, this is a fairly common effect of chemo. Dr. Patel's concern was that if he
treated me, my hemoglobin level might drop so low that I'd need, in his words, ""a bag of
blood."" He ordered another lab test to determine whether my low hemoglobin level is
due to the chemo or, rather, to an iron deficiency (from diet, for example). If it's due to
chemo, he can give me an infusion of iron through my port. If it's due to diet, I guess I
need to eat more iron rich foods or maybe take an iron supplement. He seemed to
hesitate about whether we should go ahead with treatment today or wait a week
because, as I pointed out, there's no guarantee that in a week's time my hemoglobin
level will have risen if the trend has been downwards for several months. In the end,
though, he said: ""Let's play it safe."" Part of me wanted to insist a bit about receiving
treatment today because waiting a week means that I'll barely be starting to rebound for
Thanksgiving, Ben and Sammi's long awaited visit, and a whole mess of holiday cooking
I've been anticipating (with pleasure). Now I have to rethink my cooking schedule and I'll
surely need to enlist the kids' help. Oh well. Is it what it is. The best laid plans, yadda
yadda...
The next problem was getting me on the schedule for next week. Everyone wants to
have her/his chemo finished before the holiday. I scheduled for next Thursday morning
(the only available time), knowing that this means I'll have to miss a fairly important
meeting. Perhaps it can be Zoom-recorded for me. There was a moment when I started
to feel overwhelmed -- between the difficulty scheduling the appointment to uncertainty
about whether I need to go back to the lab for another blood test to being unsure how I
would get home from Dr. Patel's office as my friend Helen had kindly driven me there to
feeling upset that I couldn't receive treatment today. I sunk down onto a bench in Dr.
Patel's office and my eyes started stinging with tears, but I regained composure pretty
quickly. I called my neighbor, Janis, and she was able to pick me up. We immediately
launched into chat about how happy we were with the election results (she said her
pastor had delivered an ambiguous sermon about the results, as most of her fellow
parishioners are Trumpiacs...).
Well, now I may better understand why I felt so winded this past weekend on walks with
my friends Chris (Saturday) and Mary, Jackie and Clare (Sunday). And why I've generally
been feeling very tired recently (I had chalked it up to work stress and the effects of
having pushed through twelve weeks of the semester without a break). And perhaps why
I was craving a hamburger this morning (I did, indeed, treat myself to a delicious, juicy
hamburger with sweet potato fries for lunch!).
It remains frustrating and stressful for me to cope with things beyond my control, like
                       572 / 1.901
today's false start. As for my future treatment, that too remains unclear for the moment,
although the likelihood is that I'll be put on maintenance therapy, ie oral chemo that will
hopefully, I suppose, keep my cancer in check and has been shown to have success with
patients like me who have both had a recurrence and do not have the BRCA mutation
(remember that my cancer is the result of a random, non-inherited mutation, the [bad]
luck of the genetic draw...). I asked Dr. Patel how long I would need that treatment and
he said he really couldn't tell me. It will depend on how I respond, to be assessed
through periodic scans and bloodwork. So...much...uncertainty. The ""oh great"" news with
these parp inhibitors (the equivalent of my current treatment's causing heart damage in
a small number of patients) is that it can adversely affect bone marrow, also in a limit
number of patients. 
I am, as always, so grateful for the well wishes, offers of food, cards and many other
kindnesses that come my way before (and often during and after!) each treatment. They
really lift my spirits and help me warrior on. Yet I felt so wiped out when I got home
around noon -- again perhaps the effect of the low red blood cell count + a very busy
Monday-Wednesday at work + the anxiety around the blip this morning -- that I had to
nap/rest a good part of the afternoon. Feeling a bit better now, still tired.
Also: my hair continues to morph as it grows in. I saw my stylist, Sarah, yesterday
(below) and she did a good job. I'm also experimenting with scarves and turbans. And
makeup works wonders. I bought a lot of new clothes the other day. I try to convince
myself that if I look ok, I'm ok. Magical thinking, I know, but it works at least some of the
time.
 
p.s. **I do need to retain that Dr. Patel said I've done well with this treatment. At least as
of last month, my CA125 number was in the normal range (I'll likely have this month's
results tomorrow). That is a good thing indeed.
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change;
courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time;
enjoying one moment at a time.

160,"I've often found 'playing it safe' challenging, much like 'adulting' in general, sometimes.
Yet these strange COVID times, compounded by my immunocompromised state, demand
it. So Dr. Patel decided we should 'play it safe' by delaying my chemo one week. Here's
the update since then: additional blood tests revealed *no* deficiencies in iron, folic acid
and B12. So what's the deal with my severe anemia? Blame the chemo, Dr. Beavis wrote
me. It kills both (bad) cancer cells and (good) red blood cells. Likely no amount of
oatmeal with raisins, salmon, dried and fresh pineapple, spinach and calves liver (all of
which I've eaten or will eat within the next few days) will boost my red blood cell count
significantly, although it can't hurt. Nor will an infusion of iron. So we have to hope that
an extra week off from chemo will allow my body a bit more time to rebound. Crossing
my fingers that my treatment can proceed as (re)planned this coming Thursday.
CA125 number is 18.2. Over the past three months, it's inched upwards from 17.2 to
17.5 to 18.2, but is still well within the normal range of 0-35. Dr. Patel's nurse considers
                       578 / 1.901
it 'stable.' This is good news (my bad memory of my o.c. marker trending upwards before
I was diagnosed with a recurrence is still very much with me, but I'm presuming this
small an increase is still deemed negligible). Drs. Patel and Beavis conferred by phone
the other day and here's the plan: I'll have the final round of chemo, then a scan. Then
I'll have a break (not sure how long) so that my body can recoup before being started on
a parp inhibitor, ie oral chemo for 'maintenance.' This relatively new (?) treatment has
proven effective in patients (some? most?) who do *not* have the BRCA mutation but
who have had a recurrence (this is my case). I do not know how long I'll be on them nor
what the potential side effects are. I am not yet at a point where I can process that
information, especially if it contains worrisome elements (the potential for bone marrow
damage was already sufficiently anxiety-provoking, thank you very much). So I'll get
myself mentally prepared to discuss the next step with Dr. Patel (and perhaps also Dr.
Beavis) this coming week. For now I'm focused on receiving my last round of chemo and
turning the corner by Thanksgiving, after exhaustion sets in next weekend.
And in ""Playing it Safe"" news, Part II: I'm very disappointed that Ben and Sammi will not,
in the end, be coming home for Thanksgiving this year. All of us were starting to feel
increasingly alarmed by the rising COVID rates all over the country, and testing and
quarantining are not foolproof guarantees against infection, especially taking into
account travel, contact with new germ pools etc. The thought running through my head
recently, which I had been getting ready to share with Michael: ""If anything happens to
the kids, I'll never forgive myself."" So we're playing it safe. Of course, I love
Thanksgiving, revel in the cooking and sharing of my 'standards' (cranberry chutney,
sweet potato casserole, jalapeno cornbread etc.), enjoy gathering with family. This year
COVID has conspired, though, to dislocate families and ramp up a sense of familial and
social alienation. Many friends will likewise be separated from loved ones at the holidays
this year. So in 2020 we'll have a modern family meets COVID Thanksgiving with a twist:
ex-husband and I will split the cooking (Michael excels at cooking the turkey, so he's in
charge of the bird) but enjoy the feast in two different households; since I'll be physically
alone, my mother (also alone), Ben and Sammi, and I (and anyone else who wants to
join) will (hopefully) gather virtually via Zoom. We'll make it work. It truly sucks, but
COVID oblige...
I hope we'll figure out a way to get together over the December holidays. We'll see how
things are looking COVID-wise in the city and elsewhere and how I and everyone else
involved are feeling. I'm missing the city so maybe I can contemplate a visit involving/an
airbnb rental. So much of this is out of my control. We'll just roll with it.
I was feeling so overloaded by all these blips that I got in my car and started driving,
which is what I often do these days to settle myself. I headed out into the country on
winding roads, past farms, buggies, trees shedding their last autumn leaves, creeks,
farm stands -- and plenty of Trump signs, still defiant. I straightened the house, cleaned
the kitchen, and had a piece of jewelry repaired. Now it's time to pay bills (exciting,
                       579 / 1.901
huh?) and see if I can find a good flick or Netflix offering this evening. Back to work
tomorrow.

I completed my last round of IV chemo -- for now -- yesterday. Grand total: twelve rounds
with about a three+ month interval between them when I was (relatively briefly) in
remission. I am not currently in remission but at least the Beast is at bay -- for now. And
overall this second line of chemo has been effective: CA125 number is within normal
range, apparently there's been no further spread (which a CT scan on 12/9 will either
confirm or deny), my bloodwork looks ok overall (although I'm still low on potassium and
iron, despite eating calves' liver nearly every night last week, plus iron-rich oatmeal,
dried fruits, spinach etc.). I have awful neuropathy in my toes -- can hardly feel them,
and I don't expect that to dissipate. But, as my former father-in-law Seymour used to
say, mock-sighing heavily: ""I'm still vertical"" (actually, if chemo fatigue progresses as
usual, I expect to be horizontal for nearly the entire weekend).
Unlike last week, everything proceeded smoothly yesterday. My hemoglobin level had
increased from 7 to 8 (still low), so we proceeded with chemo. Tracey, my favorite nurse,
took good care of me. Pumped full of Benadryl, I took a snooze. The whole process takes
about five hours (including having bloodwork and then waiting for results). Dear friends
Helen and Jackie transported me to and from, Jackie bearing the ceremonial 'chemo's
done' milkshake that I crave afterwards (mocha chip with malt, so soothing...).
Since I know that I'm likely to crash tomorrow, I try to use the 1.5 days in between
chemo and crash to power through my to-do list. Yesterday and today that entailed
some holiday cooking (I returned from chemo to cook up a veritable *vat* of cranberry
chutney); putting out fires at work; other work-related emailing; scanning readings for
my grad students; picking up a prescription; throwing together a pot of chicken soup for
both myself when I'm couch potato-ing this weekend and a friend who will need some
too; getting my follow-up shot; and enjoying a glorious *outdoor* lunch with my friend
Kathryn on this 60-degree November day. All this after a wretched sleep when my mind
was spinning, consumed with petty worries about the center of my cornbread being
undercooked, the pile of dishes in my sink that needed to be washed and the dishwasher
unloaded before my housecleaner arrived, the potential overhaul of one of our core
graduate courses -- and more. Hoping for a better sleep tonight.
I treated myself to a pair of dangly Art Deco-looking earrings (via Etsy) for finishing
chemo and I might also indulge in a pair of low black suede boots.
Relieved to have a 'chemo break' for now, while my body recoups and strengthens for
the next stage. I'll see Dr. Patel on 12/17 to discuss the oral chemo that I'll take next. Dr.
Beavis says that ""it's worth a try,"" ie we'll see how I do with it and whether I can handle
the side effects (I have chosen not to inform myself about them yet; I just need to
decompress and chill for a while before I get back on my chemo horse). The goal, as Dr.
Beavis sees it, is to maintain as good a quality of life for me as possible. If it turns out I
                       583 / 1.901
can't handle the effects -- well then, I think the plan might be to wait for the return of the
Beast, whenever It chooses to attack me again. I need to regroup and find out more
about next steps but not...just...yet.
When the drug company called me today to set up delivery of the likely medication
(Zejula) -- I told them I didn't want it delivered until I had discussed the treatment plan
w/Dr. Patel -- I initially nearly fainted of sticker shock -- something about an $1800
copay. However, I then learned that there is some sort of prescription card I'll receive
that will reduce the co-pay to... $0. And my insurance will cover the rest. What happens
to the women who are uninsured??
Sad I won't be with family this year for Thanksgiving but at least there's Zoom. We had a
lovely and delicious holiday last year at Michael and Sue's -- several of Ben's boyhood
friends dropped by for delicious pie that Ben had brought from Buttercream Bakery in DC
-- and I look forward to being reunited with family next year. 
Am also looking forward to a Zoom apéro (likely herbal tea for me) on Sunday afternoon
w/my bffs from graduate school -- Vinni, Shanny, Isabelle and Doris (in Paris) - aka ""les
filles."" Laughs guaranteed.

163,"Just a quick post to let everyone know I'm doing ok at the close of  my monthly weekend
from hell. I was certain that Saturday I'd wake up with the worst flu-like symptoms
imaginable, and as if on cue...: body aches; head, neck and back tenderness; nausea;
diarrhea; mild headache; loss of appetite; no energy etc. I went to bed Friday night by
about 11:00 and didn't get out of bed until Saturday at 4 p.m., and only then to ingest a
bowl of oatmeal, and later some homemade chicken noodle soup. Dragged myself into
bed again last night around 11 p.m. and got out of bed close to noon. I've spent the past
two days in a twilight haze -- in the gloaming. It's all about pushing through. At some
point I was on the couch watching a Netflix documentary about a gospel choir, a heating
pad plopped on my stomach.

I feel marginally better today and know that I'll likely start to slowly rebound tomorrow. I
did manage a long Zoom call (unfortunately I was on speakerphone as my internet was
acting out) with my grad school besties, with Doris joining us from Paris. So restorative,
so comforting, so relaxing, so much fun to catch up with these dear friends of nearly
forty years, whether we're comparing notes on our kids (we have five young men and a
young woman among us), venting about work, or trading Thanksgiving plans. The
precise topics matter less than the powerful connection.
I miss New York and my family this holiday week. The picture below was taken two years
ago in the city, after our Thanksgiving meal at an Italian (if I remember correctly)
restaurant on the UWS.  The restaurant bustled and we were all in good spirits, happy to
be together, and healthy. Who knew we'd be caught up in a maelstrom over the next
year or two? At the risk of sounding Pollyanna-ish, I'm grateful for the sweet memories
and for all these dear folks.

This year's 'Zoomgiving' was more pleasant than expected. Even though I was solo, I
rallied for the holiday cooking (cranberry chutney, jalapeno corn bread, balsamic glazed
brussel sprouts, sweet potato casserole, apple crostata w/homemade whipped cream,
while Michael was kind enough to bring over some delicious turkey, which I traded him
for sides). And it was warming to zoom with Ben and Sammi, Ethan and his family, Mom
and Arnold (and Michael, briefly). Ben and Sammi cooked up a feast themselves
(featuring lamb from a Park Slope butcher) and are starting their own traditions. L'dor
vador. Physically, I was feeling ok -- I'm still quite tired from the cumulative effects of
chemo/low hemoglobin. I may even have been feeling better a year ago on the holiday
when we were at Michael and Sue's; I was undergoing chemo but had not yet had my
second operation (fistula repair). But I'm alive, and for that I'm thankful. A friend who is a
'wine person' brought over four bottles of wine for me to sample! Kind of him. I'm still
working my way through the white Bordeaux, which is delicious, and paired perfectly
with the turkey. Another friend brought over a French apple tart, made by her daughter.
And I received lots of texts and emails from friends and family - thank you for them.
To my surprise, even after all the cooking, I didn't sleep well Thanksgiving night. My
mind starts going down paths where I remember things from the past and begin really
digging into all the crevices. I've been leaning into memories quite heavily during this
era of COVID and cancer, and sometimes they keep me up at night. A couple of wakeful
hours, then, were spent mentally writing the story of a memorable Thanksgiving from my
past, which Ben said he wanted me to tell him sometime. So Ben, this one's for you (and
for all of you who wish to read!).
Une Fête de Thanksgiving à nulle autre pareille
Dear Ben,
In 1984 I was exactly the age you are now, twenty-five. Like you, I was in graduate
school at NYU, in the third year of my doctoral program in French Studies. Yet unlike you,
I was living not in Brooklyn but in Paris, attending classes at French universities. Your
‘aunties’ Vinni and Shanny, and I, shared an apartment in the rue Vineuse, a pleasant
street near the place du Trocadéro in Passy, a very upper crust, fairly snobbish
neighborhood in western Paris, to which many upwardly-mobile Parisians had flocked in
the nineteenth century. Unlike Park Slope where you live now, Passy was dead at night,
but during the day the long rue de Passy bustled with expensive commerce and elegant
tea salons; we felt somehow ‘fancy’ living there. How did three American graduate
students afford such tony digs, with heavy antique furnishings and a chandelier in our
living room (one day I came home to find the saucer-shaped ornaments decorating it
overflowing with water, like a fountain; our upstairs neighbor had left her bathtub
running, and compensated for the huge mess she had caused by offering us Opera
                       590 / 1.901
tickets)? Ronald Reagan was president and, although I instinctively distrusted him as a
Republican, he had done wonders for our economy: our dollar had hardly ever been
stronger abroad. Vinni, Shanny and I kept our fridge stocked with champagne, bought
jewelry, clothes (and books) with abandon, and garnered a reputation, we three 
américaines, for throwing fun, salon-like dinner parties.
Which is what we decided to do for Thanksgiving. We were missing the meals we’d be
having at home and wanted to impress our new French friends – smart, interesting and
lively young men and women about our age whom we were meeting in our classes and
elsewhere – with our culinary savoir-faire. We soon discovered, though, that fixing an
‘American’ Thanksgiving, at least in 1984 Paris, was easier said than done. First step:
where to find a turkey? Turns out, no frozen Butterballs in the supermarket. So we
headed to a butcher shop in the rue de Passy, which in November had all sorts of freshly-
killed game (pheasants, partridges, rabbits etc.) hanging from its window. Might they
also have a turkey, we inquired? The butcher went into his freezer, and returned holding
a large turkey, still covered in its feathers, by its *neck.* Our mouths dropped, but
realizing we would have no other option, we consented to return the next day to
purchase it. As we entered the butcher shop, we found the boucher singing off the
turkey’s feathers (the bird’s neck, head and feet were nowhere in sight…).
Next problem: where, oh where, to find cranberry sauce? Not the kind of product we
could find in our local supermarché and it was well before the vogue of ‘American’ style
restaurants and grocery stores in Paris. As I recall, though, we were able to procure a
few cans of sauce at Fauchon, the très chic specialty food store on the place de la
Madeleine. Perhaps a parent sent us a few other provisions? I don’t remember. Shanny
made a delicious apple pie from The Silver Palette Cookbook, although I also don’t recall
if that was the time she mistakenly added salt instead of sugar to the recipe, an epic fail.
And photographs remind me that there was also homemade pumpkin pie, corn bread
and, I think, my aunt’s cranberry, Granny Smith apple, cashew and arugula salad with a
lime vinaigrette made with extra virgin olive oil (we were in the early years of the EVOO
craze). I don’t remember the actual cooking of the dinner but Vinni and Shanny look
quite relaxed in our kitchen with our holiday turkey. As we took turns hosting dinner
parties in New York during our first two years of graduate school, we were all, by this
time, budding cooks (like you!) who enjoyed getting creative in the kitchen.
I have to imagine that our friends enjoyed our feast. The photos remind me that we had
our apéro in the heavily-draped living room before moving into the dining room for
dinner. Around the table we gathered Shanny’s always smartly-dressed friends Joel and
Annick, a woman I don’t recognize and François, the then boyfriend (later to be husband,
then ex-husband) of our dear friend Doris. I don’t remember if anyone else attended.
I don’t seem to have a picture of me at dinner. That’s probably because, just like today, I
was the one documenting the event with my camera. So here’s a picture of your mom at
                       591 / 1.901
one of our other dinner parties, with a very nice guy named Didier, whom we met
through other friends. Didier was just starting a successful career in the French
administration; I see now that he's the CEO of a major European energy company. I have
no idea why there is a big bottle of Italian Strega on the table next to me; it’s not
something I usually drink. Perhaps I had bought it when visiting my father in Venice the
month before? As you can see, Shanny, Vinni and I loved buying clothes and jewelry in
Paris (that strong US dollar!) and we seem to all have been accessorizing w/faux pearls
and other types of bling for the occasion (I was wearing this low-waisted scarlet velvet
dress that I adored). I wonder what Didier was saying that was making me laugh?
If this whets your appetite for more stories, another time I will tell you about our landlady
in the rue Vineuse, foreign-born Madame Rose (who constantly got her French pronouns
mixed up and who, after many months, revealed to me that she was Jewish; fearing anti-
Semitism [?], she always told us cryptically and in hushed tones, when planning a trip to
Israel, that “je vais à la campagne”). Or I’ll tell you the one about my upstairs neighbor in
Mme Rose’s building. Of all the buildings in Paris, how did the son of my mother’s best
friend, Jon Harber, whom I had babysat when he was little, wind up in mine during his
study abroad semester and turn out to be quite the partyer?

I am doing ok, probably a bit more than ok since the effects of my last IV chemo
treatment are wearing off. I am grateful for this reprieve. But now of course I'm gearing
up for my CT scan this coming Wednesday, which always makes me awfully anxious
(what have those sneaky cancer cells been up to? Lying dormant? Multiplying? Hanging
out?). The following week, I'll see Dr. Patel and likely start on Zejula, a 'parp inhibitor'
that I'll take daily for maintenance. Worst possible Scary Side Effects include certain
types of cancers, compromised bone marrow due to lowered white blood cell count etc.
So I'll be monitored closely for the first month or so, with weekly (I think) bloodwork and
daily heart rate and blood pressure checks (I'll need to get a cuff to assess my b.p.). I
hope I can handle the drug. Dr. Beavis said it was ""worth a try."" I still need to get clearer
about what she meant exactly, but I believe she meant that if it doesn't work out (ie if I
can't handle the side effects), we will simply stop the treatment. In that case, I suppose, I
hang out until I have another recurrence,  setting in motion 'third line chemo.' I am
heartened to see that a fellow Hopkins patient I have come to know via Facebook,
recently given a discouraging prognosis, has had a very good result with Zejula, and her
CA 125 number has gone down.  This gives me hope.
Meanwhile, we're gearing up for the last week of the semester and then exam week. As
my graduate seminar was small, my workload will be manageable, but I have a small
slew of other tasks to complete before we break for roughly a month around Dec. 18th.
Sometimes I honestly can't believe I accomplished all I did this semester in terms of
teaching and administering -- sadly, not in terms of research but I have high hopes for
winter break, as finishing up an article that just needs a bit more work before I can send
it off. Ben will come home for a week in early January! As for me, I'll likely stay put,
waiting out the COVID storm. But sorely tempted by that loft apartment on W. 15th
street that cousin is offering to lend me while she and her husband are holed up at their
country home in Hudson.
*****
But let's turn to something more pleasant, shall we? Having read my account of our Paris
Thanksgiving in 1984, Vinni jogged my memory in an important way, reminding me that
we hosted not one but *two* Thanksgiving dinners that year (this was corroborated by
her [future] husband, Steve, who was also studying abroad in Paris in 1984-1985);
presumably we could not fit the entire membership of our growing coterie around our
table and our French friends were clamoring for a taste of an 'authentic' American
holiday. Since Vinni and I brought our memories into focus via text a few days ago, I
have unearthed another crucial piece of evidence in my 'private archives' (one of my
most prized possessions): an aérogramme to my mother and brother describing the
                       601 / 1.901
event itself! Here's what I wrote on 1 December 1984:
Dear Mom & E,
It was so nice to talk to you on Thanksgiving. I hope you had a nice holiday - tell me
about it. As I told you, our (2) Thanksgiving dinners were a great success. I guess turkeys
are pretty exotic here - the butcher had to de-plume them, cut off head, limbs, clean
them - in front of us - he seemed to enjoy that! We stuffed them (chestnut and olive
stuffing), made mashed sweets (I invented a recipe), corn bread, green beans in
bechamel sauce, cranberry salad, gravy + pumpkin pie + apple pie. Cranberries +
pumpkin could only be found at Fauchon, the fanciest specialty store. Thursday night, we
invited Doris and her boyfriend François, 2 friends of Shanny's (Joël + Annick), a friend of
Vinni's. Friday night William and his brother Jérôme + 2 friends from school, Sam +
Steve -- that was a lot of fun but a big job. I really sympathize with you, Mom - I don't
know how you made all those dinners for so many people!
A photo(on the back of which I've written ""Thanksgiving 84 - (Very) rarely am I
surrounded by so many men,"" reveals our dinner guests that second evening. Left to
right: Sam Thorsen, a friend of ours from the Institute of French Studies at NYU, yours
truly, Steve Bold, another friend from NYU French Department; two French brothers
whom we had met through our friend Isabelle (I think). Shanny had a thing for Jérôme
(Brother 1), an ultra-smart young intello now a media studies prof at Tel-Aviv University.
I had had a thing for (and with, in New York) William (Brother 2), an equally brilliant and
articulate young attorney, now a prominent human rights lawyer, but in Paris we were
just buddies. Vinni and Steve wound up marrying (as did Doris and François), but the
sparks (unless I missed something?) were not yet flying in 1984. Sam was a dear soul
and a bit of a lost soul, struggling with his coming out at a time when many gay men still
remained closeted. He had a lovely Georgia drawl (he hailed from Savannah) and was
droll and a great companion and confidant. One night around midnight I heard pebbles
hitting my bedroom window; Sam was in the street below (our genteel
Passy quartier was deserted at night), stumbling and calling up: Willlaaaa! Willlaaa!
(think Stanley Kowalski bellowing: ""Stellaaa! Stelllaa!).  He came upstairs and sort of
crumpled in my living room, smelling of sweat and alcohol and cigarettes. I think I just
held him, or I like to think I did.  We lost him to AIDS in 1991.
I'm wearing a fabulous deep navy velvet jacket with ornate beading that I had found in
one of my grandmother's closets in her brownstone on E. 94th street. I loved to
rummage through her dozens of hatboxes, jewelry cases and fifth floor closets to find
hidden treasures (once I found a $20 bill crumpled up in the toe of an old pair of ice
skates), such as this very 1940s looking jacket (boxy padded shoulders), which I liked to
wear low-cut, loosely pinned up and tightly belted. I think I look pretty happy here,
tottering between a gamine and a slightly hot mess, surrounded by the guys. I still have
the jacket but the purple net lining is all torn and the beading is coming undone. May be
                       602 / 1.901
time to have it repaired.

167,"Everything went as smoothly as possible with my CT scan this morning (routine scan
following three rounds of IV chemo), although it's certainly not fun. I had to wake up at
the ungodly hour of 7 a.m. (I know, I know), which might have been tolerable had I not
been so very tired from hosting a zoom speaker event the night before in my graduate
seminar on the Dreyfus Affair. I was so beat afterwards that I barely had the energy to
prop myself up on my couch, eat a bowl of tomato tortellini soup, and watch reruns of
""Beat Bobby Flay.""
(One of) the worst part(s) of the entire scan experience (there are several) is the
interdiction against food and drink for four hours beforehand. This might not be an issue
if I didn't wake up every morning feeling so thoroughly dehydrated. In any event, per
usual, I had to drink two large bottles of contrast liquid on arrival. The revolting taste of
the barium (resembling greasy melted chalk) initially made me gag, then I willed myself
into pretending that it was a fine Châteauneuf-du-Pape or equivalent, going so far as to
softly intone to myself ""Mmmm...."" after each rotten swig.  The rotgut swilling took about
two hours while the scan itself went fairly quickly. I know most of the technicians by now
and they're quite nice. The unpleasant aspect of the scan itself is receiving an additional
contrast dye via IV, which nearly instantly fills my mouth with a nauseating warm
salty/metallic taste. I threw up twice at Hopkins when being pumped with this stuff so
                       607 / 1.901
now I always ask to hold onto a container of which I can avail myself if I feel the urge.
And that was my morning. 
I popped into Wegman's to pick up a few items after I left the medical center, then
treated myself to a large cappuccino at the Pump Station Café. When I returned home I
lay down for an hour or so as I felt wiped out.
I managed to make a dent in my backlog of emails in the afternoon  while pinging and
ponging back and forth on the phone between the pharma company that will be
delivering my new oral chemo med (Zejula) and the company supplying me with a card
to reduce my copay. During about three of these calls I was (still) told that my copay per
month would be $1800 -- which produces the effect of being stunned with a cattle prod
or laser each time I hear it. My patience was really wearing thin as I was tired. By the
end of the day, though, word had arrived that my copay, thanks to this miracle card, will
indeed be $0 (thank goodness for small miracles). Good news. Less good news: I must be
home from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. to sign for my medicine whenever it's delivered. I can
handle that. Question mark: Will I be able to tolerate this new medication? Will it wreak
havoc on my body? Bigger question mark: what will my scan show? Maybe I'll find out
tomorrow. Or maybe not until I see Dr. Patel next Thursday. Or maybe sooner, via the
radiologists at either Geisinger or Hopkins. So....much...uncertainty.
I dreamt last night that I was in a crowded public place, indoors (perhaps a wedding that
I had been invited to or that I was at least viewing, although I wasn't dressed formally).
Yet it appeared that everyone there (not just the wedding guests but crowds of people
walking in or near the indoor venue) had tacitly decided, collectively, to no longer wear
masks. I was alarmed by this, not really panicked but surprised and worried.  COVID-era
dreams... And then this morning I was swigging my greasy melted chalk (I hear 2020 was
a notable vintage) when I realized that this entailed my taking off my mask, indoors, for
the duration of the swigging -- and that made me a bit nervous. And then this morning,
too, I read a long NYTimes article about how hospitals, especially outside urban areas
(Altoona, PA, was mentioned), are full to maximum capacity with COVID patients. MUST

So blessed to have been brought to this season and therefore to be able to recite the
Schehecheyanu. Last year I was in D.C. for part of Chanukah, or perhaps just afterwards,

Lenox, MA, w/grad school bffs Vinni, Isabelle and Shanny, reveling in a memorable,
wonderful reunion (and in delicious, healthy food, lots of yoga, and spa treatments!).
Those pre-pandemic days seem far away..
Dr. Patel had a cancellation this morning so I was able to talk to him about both my scan
results and my upcoming regimen of Zejula. He spent about 45 minutes with me and I
was grateful for his time.
The results of my scan seem not much changed from the last time (September), which is
certainly not bad news. No new masses, nothing pertinent in my lymph nodes to report,
no new findings of significance. There is a 1.1 cm 'structure' in my right pelvis that was
also noted in September that is at present 'indeterminate.' It might be nothing or it
might be something. The doctors will keep an eye on it. A PET scan may have showed
more but Dr. Patel explained to me these have to be 'rationed' as after a certain point
the insurance company won't cover them :(. So the CT scan was the fallback this time
around. He says he spends hours on end w/the insurance companies trying to advocate
for his patients, often to no avail... Healthcare coverage in America - don't get me
started...
I need to have a routine port flush the final week in December.
And next week I'm to start on Zejula (my plan is to start next Friday after an important
professional presentation that I need to be in good shape for; Dr. P. said this was fine
and I have the medication on hand). We went over some of the (numerous) potential
side effects. The one that he is anticipating concerns my blood counts; they are likely to
drop (both hemoglobin and white blood count). Dr. P's office will be testing my blood
often (once weekly for the first month, then once monthly) and I'll need to monitor my
blood pressure and heart rate at home (I'll purchase a wristband that can measure both).
In anticipation of some of these side effects, I'll be starting off on 200 rather than 300
mgs daily. As he can be rather brusque sometimes, Dr. Patel seemed a bit impatient with
all my questions. While I explained that they stem in part from anxiety, he encouraged
me to not get bent out of shape over things I cannot control (generally sound advice),
reasoning that we'll deal with my particular symptoms and reactions (should I have any)
once I start on the medications. He even conjectured -- somewhat jokingly? -- that the
reason I may be fatigued is because I have so many questions (and hence worries)
swirling through my brain. Lest you think he is too abrupt, let me underscore that in the
end I have come to appreciate his 'no nonsense' approach and practicality as well as his
skills as an oncologist. I've definitely grown to trust him in the year and a half or so since
I've been his patient.
So here's the bottom line, per Dr. Patel's 'straight talk express:' a)given how very ill I was
                       610 / 1.901
last April, and the seriousness of my cancer, I'm currently doing as well as can be
expected. And that's a blessing; b)the parp inhibitor has the potential to buy me some
time. And whether that be a month or a year, I'll be grateful for it; c)""Enjoy your life, and
don't focus on things you can't control. Do things you enjoy."" ""I am enjoying it, that's
why I don't want it to end!"" Sounds good to me.

                       613 / 1.901
them. It seems evident to me that I repressed the final point:
1)By many measures, I'm doing better than I was in April-May of last year, when I was
first diagnosed and had the mother of all debulking surgeries.
2)Zejula (and other parp inhibitors) have been shown to work better in women with the
BRCA mutation, which I do not have. However, a number of studies have shown (and Dr.
Beavis even sent me an article on this from a medical journal) that parp inhibitors can
also prolong life in patients without the BRCA mutation, which is my case, who have
advanced recurrent ovarian cancer (my case too). Hence her assessment that Zejula is
""worth a try."" I'm game.
3)Dr. Patel cannot at this point endorse my receiving the anti-COVID vaccine. As yet
there are no FDA nor other guidelines for the (safe) administration of this vaccine to
cancer patients, no hard knowledge, as far as I understand it, about potential side
effects, potentially risky drug interactions etc. So instead of being closer to the front of
the line I appear to be, at this moment, at the back of the line, perhaps not even in line.
What a disappointment, and yet another example of how COVID has been extra-
challenging for those of us with cancer, for myriad reasons [insert long list here]. But
there's nothing I can do about it except receive the vaccine against my oncologist's
advice, and I don't think I'm willing to take that risk. And hopefully guidance from 'the
authorities' will be forthcoming before too long. I'm sure the small army of us cancer
patients/survivors will demand it!",4,neutral,0.43358415,0.0077473903,0.013412385,0.010621774,0.01748234,0.43358415,0.4239778,0.09317413

Just a short note to ask everyone to direct some healing energy my way as I start on my
new chemo regimen tomorrow morning. I'll take 300 mg of Zejula daily, in the form of
two pills. I spoke at some length with the Geisinger pharmacist (or perhaps she was a
nurse?) who will be working with Dr. Patel to oversee my 'day to day' during this
regimen. For example, she will likely review (weekly, then monthly) results of blood work
with me, make sure my blood pressure is not out of bounds, and check in on me
regularly. Since I am most nervous about the potential side effects, she confirmed that
the likeliest of these will be fatigue; high blood pressure (which might manifest itself as
dizziness, nausea); and lowering of white and red blood cell counts. I bought a cuff with
which to measure my blood pressure and heart rate and hope it will work well (and that I
will work it well). I have nausea meds. My local pals are on call. And fortunately I've just
about finished my grading (awaiting one straggler...) and have a few weeks off before
spring semester starts on Jan. 19th. So I can sleep in, eat well (I see soup making in my
future), take walks (although I'm really cold-averse!) and replenish. Above all, I'll keep in
mind that each pill is potentially prolonging my life. That will provide motivation, but if
the side effects impact my quality of life too negatively, I will need to rethink.
In grad school, I had a professor named Jindrich Zezula and I can't help thinking of him
each time I reach for the Zejula!
A highlight of the weekend was a somewhat impromptu Rezoomion with about eighteen
former housemates from Currier House, the Harvard residence where I lived, loved,
cried, partied, studied, danced, made friends, and learned lots of valuable life lessons
over forty years ago. The impetus for the reunion was a photo I posted on Facebook of
my Currier-mate David Gifford and me reconnecting in Paris several years ago at a fairly
swanky café/bistrot across from the Parc Monceau (David was served the most gigantic
mille-feuilles known to man; restaurant patrons were staring at it, agape; David, who had
just arrived from Japan, downed most of it after the two of us had indulged in an equally
decadent, buttery slab of paté de foie gras with some delicious large crystals of salt
sprinkled on it). A few comments on this photo led David, my friend Chris Ahmadjian and
I to put together the reunion, which was a lot of fun! It was a two-hour nostalgia trip,
which jogged my memory about certain forgotten details: that *tree* in the middle of the
Currier House dining room (apparently no longer there); the grill where we bought cheap
and greasy late-night snacks to fortify our studying; that resident pre-med tutor who was
also a skilled musician; and oh yes, x really was dating y. Those were good (although
angst-ridden) days and I'm grateful to still have some of my Currier friends along for the
ride.
Was also happy to zoom with my mother and then my aunt, who both celebrated
birthdays this week (my mother's 84th and her sister Marlene's 87th! - the Medjuck
women are schooling their kids and grandkids in graceful longevity). And to zoom with
                       617 / 1.901
Ben of course - he'll be here for a week in early January and I'm sure lots of cooking will
take place.
I was also a discussant Friday afternoon during a conversation with an author about her
new book (concerning women collectors of Japanese art in the late 19th c.). This zoom
event was organized by a professional society I belong to (Nineteenth-Century French
Studies) and attracted about 100 people. I had not 'presented' in this type of setting
since my diagnosis and was glad to realize that I hadn't lost my mojo. It was a lot of fun,
the kind of professional activity I revel in, although truth be told I was very tired
afterwards.

Day 3 on Zejula and I'm happy to report no notable ill effects so far. I've experienced
some mild nausea but a pill helped with that. My energy level has been fine; after a full
day yesterday I whipped up three cranberry orange nut breads. So far my bp and pulse
are normal; Zejula can notoriously trigger high blood pressure. As for my blood counts
(Zejula can also notoriously make red and white blood cell counts plummet, in rare cases
causing blood cancers), I'll know more when I have my blood tested on Monday and then
once a week thereafter for the first month. It is possible that the side effects of Zejula
don't manifest until one has been taking it for awhile (I don't know that for a fact, I'm just
imagining). Yet Dr. Beavis told me that she currently has a patient who has experienced
no side effects from Zejula, except for mild fatigue in the beginning - this is encouraging.
For now, I pray that I will continue to feel generally well. Sure beats IV chemo so far.
I may have mentioned that I likely can't get vaccinated against COVID yet. Both my
oncologists tell me that there is not enough data to know how it might affect cancer
patients currently in treatment. I hope that soon more will be known but for now I have
to remain very patient -- and very careful, especially if my white blood cells are
suppressed.
I turned my grades in on Monday and put the semester to rest. Ecstatic to have a bunch
of days of completely unstructured time. I've been writing holiday cards, a relaxing
yearly ritual. Tomorrow I'll probably write them while listening to to traditional Christmas
hymns, which I love even though I don't observe Christmas. I like the 19th century ones
like ""O Come, O Come Emmanuel,"" sung by a splendid choir like that of King's College,
Cambridge, or medieval or Renaissance hymns and carols. Such meditative, soulful,
trancelike music and words. Also enjoyed a long phone call and a Zoom chat with two
different friends (plus a long Zoom with my aunt), and watched cooking shows on t.v.
Speaking of which, I think my next read will be David Chang's new memoir, _Eat a
Peach._
Also went to my hair stylist's, where Joe (the owner) worked wonders. He's been
compassionate and discreet all along, crafting a short bob for me when my hair was
starting to fall out last year. It's taken a good year, but now my hair is back in earnest!
It's still short but feels healthy and I have some curls in the back for the first time in my
life (it grew in that way). There's enough length now that Joe was actually able to style it,
freeing me from the bizarre-looking mop of hair I've been sporting (and disguising with
cute headbands, scarves, clips etc.) as my hair inched (or rather centimetered) its way
back.
I was so happy with the effect of this cut hat I posted my pic on a Facebook page I joined

Some days I feel like I am thriving, others striving, others yet merely surviving. Today
began with 'surviving,' but improved as the day went on. Zejula, as predicted, is messing
with my blood pressure. The diastolic bp number has been inching upwards all week, to
the point where this morning it seemed alarming to me based on the range I had been
told was normal (it turns out that that range has recently been expanded, unbeknownst
to me, one of the many confusions of my day). Should I go to the ER (a place, by the
way, which I wish to avoid like the plague)? Am I adjusting the bp cuff correctly? Should I
take my bp again (I did this three times in succession, yielding very different results each
time, which only made me more anxious)? I lay down on my bed for a while, curled into a
fetal position, then texted my brother who, as he habitually does, provided some
sensible input and helped calm me down (thank you, Ethan). I then decided the optimal
path would be to call the pharmacist to whom Dr. Patel is handing off this part of my
care (anything to do w/my Zejula regimen); she works with him and specializes in oral
chemo drugs. But she is frustratingly hard to reach: each time I call I need to go through
a long phone tree, only to be put on hold and leave a voice mail each time. I can also
contact her through Dr. Patel's nurse's mailbox in the Geisinger portal, but not directly
through the portal. Complicated! I also decided to see if one of Dr. Patel's nurses would
check my blood pressure when I had my bloodwork done at Scenery Park; that was
quickly agreed to. In the meantime, I did receive emails from the pharmacist basically
telling me not to worry, that the bp was still normal (whereas she had told me to go to
the ER if my diastolic bp number was over 100, now she was telling me that both
numbers, upper and lower, needed to be in abnormal range for there to be cause for
concern).
 
When I went to get my blood taken, the technician had no idea how much blood to draw
and for which tests; there were no notes about that in my chart. Oh. This problem took a
little while to get sorted out. Then I went downstairs to Dr. Patel's office, where Regina,
one of the nurses, checked my blood pressure, which she found to be normal, but when
we tried twice more with my cuff we again got very different results, one of which
seemed very high. Dr. Patel was not in the office and Kayla (the nurse who assists him
and sort of oversees all the other nurses) was tied up. So I had no one to voice my
frustration to except Regina, telling her that I felt I wasn't being well cared for at the
moment and worrying out loud if I was going to have a heart attack. I had all sorts of
                       626 / 1.901
questions about my bp that she couldn't answer. Normally I probably would have burst
into tears at that point but as I'm on Lexapro so my affect is pretty flat much of the time.
Probably for the best.
I was sort of turned around when I got home (c. 2:30) -- I had had great plans to dive
back into my research today -- so I just lay on my bed for a while and read. Anna (the
pharmacist) called me and imparted some welcome news: my bloodwork looks good!
The Zejula has laid off my red and white blood cells and platelets for now. She also
reiterated that I shouldn't worry about my bp (which of course stress can cause to
elevate) and that they'd be concerned about consistently high numbers (ie over a three-
day period) - that was news to me, but ok, good. She also said that her protocol was to
call me once a week to go over everything, leaving me a bit concerned about who I
should contact if I felt anxious or if something acute transpired. I don't think she gave me
a direct answer but she did make clear (albeit nicely, even overly nicely) that it shouldn't
be her.
A message from a friend in France arrived au bon moment and motivated me to look at a
project that we might collaborate on, so I reread most of the manuscript (140 pages), my
transcription of a fascinating unpublished diary from 1878 set mainly against the
backdrop of the Opera and the Opera ballet as well as the Paris World's Fair of that year.
While rereading was fairly 'low hanging fruit,' it did get me reconnected to my work and I
look forward to continuing tomorrow. And it kind of got my off-kilter day back on track.
The crappy day further redeemed itself when an unexpected bouquet of bright yellow
flowers in a vase was delivered -- sent by someone at Penn State who is thoughtful, kind
and humane. It was *exactly* what I needed and brightened my day considerably. I felt
the anxiety I had been holding all day start to dissipate.
On another note, I am still writing holiday cards! If you haven't received one from me yet
(especially if you were kind enough to send me one), I am still working on them. They'll
be more like New Year's cards this year. 
Hope I'll be back to thriving soon. I'd even be ok w/striving.

175,"....and did I mention a roller coaster?
Dr. Beavis (my wonderful gyn-onc from Hopkins) just called w/the Hopkins' radiologists
reading of my recent CT scan. From a cancer perspective, things look overall good.
There's some 'nodularity' in my pelvis that they are watching. But the radiologists also
saw what they believe to be two tiny blood clots, one in my lung, one in my leg. The
Geisinger radiologists here in State College had not picked that up. That was of course
concerning because of the danger of an embolism. So I have to (re)start Lovanox (blood
                       630 / 1.901
thinner), twice a day, by injection (ie I inject myself - not fun, but I know how to do it).
This should take care of the problem, and the clot will be absorbed back into my
bloodstream. The radiologists recommended that I have another CT scan now to see
whether the clots have changed in size etc. but Dr. Beavis felt we should proceed
straight to treatment. The clots' formation is cancer-related. 
In other news, I'll take the Zejula as long as my CA125 number is stable. If it starts to rise
that could indicate a recurrence. Dr. Beavis reminded me that if a second recurrence is
to occur, it usually does so after the same interval as the first recurrence. In my case this
was barely six months. However, she reminded me that all the problems related to the
fistula could well have been an aggravating factor. So we'll see. We agreed that we will
cross that bridge when/if we come to it. In the meantime, the plan is to enjoy every day.
In better news, she now thinks that I should be able to receive the COVID vaccine when it
becomes available to me. The oncology community is hoping that there will be CDC
guidelines regarding the vaccine and cancer patients, but it is not available yet.
Voilà. Never a dull moment.",4,neutral,0.68127227,0.009590287,0.024060003,0.039724,0.006475695,0.68127227,0.18256685,0.056310847
176,"Last year on this date I enjoyed a coffee outside with my friend Jeff at Café La Colombe
in Blagden Alley (D.C.) on a sunny day, then snagged Ethiopian takeout from a great
place near Ben's former apartment before hunkering down at his place for a peaceful
evening watching t.v. and chilling while he and Sammi were in New York. The next day I
took a commuter train to Baltimore in the hopes of having a fistula between my
abdomen and intestine 'plugged' at Hopkins, thereby eliminating the need for a second
open surgery. When I awoke from that procedure (I was under light anesthesia), Dr.
Holley (an interventional radiologist) said to me: ""It didn't work. I'm sorry. There's
something else going on. There's nothing more I can do for you.""
The failure of this procedure next led to my having a second major open surgery in
March, to repair the fistula (and snip out other pieces of my intestine and colon in the
process). That operation, which lasted about nine hours I believe, went well. A few days
into my recovery, the news channels started to be blanketed by coverage of COVID and
the slew of emergency measures being put in place in NY and elsewhere. It was
alarming. The next day, out a window near my room in the hospital, Ben and I began
seeing Hopkins employees in full Hazmat suits stopping each vehicle arriving at the
hospital, for questioning. The day after that, the hospital barred all visitors , so my
mother and Ben could no longer spend time with me. And the day after that, the surgeon
who had performed my operation, Dr. Sandy Fang, came into my room and said: ""You
seem to be doing pretty well and it turns out we're going to need the beds."" I was
discharged the next day.
As some point not long after that, my cancer recurred, which is to be expected with
ovarian cancer. I had been NED (no evidence of disease) for barely six months, which is
sort of the tipping point between what is considered a quick recurrence and a 'not quick'
one (there are technical terms for this but I can't recall them right now); the time lapse
before a first recurrence can be a predictor for the timing or 'rhythm' of subsequent
recurrences.
                       632 / 1.901
And that was only the first few months of the year..
I won't dwell on how the COVID-cancer double whammy made for a second 'annus
horribilis' in a row for me and I won't enumerate the many many things - activities,
places, travels, people, sensations, routines -- I miss, just like everyone else.
Instead, I choose to focus on the bright spots. There were indeed a few:
*March-August: The day I was discharged from the hospital in March, Ben drove me back
to State College -- and didn't leave for five months. A while after that, Sammi came to
join him/us. Both of them teleworked from here, using both my home and Michael and
Sue's as office and living space. Thankfully, we had plenty of room to accommodate
them. My memories from that time are of trying out lots of new recipes for our convivial
meals (and not having to clear or wash the dishes!), working on jigsaw puzzles, sprucing
up my house thanks to both Ben and Sammi's input re new furniture (and their skill in
assembling some pieces), long talks about everything, including the unprecedented time
we were living through, and just a deep sense of comfort from being together. Grateful
for this unusual yet wonderful interlude, that spanned late winter, spring and summer,
and for my COVID 'roommates.'
*June: The Stride and Thrive fundraiser for the Kelly Gynecological Oncology Center at
Hopkins was both uplifting and rewarding. Our State College team (perhaps 15 of us,
including Ben and his buddies,) 'strode'  around the Military Museum trail (or ran a 5K)
on a glorious June morning, wearing the #willapower t-shirts I had made for the
occasion. Better yet, I raised over $7K for KEGOS! The event is usually held in Baltimore
and I'm hoping to be sufficiently 'thriving' for a reprise of this year's performance! Who's
with me?
An offshoot of Stride and Thrive has been a  monthly get-together with up to seven
wonderful women friends, some of whom participated in the June walk. We meet at the
Military Museum early on a Sunday morning to the sound of nearby church bells, walk,
chat, catch up and finish with a coffee at a nearby café.
*August (or was it July?): Wonderful trip to Chatham, MA, with Ben for a week of pool
lounging, reading, lobster roll eating, spa going, and relaxing. The change of scene was
so welcome after months of cabin fever, I was feeling well, and the long drive to/from the
Cape in my new car was part of the adventure, as we listened to lots of music and
podcasts (one about the genesis of Bob Dylan songs). I love nothing better than a fun
road trip with a great travel companion, and this one was memorable.
*August-December: I enjoyed being back in the (virtual) classroom for the first time in
over a year and hope the graduate students learned as much as I did from our seminar
on the Dreyfus Affair.
                       633 / 1.901
*The brightest spot this year, again, was the astounding kindness shown me throughout
the year by family and friends. My family has been extraordinarily caring, not just
because they are family and they love me but because they are, I've concluded,
exceptional people that I'm lucky enough to be related to! Friends from all phases of my
life continued to email, text, call, zoom, cook, make me laugh, read and comment on my
blog, lend an ear, give advice, and help keep my spirits up in countless other ways. 
I want to especially thank those friends (and of course family members) who have not
feared, consistently, to step into the 'ring of fire,' as I call it, ie the darkest moments, the
reports after scans and procedures, the times when I'm in physical pain, the emotionally
and mentally fraught periods, the messy places. I understand how unpleasant and
frightening this can be and how it might easily trigger an avoidance mechanism.  But the
ring of fire is a ring of light! For those of you who have 'gone there' with me, I hope you
might feel, like I do, that there have been moments of grace in the face of extreme
vulnerability, raw human connection, and love. Thank you for having the *courage* to
make your life and mine a blessing.
From the existential to the mundane: today I feel pretty well. I woke up early (for me) as
I thought a repair man was coming (he can't come until Monday, it turns out), stocked up
on groceries for Ben's visit, picked up some wine for a dish I'm making, stopped at Tait
Farm and lastly for a cappuccino. I'm adjusting -- I think -- to the new oral chemo
regimen + taking my blood pressure (showing normal readings now) + giving myself two
injections each day + figuring out how to deal with the insomnia Zejula can cause (I slept
pretty well last night). I am content to have a quiet night at home with a movie (I
watched ""Dawn Wall"" last night, a gripping documentary about free soloing) and a nice
dinner (I'm thinking linguine in lemon cream sauce). These days I try to 'dedramatize'
NYE, plus I have Ben's visit to look forward to on Sunday!
Wishing everyone good health, happiness, personal prosperity, creativity, laughs, and
blessings in the new year. 
***********************************************
And this is what I wrote a year ago today:
Happily ensconced in Ben's bedroom in the row house where he lives on M Street,
overlooking the small housing project and the huge white church that takes up almost a
city block (the United House of Prayer for All People of the Church of the Rock of the
Apostolic Faith). Ben and Sammi are in NYC for NYE, but I am here, cozily on this mild
day, winding down the year (and decade). My friend/ex-bf Jeff met me for a while to
select some goodies at Buttercream Bakery, before sitting outside in the sun at La
Colombe cafe in Blagden Alley, catching up and trading tales as we like to do (see pic).
                       634 / 1.901
Headed to Baltimore at some point tomorrow. The PET-CT scan on Thursday, the results
of which I will discuss that day with the interventional radiologist (Dr. Holly), will
determine whether the procedure to repair my fistula laparoscopically can go forward
the next day. If the scan reveals significant fluid collection, for example (that niggling
stomach abscess...), the procedure may well be off, to be replaced by an open surgery at
another date. There are no guarantees. I hope for the best outcome, but need to be
prepared for a different one. I am not certain if the PET will also screen for any new or
residual cancer, but I presume it will. I'll also meet with my gyn onc, Dr. Beavis, on
Thursday afternoon.
In no way has cancer been a 'blessing,' in no way am I 'grateful' for having this disease.
In no way do I feel that ""God does not give you more than you can handle"" and/or
""everything happens for a reason."" I understand that this counters the belief of several
religious traditions that find value in suffering. In no way was spending the night before
my 'mother of all surgeries' retching into a garbage can in my hotel room while my
family looked on helplessly a redeeming experience, nor was the crushing post-chemo
fatigue that had me waking up from seventeen-hour slumbers in a stunned stupor, nor
was feeling so overwhelmed I could scarcely make myself a cup of tea, nor was the fact
of missing at least three friends' weddings and a long-planned trip to France with Ben,
nor was having my entire life come crashing down around me, leaving me to grapple
with the possibility of a shorter than hoped-for lifespan.
And yet...
I will simply echo the measured words of my rabbi, David Ostrich, during a visit he paid
me shortly after I returned home from my three-week post-surgery stay at Hopkins: ""You
may find that this experience offers some opportunity for learning:""
*I am stronger than I thought, both physically and mentally. It surprised me to learn that
some cancer patients, even at early stages of their treatment, feel they simply can't
continue with it. Except for a few rare instants when feeling particularly debilitated and
overwhelmed, this has never been my attitude. I'm still feeling well enough, and tough
enough now, to say ""bring it on."" I will keep fighting if need be (and it may very well be,
given the likelihood of a recurrence...)
*Goodness exists, and it is powerful. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, and while fully
conscious of the fact that evil, ugliness, and mean-spiritedness also exist in spades
(examples too numerous to mention here, and in our faces every day), let me quote
Anne Frank: ""It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and
impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people
are truly good at heart."" One friend brought me a hamsa (protective hand symbol) that
her mother had blessed at the Kotel in Jerusalem; another came by my house to check
on me when Ben and Michael were worried because they couldn't contact me (I was
                       635 / 1.901
deep into one of the aforementioned post-chemo big sleeps); another prepared a picnic
and drove me to sit beside a calming creek on a gorgeous summer day; another drove
me, twice, from State College to Baltimore; three others came to spend weekends with
me, to help out with whatever was needed; others ran errands, made chicken noodle
soup, borscht, quiche, rice pudding (the prodigious Meal Train kept me fed for months...),
texted, called, emailed, sent cards, gorgeous floral arrangements, and other thoughtful
gifts (one friend, envisioning me in a hospital gown, sent a colorful, elegant scarf),
prayed, visited, drove me to doctors' appointments, slept over when I was feeling shaky,
sat with me during chemo, brought me milkshakes when that was virtually all I could
stomach, invited me on outings as I continued to improve, took care of everything I left
hanging at work when I had to schedule surgery on short notice, added encouraging and
perceptive comments to this page. My family members have continued to provide rock
solid love and support, accompanying me to Baltimore, providing strong arms to lean on
when my post-surgery 'walks' extended to the house next door, and keeping up a
courageous front despite their fear. ETC. Goodness is restorative (and really beautiful
and pure!). It manifests itself in countless ways. It continues to be an essential element
in my recovery. I do feel privileged to have witnessed so many instances of grace.
Perhaps, in some ways, I have learned to be a 'better' (ie kinder, more empathic) version
of myself, too. I would be glad for that.
*As I wrote earlier about my upcoming procedure, there are no guarantees. But I think I
really understand this now. It's become easier to say ""I love you"" -- and mean it -- to
friends and family. And I hold those hugs for longer, and squeeze tighter. No filter. No
b.s. No day but today.
*I am intoxicated by life, and unready to leave it.
That's what I've learned so far.
Wishing everyone a healthy, happy, successful, fun, peaceful, loving and blessed new
year.

I haven't provided an update in a while so I just wanted to assure everyone that health-
wise things are status quo for now. The Zejula makes me slightly nauseous (in which
case I pop a Zofran) and has elevated my blood pressure a bit (but not into dangerous
territory, which is good). My last round of blood work revealed some 'renal insufficiency' -
my kidneys are working hard to flush out all the toxins and it is crucial for me to stay
hydrated. I think my liver numbers looked a bit 'wonky' as well for the same reason. I'll
have more blood work done on Tuesday, including a test targeting kidney function. On
the whole I've been sleeping better than a week or so ago, when I contended with a bout
of bad insomnia. Also somewhat troubling is a huge black and blue mark as well as quite
a few smaller ones where I've injected myself with Lovenox (blood thinner) twice daily
(I'm doing this because my last CT scan revealed two tiny blood clots, one in my lung the
other in my leg - these were *overlooked* by the Geisinger radiologists but fortunately
the Hopkins radiologists identified them). As I'm far from an expert in giving myself
shots, I am likely not doing it perfectly and it's probably causing some mild trauma to the
injection sites. When I showed my beat-up looking legs to the nurse practitioner last
week (as well as a few spots where the injection site also felt slightly swollen) she told
me it was nothing to worry about. However, tomorrow I'm going to send a picture of my
'not ready for swimsuit weather' gams to Dr. Beavis' nurse and see what she has to say.
Perhaps because of the blood thinner I'm more susceptible to bruising. More battle scars!
I was overjoyed, of course, to have Ben home this week. We had a lot of fun just hanging
out, watching a movie (""City of Gold,"" an intriguing documentary about the late LA food
critic, Jonathan Gold), taking a drive, eating nice home cooked meals etc. Wednesday we
were riveted to CNN, watching the ghastly, dismaying, unbelievable events unfold at the
Capitol. I still feel traumatized by having witnessed such desecration. Friday night I felt
compelled to try to usher in 'sabbath peace' (shabbat shalom) and to glean some Jewish
perspectives on the tragedy, so I streamed the service at Sixth & I, a well-known
progressive synagogue in D.C. The rabbi spoke about the power of the visual, of 'seeing
is believing,' comparing Moses' shock and anger at witnessing the Israelites worshipping
the Golden Calf when he descended from Mt. Sinai to the horror many of us felt faced
with such abhorrent images. We're starting the book of Exodus now: things got worse
before they got better...
In any event, Ben is here (actually at Michael's) until Tuesday and I hope to see him
briefly tomorrow. He is doing well and it was comforting to know that he was sleeping in
his 'lair' upstairs. He will meet up with Sammi for a few nights' getaway in the Poconos
before they return to Brooklyn and to work and school.
...I will be doing the same this week, getting my syllabus ready for the first week of class
(beginning the 19th) and taking care of department business, while also pressing ahead
on a writing project.
                       640 / 1.901
My monthly walk at the Military Museum w/my #willapower friends (five of us today), on
a brisk yet sunny January morning, was lovely. We were all so worked up about politics
that there was hardly time for other catch up, but that's what's preoccupying us right
now.

178,"The briefest of updates as I haven't written in a while. Our semester begins tomorrow
and I've been busy preparing while continuing to take care of department business. I'm
teaching my undergraduate course on France and the Holocaust in Film and Literature,
which is always a meaningful experience for me (and hopefully the students). No trip to
Paris over spring break in conjunction with the course this semester, however (sadly). In
fact, because of COVID concerns we don't even get a spring break this term, but three
'wellness days"" instead (I will need them, for sure).
I am feeling alright, pretty much status quo. Dr. Patel lowered my dose of Lovenox (blood
thinner) b/c it was thinning my blood too much. I am still giving myself two injections per
day in my thigh or belly, and those areas still look beat up, black and blue. I should be
                       643 / 1.901
able to switch to Coumedin or some other blood thinner soon, which can be taken orally.
I am not even sure why my oncs opted for injections now; perhaps they are more
effective. As long as they have successfully resolved the two tiny clots the CT scan
showed up.
The Zejula (oral chemo med) still makes me slightly nauseous (Zofran helps with that)
but the worse/worst side effect is insomnia, especially now that the semester is starting.
Calming music, regular bedtime routine etc. do not seem to help (but must avoid screen
time....). I'm switching to taking it in the morning in the hope that some of Zejula's
intensity may have worn off by bedtime. Grrr.
I'll have my blood checked tomorrow or W and I guess it will be time for my CA125
number to be checked too. And perhaps my kidney function too. I undergo so many
'checks' that it's honestly hard to keep track sometimes, esp. w/everything else going
on. This is where my sometimes less than stellar organization skills fail me, but I am
trying to keep on top of things. 
The title of my post today is of course the title of MLK's last book, _Where do we go from
here?: Chaos or community._ This question has been resonating with me, of course on
MLK's bday but also in light of all the recent turmoil in our country. Let's hope next time I
write we'll have a new president and VP in place, and that the transition will have been
peaceful. Good riddance to the wicked man. 
I expect to have news to share soon.
On a lighter note (see YouTube clip): Heigh-ho!",5,sadness,0.77908105,0.0034782235,0.013353019,0.02584242,0.016228437,0.15309067,0.77908105,0.008926106
179,"I have some very big news to share: in June of this year I'll be retiring from Penn State,
after thirty-three years of service.
It all started one day last semester, when I surprised myself by blurting out loudly, when
I was at home alone: ""I want to retire and move back to New York."" As this seemed a
directive shooting directly from my unconscious into my conscious state -- much like the
experience of waking up with a start from a half-dream and yelling something out loud --
I thought I should listen to that voice.
But in fact it took me months to figure out how to respond to that it. On one hand: I love
my job, adore teaching, my colleagues, my department, university settings, academic
life, walking briskly through a bustling campus as classes change, schmoozing in my
colleagues' offices. Being an academic is part of my core identity, and Penn State has
been my safe space since I was 29. 
Wouldn't it be ill-advised to give that up?
On the other: I am battling advanced ovarian cancer that may well recur (necessitating
another course of debilitating IV chemo). It's become nearly impossible for me to
marshal the necessary time and physical and emotional wherewithal needed to give
myself the best shot at maintaining the best possible quality of life for as long as
possible while carrying on the various parts of my job (teaching, research, department
headship) with the intensity and focus they deserve, and require. Stress is particularly
wearing on me as a cancer patient, as are the side effects of my medications, the many
medical appointments I must keep, the blood tests and CT/PET scans, and all the rest.
For months both my oncologists have been encouraging me to consider retirement. Dr.
                       645 / 1.901
Beavis said: ""I think it will be better for your mental health, which in turn will be better
for your physical health."" Shouldn't I give weight to the recommendations of my medical
team?
Of course, but isn't focusing my energies on a job I love and find meaningful equally
therapeutic?"" Don't many cancer patients continue to work? Can't I just 'tough it out' and
'power through' as I've been doing for decades?
In the end, I think it's time for me to be realistic about my situation. The decision,
though, was agonizing.
""...and move back to New York."" I'm not sure when I might follow through on that plan,
as the voice told me to do, but I do know that I also want to ensure that I have a ""post-
Penn State chapter"" to my life. I am aware of the odds against long-term survival of OC
(although I continue to be inspired by the stories of women who have thrived for years
with the disease, effectively beating it). The other day, I posted an envious comment on
a friend's Facebook photo of Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs in Coney Island, where my
friend had stopped for a few of those mouth-watering dogs and some fries after visiting
his mother. ""Next time you're in the city,"" he responded, ""let's meet in Coney Island and
go to Nathan's. The hot dogs will taste better there."" The luxury of spending a sunny
weekday in Coney Island with a friend -- strolling on the boardwalk, dipping my feet in
the ocean, enjoying the guilty pleasure of a dog w/kraut and extra mustard -- makes me
positively giddy with excitement. To further encourage pleasurable forward thinking, my
recently-retired friend and former colleague Monique sent me a series of tantalizing
images: a lavender field in Provence; an open-air seafood restaurant, perhaps near the
Cape, at sunset;the Eiffel Tower.
Another fear: does retiring mean that cancer has 'won,' that it eventually wore me down
to the point at which I could no longer devote myself single-mindedly to my professional
life? Or, conversely, does it mean that I am making a mindful choice to take on this
fucking disease in optimal conditions?
Of course, there is fear of the unknown, of sea change. It's in a way comparable to my
divorce (but much less traumatically so) in that the future seems a blank slate, defying
my attempts to fully envision it. It's a 'down the rabbit hole,' 'through the looking glass
moment.' But the next chapter will be mine to write (w/apologies for that trite image).
...but speaking of writing, I do intend to remain an active researcher/writer (w/more time
to devote to those pleasures), will remain at the helm of the doctoral committee that I
chair and member of several others of which I'm a member; will attend conferences and
campus events; and hope to stay connected in other ways.
I'll miss my colleagues (esp my those who are *friends*) terribly. They are my tribe.
                       646 / 1.901
Another fear: finances. over the past several months my financial advisor and I have run
the numbers several times as has my TIAA-CREF advisor. I should be more than ok,
meaning that I should have at least as much to live on per month as I do now. That's a
reassuring thought. But it's more or less a finite sum. And it's strange to imagine not
having income (although I hope some short-term teachings gigs etc. will eventually come
my way). I'm bad with budgets, and enjoy a free-spending lifestyle. I'll need to manage
my finances better, and curtail my frequent impulse buying (which should not be hard,
as I have *plenty* of everything).
I can't wait to travel again as soon as it's safe, and hope to spend more time in the city
with friends and family. I like the idea of coming full circle. I've been transfixed by
descriptions and images of the cool apartments I could rent (let's hope that the rents
stay as reasonable as they have been, due to New Yorkers leaving the city during
COVID). There's a new building on the LES (Essex Street) atop a fabulous foodie heaven
market, boasting an exercise room full of Peloton bikes and a rooftop pool. I think I could
picture myself there, on a high floor with views of the East River and the bridges. It's
magical at night.
But I'm getting ahead of myself. There will be an adjustment period I'm sure, and I'll
more than likely take ample time to downsize, purging my boxes and boxes of files, class
notes etc., and to get used to the new normal.
It's been wrenching to share the news with colleagues. Tears have been shed all around.
The Dean has been very supportive. I feel emotionally drained.
I hope I am making the right choice and that a higher power (and my own fortitude) will
grant me the good health to enjoy what lies ahead.

180,"Good health news today: my CA125 level (OC marker) is 13 this month, down from 15.7
last month. Anything over 38 may be a warning sign. I was *overjoyed* and energized to
receive this news. This means that the Zejula (chemo pill that I take daily) appears to be
working. May it continue!! In my mind ""I'm only as healthy as my last CA125 test or CT-
scan,"" but at the very least this means I have another 'reprieve' for a month. I'll take it!
The full blood panel returned numbers that are also 'stable.' That's good too. 
Tomorrow I'll get my first COVID shot at a hospital in Lewistown, about 25 miles from
here. That's another piece of good news. I will be grateful for this extra layer of
protection. Of course, I hope nothing untoward happens (eg allergic reaction), but if does
I'll be in the best possible setting to be treated.
I've been telling Penn State people little by little about my retirement. I want to tell as
many people as I can in person (albeit virtually). Today I shared the news with our
graduate students. They were extraordinarily kind, caring, and gracious. Several were
crying and others wrote me touching notes afterwards. I want to be able to be 'in the
moment' to the greatest extent possible, to be present for this outpouring of compassion
and honesty. I'm trying, but to be honest it's emotionally overwhelming, as this entire
process of decision-making and its aftermath has been.
A few more random thoughts on my retirement (I'm sure there will be others going
forward):
>It's rather a shame that I'm 'going out at the top of my game,' so to speak. I hope this
doesn't sound vain, but in many ways, I feel like I'm at the apogee of my career in terms
of expertise, skill and experience in the classroom, sharpness of critical thinking and
creativity etc. I really feel like I'm nailing it in the classroom this semester, partly out of a
desire, I suppose, to 'leave it all on the floor' before I go. I don't know if there's a causal
link, but the students seem highly engaged. Maybe I just got lucky with an excellent
class. And the Zoom format is really not bad. I learned how to use some new tools that
                       651 / 1.901
the students seem to enjoy (including one that lets the entire class annotate a document
together). Although nothing can substitute for F2F teaching, Zoom is not the horror I
imagined it might be.
Perhaps it's good, though, that I'm leaving 'at the top of my game.' As my friend Cheryl
Glenn wisely pointed out, I'm leaving on my own terms. The wheels are in motion
because of my decision. ('m being proactive (although I arguably could have made the
decision before Fall semester, for example, but clearly I wasn't ready yet). No 'epic fail'
like two springs ago, when everything fell to pieces when I was diagnosed in May 2019
and literally had to run out of the office, leaving papers and files and books strewn
everywhere, to start scrambling to get treatment set up.
>A minor point, perhaps (and completely unrelated to my last one), my financial advisor
and friend, Deb Guerrero (who has been immensely helpful during this entire period)
reminded me that my investments will continue to generate income. Financially, this is
not a zero sum game. Further reassurance that financially things should be ok for me.
>Having made my decision, I am actually starting to feel better physically (and
mentally). Perhaps it's the Zejula working its magic, but I am also simply feeling
progressively 'lighter' as I begin this countdown period (26 class sessions to go). I will
probably be a mess on the last day of class. It's all so bittersweet.
Be well, everyone and THANK YOU for the many supportive comments on my last entry
(in addition to emails and texts). I will *try* to respond to your posts if I can.",3,joy,0.97544795,0.0021215312,0.0017185953,0.001525497,0.97544795,0.01098176,0.004746035,0.0034586452

Things are basically status quo, which is a good thing, but I thought I'd give a quick
update anyway. I say' basically status quo' because I was feeling somewhat under the
weather today. I've had a headache for the past two days, which I just managed to rid
myself of by lying down for a while. The headache in turn made me quite nauseous; I set
out for the supermarket this afternoon to pick up a few items but actually decided to turn
around and return home as a wave of nausea overtook me. My right side (ie my 'bad'
side, on which I was operated last March to resolve a fistula) is feeling slightly sore,
which always makes me nervous. I have a big welt on my right thigh where I had been
giving myself injections of blood thinner until about two weeks ago. Is it normal that it
hasn't gone down yet? Finally, I don't have much appetite so I'm just going to eat a
baked sweet potato for dinner.
I wouldn't describe any of these symptoms as acute, and as I'd been feeling pretty well
for the past week or so I'll wait and see what happens. I did query Dr. Patel's nurse about
the welt. It's very easy for me to become anxious and dive into worst case scenario land
(recurrence? another fistula?) so I need to try to stay grounded in the present. I think
getting over the retirement decision 'hump, which involved very honest, authentic yet
emotionally-charged conversations with colleagues, staff, students, administrators etc.,
has been rather draining. I'm increasingly at peace with the decision but enacting it is
hard work.
In better news, I did get my first COVID shot. Had to drive about 25 miles to the hospital
in Lewistown, but the setup was excellent, very professional. I told the pharmacist who
inoculated me to be quick to act if I had an allergic reaction, but everything went
smoothly. The staff keeps an eye on everyone who's just been vaccinated for half an
hour afterwards, to make sure no one falls ill. I'll have my second shot on Feb. 26th.
Strangely, I spent most of my weekend obsessively researching my family's genealogy.
I've conducted this type of research for many years in the context of my own work, and
definitely have the skill set to dig deep. It's odd that I've never used these skills to learn
more about my own ancestry (I'm addicted to Henry Louis Gates' show, Finding your
Roots, and fantasize about being his 'ordinary person' guest one day!). I think part of my
motivation derives from wanting to come full circle somehow, to reconnect with my roots
during this 'existential' phase of my life (it's akin to my desire to return to my
hometown). Anyway, I unearthed all sorts of documents (ships' manifests, divorce
records). I learned that my great grandfather William Goldberg (a 'card-carrying
Communist' in Vilna, according to one genealogy site), after whom I'm named, was
actually born....David Cohen (all the names were changed when the various strands of
the family arrived in the States from E. Europe). I also confirmed that at least one of my
great-grandmother's sisters, as well as my great-grandfather's first wife, died in a
concentration camp. So many questions. Writing all this up as a kind of 'memory book'
                       656 / 1.901
seems an attractive retirement project.
Finally, for the second year in a row I hope to participate in the Kelly Gynecologic
Oncology Service's (Johns Hopkins) ""Below the Belt"" Stride and Thrive fundraiser, a 5K
run or 1K walk that will take place on 6 June 2021. The event will again be virtual this
year (instead of taking place in Baltimore), so I hope State College friends will join me
again (we had much fun last year) and that others may consider running/walking
wherever you may find yourself on that date (or come join us in Happy Valley, if the
COVID coast is clear[er]). You can make a donation at any point to my team,

I'm looking ahead to June with hope. This cause means a lot to me. For better or worse,
'cancer survivor' is now a core part of my identity, and if I can pay it forward and help
other women combat this awful disease, I'm all in.

182,"I haven't written in a while. I'm stable right now - not much to report. No news is good
news. I didn't feel terrific this week, though. Discomfort on my right side (my 'bad' side)
and a kind of 'twinge' in my abdomen warranted a blood test, which revealed elevated
liver marker numbers. Three nights of awful insomnia did not help. But my visit with the
nurse practitioner yesterday was reassuring: the liver numbers are, apparently, not
worrisomely high, and a follow-up bilirubin test Dr. Patel ordered yielded normal results.
Moreover, the nurse practitioner felt nothing abnormal on palpating my entire abdominal
area. This was a reassuring report. This morning I slept until 11 a.m. and feel *much*
better. The next 'fingers crossed' moment will occur on W, when my all-important CA 125
level will be assessed via bloodwork. Next Friday I'll receive my second dose of the
                       658 / 1.901
COVID vaccine.
We've been in a deep freeze for several weeks -- lots of snow, sleet, subfreezing temps.
Enormous icicles hang from the exterior of my house. The icicles have icicles! I'm longing
for warmer weather. Hoping to absorb some of that powerful energy I feel when the sun
moves into Pisces, which means that my birthday is around the bend!
I had a strange dream last night, during my deep eleven hour slumber. A notable aspect
of it was that it was 'framed:' I was recounting a story to someone, which then played
out in the dream. I was in a house with other people, but some sort of dangerous 
situation prompted me to flee. I then found myself outside the house, in a snow-covered
landscape at night, trying to escape along with a PSU colleague from Jewish Studies,
Daniel F. [footnote 1]. We were running together through the dark cold snow, headed
towards a forest, when a large wild boar ran across our path and startled me. We made it
into the forest, when I turned and saw a huge black (or brown bear) a few yards from
me. I stayed in place and screamed several times, hoping it would scare the bear away.
That didn't work. I'm not sure what happened next, but Daniel figured out a way to
escape the scary situation by *flying* off on some sort of contraption (like an individual
flying machine). I don't know what happened to me but presumably I escaped too.
The next part of the dream was different. I was also in a house but with a handsome man
whom I didn't recognize. Perhaps he was visiting me. I strongly wanted to be with him,
but my desire was thwarted by a phone call from Gail G., a friend from college [footnote
2]. I hadn't spoken with her in a long time, and felt it would be rude to cut the call short.
She launched into a very detailed account of the union work she was doing (in real life
she is, indeed, a labor advocate and organizer), describing in minute detail the types of
projects she was currently working on for several unions. That's all I remember.
footnote 1: Daniel F., a colleague from Jewish Studies>> a) I am currently teaching my
cross-listed FR/JST course on France and the Holocaust in Film and Literature. Mass
killing, death from disease and starvation, and other horrors are often on the agenda.
The material is very much present with me, obviously seeping into my subconscious life
as well; b)Daniel F. did not attend our JST faculty meeting on Thursday, as he usually
does, but here he was in my dream, fully present; c)Daniel F. recently lost his brother
and parents (to COVID) in quick succession. That's a lot of death to deal with. 
footnote 2: Gail G. >> College friend with whom I'm in touch from time to time and have
seen several times since graduation (in PA and Cali), but still very much connected to my
college years. My dream may well have pointed towards the zoom reunion in which I
participated tonight with some classmates who lived in the same dorm as me in college
(it's our reunion year, but sadly we can't be together in Cambridge so a bunch of virtual
events are planned). 
                       659 / 1.901
It's crazy how intertwined life and death, desire and death, Eros and Thanatos, the
coming spring w/its vitality and promise of rebirth and this long 'winter of my soul' are
for me these days. Both are my companions, in often shifting balance. I think my dream
was trying to tell me that but did not give me clues about how to balance these forces.
At least that's how it feels to me. [note to self: must stay off the Facebook page for
women living with ovarian cancer; it's way too scary].
On a more prosaic note, I am greatly enjoying my teaching this semester! I have some
wonderful students. And I'm very busy with department work and thinking about the
(probably virtual) lecture I need to prepare for May, at the Virginia Museum of Fine Art.
And looking forward to several events being planned around my retirement!",2,fear,0.838836,0.0030804,0.011127984,0.838836,0.029301219,0.04533328,0.057166196,0.015154956
183,"The good news from this month's bloodwork is that my CA125 number -- the ovarian
cancer marker that I await with extreme trepidation each month, steeling myself to open
the message containing it -- is steady at 13.4 U/ml, up from 13 last month. THANK GOD,
as the number indicates that the parp inhibitor I take daily for maintenance is working.
The .4 is insignificant; the number would have needed to have increased by at least 50%
to cause worry. And as a reminder, any number up to 38.1 is within normal range. So I
have a month's 'reprieve' before I need to start worrying again. YES. Every day a
blessing.
The slightly less good news is that my hemoglobin level is low: 8.1 g/dL whereas it
should be a minimum of either 9 or 12 (I was presented with two slightly varying
numbers). This may explain why I have sometimes felt a bit winded recently on minimal
physical exertion: my red blood cells are not receiving ample enough oxygen.
Consequently, I need to stop taking the Zejula (parp inhibitor) for now, and will have my
blood tested again next week. Anemia is apparently quite a common side effect of taking
Zejula, as are higher than usual liver marker numbers (which I have too).
My immediate fear was that those nasty cancer cells would somehow detect that the
Zejula was no longer headed out to beat them up every day up and would say to each
other: ""Come on guys, now's our chance!"" However, both Dr. Beavis and Dr. Patel's
nurse assured me this is not the case. The medication stays in my blood stream for at
least a week. And many studies have shown that stoppage for even longer than that
does not affect treatment. Many Zejula-takers start and stop and start. Ultimately, my
dosage may need to be lowered. But I'm not there yet. So I'll try to up my iron rich foods
this coming week (I'm not a big red meat eater but a big juicy hamburger may be in my
future); oddly enough, I was told to avoid liver, but I'll snag a few bags of fresh spinach
next time I'm at the store).
Dr. Beavis was quite reassuring and wrote: ""Please try not to worry - Dr. Patel is taking
great care of you!""  So I will indeed listen to my oncologist extraordinaire Anna Beavis
and try not to worry. At least for now.
I get my second COVID shot tomorrow!
We've had some lovely sunny days with temps in the 40s and 50s and a slant of light
that hints at spring. After class today I took a long drive in the country to clear my mind,
the farms and still snow-covered fields glistening in the sun and the creeks starting to
                       661 / 1.901
swell. So pretty. 
My birthday is around the corner. Last year it fell right before my fistula-repair operation
(on the 9th) and the onset of the pandemic. I was able to gather friends at a restaurant
we like for drinks and dinner. No such luck this year but I'll think about what might be
arranged.",2,fear,0.6162652,0.016623424,0.0034671596,0.6162652,0.019351047,0.29655933,0.02644039,0.021293445

I had a lovely birthday yesterday, and was literally deluged with social media greetings,
cards, texts, phone calls, zoom calls, flower deliveries, other gifts, and a host of random
acts of kindness. As I wrote on my Facebook page, an advantage (!?) of cancer is that my
bar for happiness is set very low: any day I wake up alive and feeling reasonably well I
am deliriously happy. Yesterday was no exception: every new message or text or card I
read made me smile and I felt very loved! I also received several donations for my
fundraiser for KGOS. Because I also publicly announced my retirement on social media, I
received lovely messages from a number of former students, thanking me and wishing
me well. 
It was a busy day: I had some class prep and grading to take care of in the morning, then
I ran out for about an hour to have my blood checked and to pick up a library book, then
returned for class (which went well). After that, I packed up a cooler and headed to
Spring Creek Park, where I had invited about ten or so friends to gather for a little bday
celebration, w/champagne and cake. Since March was truly ""coming in like a lion""
                       663 / 1.901
yesterday, it was windy and cold with an occasional ray of sun piercing the clouds, and
we did our best to hold down the napkins, paper plates and cups flying everywhere. We
stayed no more than an hour but a convivial time was had by all and it was so nice to
see my friends 'in the flesh' instead of as simulacra on a computer screen. And the
gurgling creek and picturesque covered bridge always cheer me.
Although I received an automated message that the results of my bloodwork had come
in yesterday - as well as, truth be told.... -- a phone message from Dr. Patel's office
asking me to call to discuss the results -- I had decided that I would put off any unwanted
news until this morning. As expected (suspected?), yesterday's bloodwork showed very
low hemoglobin levels (even lower than last time), so I'll need to have a blood
transfusion on Monday. I stopped by Dr. Patel's office this afternoon to get further details
from his head nurse, Kayla, who gave me a sheaf of orders to take to the lab at the
hospital lab tomorrow so that they can run further tests on my blood (folic acid, B12,
iron, bilirubin etc.). Monday I need to be at the hospital at 7:00 (I am *not* an early riser)
and the transfusion will take the better part of the day, but the good news is that I'll
likely feel much better (ie less winded and fatigued) afterwards. I'll bring my work with
me and see what I can manage. I'm definitely bummed that in the meantime I can't take
my chemo med -- which is the likely culprit as far as the decrease in hemoglobin goes --
for one more week, two weeks, who knows. And when/if I resume it, it may be at a lower
dose. And that means that much less Zejua in my system to combat my cancer. But the
blood issue needs to be resolved now, before it impacts my bone marrow -- which would
not be good. So back to one day at a time. Ugh.
Dr. Patel was very busy, very harried, as he is sometimes, and was a bit brusque with
me, which I can handle. He was fairly insistent on 'we have to do this first before we can
determine next steps,' so he didn't have much patience for questions I had about 'what
ifs.' He assured me that I should be fine this weekend and that I will feel much more
energetic after the transfusion, which I don't doubt. He has so many patients. I really
wish that Geisinger could hire another oncologist or two.
I'll try to rest and relax as much as I can this weekend but I do have some work to take
care of, with two big reports due this month. Last time I had a blood transfusion I did feel
much better from it, so I hope that will be the case again. I'm of course nervous about
being in the hospital w/so many COVID patients there: I'm about a week out from my
second COVID shot so the antibodies are still kicking in. And there are always risks
w/transfusions, but I know the blood will be scrupulously screened beforehand -- and I'm
thankful to whomever donated it.
I did take a long drive today to clear my head. The sight of cows, horses, barns and fields
in this last stretch of winter helped me relax.
I hope to individually contact everyone who sent birthday greetings. I so appreciate the
                       664 / 1.901
well wishes. It just must take me a little while. XO

185,"My transfusion appeared to go well today. It did not take as long as expected, as I was
done by about 12:40. My wonderful friend Maria was kind enough to drive me to the
cancer pavilion at the hospital for 7 a.m. while my equally wonderful friend Helen picked
me up afterwards and drove me to pick up a cappuccino. This gave us time, coming and
going, to dish about the Harry-Meghan-Oprah interview and catch up on this and that.
Maybe I've been spoiled by Hopkins (and even Geisinger here), but the care at the
hospital seemed subpar to me. They had no records regarding my prior transfusion at
the hospital, my medications, previous surgeries etc. At one point, the nurse didn't seem
to know whether I had received one bag of blood already or two. Worst, while adjusting
my chair, the nurse *twice* yanked on the syringe connected via a needle to my port,
through which I was receiving the blood. The second time, she yanked so hard that the
needle came flying out of my port (which is inserted underneath the skin on my upper
chest) along with the entire dressing covering it. It hurt like a mofo and I just had to
scream *F***!* at the top of my lungs. The needle had to be reinserted, the syringe
cleaned out etc. Nor terribly reassuring, when I was really looking forward to having the
nurses take care of me. Oh well. The bottom line is that I was pumped up with two bags
of fresh, healthy blood that will hopefully energize me and ensure that my body's getting
sufficient oxygen. I think I feel a bit better now but I'm not entirely sure: I'm tired
because I didn't sleep well, or much, last night. We'll see what tomorrow brings. The
nurse said it might take a day or two for me to feel better. She noted that my color was
improved when I left the hospital; apparently, I looked somewhat ashen on arrival.
I'll have my blood tested on Thursday and Dr. Patel will assess the hemoglobin levels. I
don't know when I'll be able to start taking the Zejula again. Dr. Beavis reassured me by
letting me know that studies have shown that it can be just as effective if taken at a
lower dose, which is what may be in store for me.
I dozed on the couch for a while and did some work after that. The weather is turning
more spring-like and I want to be able to take walks and maybe some short hikes. The
health issues are very frustrating but I need to take one day at a time.

186,"It's been a very chaotic week-ten days and I feel wiped out. I think I did not report here
that last week (or perhaps ten days ago), a few days after my transfusion, I walked into
my kitchen in the morning and noticed that a medium sized patch on the ceiling above
the fridge was wet and 'bulging;' it looked like a water-filled 'sac' of paint had dropped
down and was about to burst. I called the managing agent for my condo complex
immediately and two of their guys came over; they reported that my water heater was
busted and leaking into the kitchen ceiling (as I do not have a basement, my water
heater is in a utility closet on the second floor). They recommended two plumbing
companies, which I called immediately; as the first was tied up for several days, I made
arrangements for the second to come assess the damage and hopefully do the repairs.
In the meantime, I also called the construction company that I had used the previous
time this happened (leak from upstairs bathroom...) and my insurance company. I am
thankful that the benefits of my transfusion were starting to kick in and I had the
wherewithal, for the most part, to handle the aggravation.
Long story short: I had to endure five days of of cohabiting with three ginormous
dehumidifers that made it feel and sound like a blast furnace in my home; am out $3K to
pay for a new hot water heater (insurance won't cover it but it does enhance the value of
my home a bit); and had to deal with plumbers who were both incompetent and total
*gonifs:* their work was so awful that they had to come back the next day and redo it
entirely; the hot water in my kitchen sink is no more than a trickle, so I'll need to have
them return next week. And the owner of said plumbing company (Allied Mechanical and
Electrical: State College friends, do *not* use them!) promised me pie in the sky (free
inspections for several years; a stern talking to the plumbers who messed up; no extra
payment; and all of this in writing -- which I've yet to receive). So I will definitely be on
the phone Monday morning w/stern words and demands.
Oy.
Maybe this is the universe telling me to move to NY (or stay here) and become a renter.
I have a lot of work as we get towards the end of the semester, not just for my class but
for the department (evaluations of colleagues, all sorts of reports, budget stuff,
proposals to be submitted before I retire etc.). I'm running a bit late on some tasks partly
b/c of the chaos of the past ten days. And taxes!
Oy.
                       670 / 1.901
A friend with whom I took a walk on Sunday with a group of other lovely women (we
meet once a month) tested positive for COVID, along with several family members. I feel
terribly for her. This prompted me though to hastily schedule a COVID test for this
morning. Even though I'm fully vaccinated, even though we were walking outside and my
friend was fully masked (I took my mask off a few times to inhale some extra oxygen), I
want to be extra careful for *Ben's* sake, as he's coming home tomorrow to spend a
week here. I'll get the results in 2-7 days. Further, I queried both my PCP and my
oncologist here; both consider me 'low risk' to either contract or transmit COVID. The
CDC guidelines confirm this: vaccinated people (vaccinatees?) apparently can be around
people with COVID if they follow precautions (masking etc.). The CDC would only advise
testing if I became symptomatic.
But it's all in the scheme of things. There is better news:
Did I mention that Ben is coming home tomorrow for a week??! Which means, among
other things, that we may be able to have a little seder together, like we did last year,
for Passover. He'll be very busy with schoolwork, as will I, but it will be terrific to have
him here!
Of course as all this chaos is occurring I am also running weekly to the lab for bloodwork,
sending messages to Dr. Patel's nurse via the Geisinger portal, debriefing about my
bloodwork with the pharmacist who works with Dr. Patel and who calls me every time
new results come in (she's specializes in cancer meds such as Zejula), setting up
delivery times for my Zejula ETC. ETC. A job in itself.
So Annie (the pharmacist) called shortly before I both went to get my COVID test and
greeted the contractor assessing the kitchen ceiling damage. Thank God my numbers
are still stable overall, despite being slightly low or high here or there. My hemoglobin
level is inching back up to normal range (it had cratered as a result of my taking 200 mg
of Zejula [which caused me to be very winded], now cut in half to 100 mg daily). My
kidney function number was a bit off but we both feel certain that it was because I was
dehydrated; I distinctly remember leaving my drink in the car by accident as I walked
into the lab and thinking to myself: ""I'm thirsty, and I know it's going to affect my
numbers."" Next labs in two weeks.
Finally, my all-important CA125 number is considered stable. It's risen from 13.4 last
month to 17.1 this month; an increase of 3.7. Of course I worry about that slight upward
trend two months in a row, but Annie reminded me that anything up to 38 is normal, and
I'm still more than 50% under that. The drs. start to worry with very notable increases
(such as doubling), whereas a slight variation like this can be due to any number of
factors (stress, dehydration etc.). So I will simply decide not to worry about this for a
month, until my next test. Thankfully, all my numbers have been generally stable for the
past 5-6 months. I'll take it. Every day a blessing!

It's been quite a while since I've written. Everything's accelerating as we hurtle towards
the end of the semester, with four weeks to go. That means it's the season for reports --
pre-tenure review reports, senior faculty review reports, annual faculty evaluation
reports (following hour-long meetings w/most of my colleagues), graduate student
evaluation reports, an external tenure and promotion review to complete, lots of grading,
and a whole bunch of other work -- plus my paper to revise for a virtual lecture to the
Council of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts next month. I'm trying to be fairly single-
minded in my approach to checking items off my list -- for the last time. Eight more class
sessions left and then it's over and out. This class has been a joy and I'll be sad to leave
the students. Work will likely extend through May -- preparing next year's budget,
finishing up some admin work -- and cleaning out my office!
I'm feeling pretty well overall. My blood counts have been relatively stable (a little high
here, a little low there), my energy is pretty good (a mile walk is no problem, for
example), stamina good, appetite robust (I've gained about five pounds of the twenty
I've lost over the past two years, but no worries), sleep better since the dose of my parp
inhibitor was lowered. I will see Dr. Patel this week for a check in, then have my CA 125
level tested in about two weeks. The sword of Damocles is always hanging over me,
though. Try as I might to 'be in the moment' (and I've gotten pretty good at that), there's
always that niggling fear: ""Is cancer trying to make quick work of me?"" ""I'm only as
healthy as my last blood test/scan"" ""Ok, I guess I know how I'll be spending my summer
now...."" Because of course my cancer could recur at any time, as advanced ovarian
cancer does. The ""honeymoon periods"" might be considered feints, a tease, un leurre, a
bait and switch. And that sucks. But each day at a time, yes, yes...
Easter is of course the day I drove myself to the ER in a panic two years ago because I
knew something was wrong; I had never had constipation that severe, compounded by
that slight yet persistent bloating.. Thankfully, the ER was my default option when I
learned there would be a several hour wait at MedExpress, where I'm convinced they
would have simply sent me home with some Mirolax. I knew something was up when the
radiology technician looked at me quizzically and said ""How long have you been feeling
this way?"" followed by ""Good luck"" -- rather ominously, I thought -- when I left. The
imaging was a mess, of course: lesions in my colon, likely presence of a malignancy,
abnormalities in several spots (I've actually blocked out their names -- oh yes, the
omentum --  but eventually Dr. Beavis either removed those areas or as many cancerous
bits as she could from them). That was Easter 2019; so much for redemption.
But I've only given that a passing thought because Ben is 26 today and that is wonderful.
So glad that my body was able to help create, house, nourish and give birth to him well
before it came under attack. He's doing so well, and I loved hearing about his foodie
adventures in the city -- a day of sampling dumplings and noodles in Flushing yesterday;
                       675 / 1.901
Israeli brunch in Park Slope this morning. He was also home for a week recently and we
were able to enjoy a simple seder together. I had the stamina to make chicken matzah
ball soup, sweet and sour brisket, matzah stuffing, tzimmes, and lemon macaroons.
Somehow I also managed to pull off a Passover meal last year, right after I had my fistula
operation. Don't quite know how I did it (this year I felt much more peppy), but I do know
I have a strong life force. One of my retirement projects is to compile all the family
holiday recipes (some barely legible through the food stains) and pass them on to Ben.
I've taken to exploring backroads around here; it's so very pretty and peaceful in the
spring. The trees are about to bloom (I counted three nests in them on my walk today)
and it reminds me of when Ben was born: spring was coming into life and 'blooming,' and
so was my baby boy (we were jolted into a harsher reality a few weeks later when I sat
down to nurse him one morning, turned on the t.v., and witnessed the horrifying
aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing). In any event, there's a scenic road along
Penn's Creek that delights me; yesterday, people were fly fishing in the creek (some of
you may know about my strange obsession w/fly fishing and my long-held desire to take
it up) and the Amish buggies were rolling down the twisting and turning road (just ignore
all the Trump signs.....; the flip side of 'quaint' and 'rural'). Stopped at an Amish farm to
pick up local eggs, honey, horseradish and a bunch of pussy willows; drove to another to
buy their maple syrup.
I'm all vaccinated and yearning for a change of scene. Hope to get to the city next
month. Longing to plunk down in a beach chair by the ocean or even a pool w/a good
novel. Anyone want to join me? I would even consider going myself - the Jersey,
Maryland and Delaware beaches are within striking distance.
P.S. Also participated in a virtual reunion w/my freshman dorm mates, which was
fabulous! So very happy to reconnect with several people I used to like -- as 18-year-
olds, anyway. :)

188,"I met w/Dr. Patel a few days ago for my three month check-in/check-up. He spent about
30 mn w/me so I did not feel rushed. Bottom line: as of today, I am stable; ""you're doing
good,"" he told me in his lilting Indian accent. When I ask him for predictions or detailed
                       681 / 1.901
prognoses -- I should know better at this point not to do so -- he won't go there with me.
It's enough for me to hear his reply when I ask him if there's any reasonable chance that
my cancer *won't* recur: ""That's not the likely scenario."" I know this too, of course; it's
not pleasant to hear, but it's a needed reality check. Dr. Patel's m.o. is all about keeping
me grounded in the present: ""Don't worry about what you can't control;"" ""Enjoy the good
days"" [implication: there will most likely be bad ones to come]; ""Go spend time with your
son"" (Dr. P will even give me a 'pass' if I want to skip blood work for a few weeks). So I
recalibrate and refocus on what I can control: take the Zejula (oral chemo med) daily, try
to eat healthily (but have gained back nearly *ten* of the twenty pounds I had lost since
my first surgery; blame my now quite hearty appetite, I suppose...); try to sleep well
(doing a bit better on that front recently); hydrate, hydrate, hydrate (it's crucial that my
kidneys function well, just as it's essential that my bone marrow remain robust );  stay as
emotionally and psychologically buoyant as possible. Recenter myself in the present;
cultivate gratitude; carpe diem. I'm actually doing pretty well on all these fronts, but the
annoying thing is not being able to make plans (eg for travel, now that us vaccinated folk
are starting to circulate again), as I could have a recurrence *at any time.* The key may
lie in spontaneity: look into last minute travel deals; hop in my car and head to a cute
beachfront bnb for the weekend; set my sights on New York as soon as the end of
semester frenzy eases.
Blood work coming up on Friday, including testing CA125 level. Praying for another
month-long reprieve if those results look good. Nervous about the slight upward trend
(11>13>17) of the CA125 but hoping that creep is not significant (if it inches into the
20s or certainly the 30s it's time to see what's going on, which likely will mean a scan).
But I'm getting ahead of myself again. Stay in the moment. Refocus. Breathe. Rinse and
repeat.
I'm powering through the last weeks of the semester with a lot of juice; worked hard all
day today except for a break to take a leisurely stroll w/two women friends. Time now for
dinner and pre-bedtime decompression (=junk t.v.). Forgive my somewhat telegraphic
delivery here. More soon.

It's been quite a while since I've written. I'll blame it on a frantically hectic end of
semester. Health update first: thankfully, I've been enjoying a good stretch (five
months?) of feeling pretty darn well. The liver numbers seemed somewhat disquieting to
me, but Dr. Patel and two of his nurses feel that, although higher than they should be,
the liver counts are not a major cause for concern at this point. I'll have my blood tested
on Thursday, including for my CA125 number. I feel well, but know that those aggressive
cancer cells (not sure if that's the 'carcinoma' or 'sarcoma' part of my diagnosis) could
rebel at any time. ""Is it possible that my cancer won't recur?"" I asked Dr. Patel, meekly.
""That's not the likely scenario [once you've already had one recurrence, as you have],""
says he (which of course, I tell myself, entering the realm of magical thinking, doesn't
mean that no further recurrences is *an impossibility...*)  . So I continue to lead two
lives: my everyday life, in which I go about my business, grade the papers, grocery shop,
make plans to meet friends for coffee, and - at least recently, as I found myself saying
out loud to myself one day -- feel ""almost normal"" (how exotic) and my ""shadow life,"" the
one in which I'm consumed by thoughts of my mortality (I'm now super intrigued by the
idea of a ""living funeral,"" although apparently I'm nowhere near that point yet), fixated
on counts and numbers, hyper-focused on my body, shaken when a survivor/subscriber
to an OC chat room I belong to ""gains her wings"" (in online parlance). Must stay in the
moment. Must.stay.in.the.moment. MUST STAY IN THE MOMENT.
But for now, it's (almost) summertime, and the livin' is eas (-ier). I am in the city for the
first time since Dec. 2019 and it feels great! First, my apologies to any NY friends and
family whom I won't get to see on this initial, relatively quick trip back, during which I am
choosing to spend time with immediate family (it’s been well over a year) and a few
close friends. If my health remains stable, I definitely plan to make a return trip over the
summer and will arrange to see other dear ones who I couldn’t meet this time.
The hugs are terrific. All over the city, people are hugging. Long, tight embraces after
months, if not years of separation, hugs full of love, joy and relief, as if to say: “It’s been
an unreasonably long wait, getting through the pandemic was hell, but we made it, and
this time I’m not letting you go!” But there seems to be ‘first hug’ etiquette. I leaned in,
instinctively, towards my college pal Bryan, whom I hadn’t seen in a year and a half,
before he stopped me to make sure that my immune system could handle a hug,
offering an elbow bump instead. When I assured him I was both fully vaxxed and feeling
well, we fell into the tightest, longest squeeze! Ditto with my grad school besties, whom I
last hung out with on a pre-pandemic yoga retreat in the Berkshires at the end of the
year before last. A beautiful reunion.
The gorgeous spring weather is bringing New Yorkers out. Diners pack ‘huts’ taking up
several parking spaces outside restaurants, and spill into the street. The Union Square
farmers market bustles. The number of bikes seems to equal that of cars. Most everyone
                       689 / 1.901
is masked (certainly indoors) but some remove their masks outdoors. Lots of empty
store fronts, though. And homeless. I can’t imagine how desolate midtown is. The city is
rebounding but it will take time and effort. I’m a city walker. The rhythms and vibes of
my city resonate with me. I may need to move back sooner rather than later.
A wonderful cousin w/whom I’ve recently reconnected has lent me the fabulous floor-
through loft apartment she and her husband own in Flatiron. Staying in this stylish place,
full of interesting books, artwork, and objects presumably collected from my cousins’
travels, is good for me.
So there’s been a happy family reunion lunch at a Spanish tapas restaurant, followed by
a swing by Eataly and a family hang in Madison Square Park (abuzz with sunbathers!); an
equally joyous reunion w/my grad school friends over brunch off Washington Square
Park, amidst our NYU haunts; pizza w/my mother and Arnold; tomorrow, a picnic in
Central Park w/a few college friends and dinner w/my mother and Ben’s girlfriend,
Sammi; Wednesday, lunch and gab fest w/my cousin Julie, who lives in FL but who
fortuitously this week is helping my aunt move back into her CT home; and then
Thursday, back to SC w/Ben (who’s actually been hiking w/buddies in CO this week, but
w/whom I had a quick lunch at Breads Bakery before he left for the airport). We’ll catch
up in the car. There’s also been some shopping (Kiehl’s, Sephora, and I’ll likely hit
Kalustyan tomorrow to pick up dried fruits and nuts, hummus, baba ganoush, and
Turkish delight for a small gathering I’m hosting on Friday; also need harissa paste).
There’s also been some admin work that I need to finish up before my headship term
ends and I’m officially retired on 30 June. There’s also been hanging out at my mom’s
apartment, going through her heirloom jewelry, clothes, and old photos, remembering
the stories attached to them, as we like to do. My considerable energy and stamina have
surprised me; the city and time w/friends and family appear to energize me. MUST STAY
IN THESE MOMENTS. Every day a blessing.
My last class of the semester was perfect. It flowed. It was a celebration of how much the
students had learned (in my course on France and the Holocaust in Film and Literature)
and the good uses to which I sense they will put their knowledge. Perhaps their satisfied
faces in their Zoom boxes tell the story.
More good stuff coming. So good, in fact, that I will choose not to look at my bloodwork
results until this coming weekend, after the next round of good stuff is over. Need to
resist, for just a little while longer at least, worried projections into the future.
Finally, as I've mentioned I believe, on 6/6 I'll be participating for the second year in a
row in a 1k walk/5k run to raise funds for the Kelly Gynecologic Oncology at Hopkins,
where I have received cutting-edge treatment and life-sustaining care from Dr. Anna
Beavis and indeed every medical professional I've encountered there. Should you wish to

192,"My health continues to remain stable, which is by far the most important thing right now.
My counts are normal. My CA 125 number (OC marker)is at 18, still well within the
normal range (0-38), although it's a point higher than it was last month, and a few
months ago it was at 11. So is this a normal fluctuation or a very subtle and slow uptick?
That uncertainty translated into a bunch of sleepless hours one night. In the words of the
nurse who calls me after each blood test to debrief: ""Right now we do not consider this a
cause for concern."" So I'll hold onto that until otherwise advised. Overall, I'm still feeling
well, remain energetic, and continue to pray that this prolonged (for me) 'honeymoon
phase' continues.

The excellent health report fortunately put into perspective a tech disaster that occurred
the morning of my retirement party last Friday, when I realized that I had returned home
to not one but two non-functioning computers: my laptop (which had worked fine in NY)
was dead (battery, according to my IT people here at Penn State, is 'swollen' and needs
to be replaced, but my files are fine) and my desktop also seemed dead as a doornail
(message reads: ""fan failure;"" I surmise it may have overheated when I was in the city. IT
folks will be working on that tomorrow too). Problem was that I had not saved my
prepared remarks for the party on a thumb drive and Ben (who came back to SC with
me) spent hours patiently waiting for my laptop to acquire enough 'juice' for him to be
able to send that document to his own computer. All was resolved with about twenty
minutes to spare before the party started at 2 p.m.; I didn't even have time to shower. In
the end, I used Ben's laptop to participate in the party and read my remarks off his iPad
(he then switched to his phone to watch). I honestly don't know what I would have done
had Ben not been there to save the day. 
It's hard for me to describe how wonderful the party was ; instead, I will include the link
to it below. Well over 100 people attended, representing all phases and walks of my life:
family, colleagues, current and former students (some from the late 1990s), friends from
grade school, college, grad school, friends and colleagues from the States and France.
Quite amazing. There were dozens of touching tributes via video and written text, many
transmitted during a 35 mn video/slide presentation that my colleagues and one of my
graduate students had skillfully and artfully put together (part of it was paired with a
colleague in tux and bow tie singing an impressive rendition of ""My Way"").  Colleagues
and grad students contributed to  a bounty of gifts for me that showed they know my
taste/s *perfectly:* a gorgeous scarf from the MET patterned with a Delacroix bouquet,
an equally gorgeous, vaguely Deco-ish necklace featuring triangular pieces of pink opal,
a beautiful blown glass flower, perhaps an iris, which pairs beautifully with a green Deco
vase on my mantle and from the students: a fabulous charcuterie board that has me
planning future parties; Yotam Ottolenghi's _Jerusalem_ cookbook (he's my current
cooking god/guru)  and a gorgeous leather bound and monogrammed blank recipe book
for me to fill with our family recipes and give to Ben (I must have mentioned that I
intended to make that a retirement project). Inserted in the book were several favorite
recipes from the *students.* I was so touched by the care and thoughtfulness these
presents represent. I could share many other impressions but I think the recording tells
the story best. Feel free to watch or dip in (but be forewarned that it lasts two hours!):

I had a modest afterparty for a few colleagues  at my home following the virtual event:
champagne, cake, and goodies I had brought back from Kalustyan in the city (humus and
                       694 / 1.901
baba ganoush, cumin spiced cashews, tapenade, samosas, olives etc.). This was the first
'unmasked' and in person many of us had experienced in a long time and we were all
giddy with excitement!
I kept thinking about this gospel song that (for some reason) my father used to like:
""We're blessed,"" by the Mighty Clouds of Joy: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzkNtZmv-rl  YES!
My stay in the city was terrific. A college classmate organized a potluck picnic (goodies
from Zabar's!) for about fifteen or so of us, in an idyllic spot in Central Park overlooking
the rowboat lake on a glorious day. I entered the park at Strawberry Fields and a guy
was playing one of my favorite Lennon songs: ""Jealous Guy."" Happy to see some friends
among this group and to meet others whom I didn't know well in college. One classmate
even got us to do a silly line dance that he and another friend edited into a fun/ny video
that was shown at another 40th reunion event  in CA:

Password: 81SoMuchFun!
My last day in NY my cousin Julie came to the city from CT, where she was helping her
mother (ie my aunt) move back into her home after spending the winter in FL. Julie lives
in FL too so the timing was quite fortuitous.  It was wonderful to catch up over brunch, a
stroll around the farmer's market and a chat in Union Square Park w/my same-age
cousin, who as she put it in the college she made for me (included in the video portion of
my retirement fete), is my 'friend by choice' and sister by temperament, shared
experience, closeness etc. (my paraphrase). It was wonderful. I dropped Julie off at my
mother's in the late afternoon so they could spend some quality aunt-niece time.
So Ben and I drove back from the city to SC, me feeling high on New York, as if I needed
to return immediately. Of course, as soon as I returned home I started to feel high on
State College again. Saturday I took off in my car into the country, as I like to do; the
farmland is starting to look lush, the streams and creeks are gurgling happily, birds are
singing. I stopped by my new favorite antiques store and bought an Art Nouveau mirror,
then headed to an Amish farm to pick up rhubarb and asparagus. It's so peaceful here,
so quiet, my condo is so comfortable and I'm surrounded by all the pretty things I've
assembled.
Not much planned for this holiday weekend: Saturday will visit a friend's art exhibit in
Bellefonte (county seat, pretty Victorian architecture) w/a few other friends + have
lunch. May go to an Amish market tomorrow where I had good luck buying nice planters
next year. But it will be quiet.  And that's when I start jonesing for the city again. In the
end, despite the rich trove of friendships and love engulfing me at my retirement party, I
                       695 / 1.901
feel that I don't have that many close friends here, at least friends that I can contact on a
weekend and say: ""hey, wanna take a drive for a few hours and hit an antiques store, a
greenhouse and a farmstand or two?"" My NY 'life' (and my Paris life) seem more
amenable to that type of spontaneous outing.
So I'm back to a sort of existential state: I have a whole free day ahead of me (but rest
assured, I do have a good amount of work still to tie up before my official retirement
date of 6/30); how do I want to spend it? I've also been spinning travel fantasies:
watched a great cooking/food show called ""High on the Hog"" last night (on the roots of
African-American cooking); the first episode was set in Benin, which suddenly  gave me a
wild desire to go to Benin -- those gorgeous patterned fabrics! the food looks really good!
They speak French! Those fabulous floating markets! And the dolorous history that I
need to know more about. Then I was concocting a trip to the West Coast to visit
everyone I know there -- rent a car and explore the coastline. Then I was planning an
asap trip to Paris. And a return visit to NY. But June is so pretty here in central PA: why
not stay here, throw out all the files I no longer need, relax, read, cook, hike, enjoy...
First-world problems, for sure (yet always compounded for me by that irksome sense of
""time's wing'd chariot hurrying near"").
So I feel like I'm in a bit of free fall right now. I knew it would happen as retirement
nears. It brings to mind a passage from Georges Perec's _W, or the Memory of
Childhood_ that my students and I read this semester in my course on France and the
Holocaust: ""I was plunged into nothingness; all the threads were broken; I fell, on my
own, without any support."" I've also been loving John Mayer's acoustic cover of Tom
Petty's ""Free Falling:""
I'm gonna free fall out into nothin'
Gonna leave this world for a while
And I'm free 
Free fallin' 
The song's not about my current state, but yet it resonates. I'll leave you with it:

strongly about it. It's part of me now, part of my identity. And ovarian cancer is a horrible
disease. The funds raised will help provide an array of services to survivors both in the
hospital and beyond, which have greatly benefitted my own recovery and have made me

It's been a wondrous weekend, marked by the convergence of Stride&Thrive, the
fundraiser for Hopkins' KGOS (Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service), for which I've been
rallying the troops the better part of the past year, and the two events (virtual this year)
that form the emotional core of each of our college reunions: ""Glimpses"" and the
Memorial Service.
Stride&Thrive took place this morning, bookended by the reunion events. Bright
sunshine and heat; I needed to make sure to take two full water bottles before driving to
meet my #willapower teammates at the Pump Station Cafe in Boalsburg, across the
street from the Military Museum path along which we also walked last year. I've spent
much of the past few days trying to raise my fundraising total: I had set a perhaps
unrealistic goal of $10K but was thrilled, thanks to a flurry of last minute donations, to
report a total of $8.168.00 from *108 donors,* up from about $7K last year (my total was
fourth highest out of about twenty-five participating teams). And each $ will help fund
Hopkins' remarkable survivorship services: mentorship programs (which paired me with
a wonderful mentor two years ago), services for caregivers, discussion groups,
programming, gift bags for survivors (that crocheted afghan came in handy during
chemo...), an excellent web page, virtual yoga classes, classes on journaling etc. It's
possible that some of the funds go to basic research too -- also very important -- but in
my experience the 'aftercare' of survivors (ie those surviving with gyn. cancers) is crucial
as well. I had to ask Ben at some point in the last day or two if I seemed like I was
'groveling' for $, even pestering a few of my neighbors who have helped me over the
past few years and outright asking a few college classmates to please contribute. As I've
said elsewhere on this blog, however, I will beg, borrow and steal, and grovel if need be,
to be a crusader against cancer. 
My team totaled twenty-two altogether: proudly wearing our #willapower t-shirts, nine of
us, all women, walked/ran in State College, with seven of us walking a mile at the
Military Museum, one walking (her dog) separately, and a ninth running a 5k early this
morning. Others (all wonderful former grad students, now friends) ran in a)Philly;
b)Winston-Salem, NC; c)the Sonoran Desert in AZ and d)E. Lansing, Michigan. A college
friend ran in Baltimore. Sammi, visiting her sister, ran/hiked in LA. The picture Ben texted
me of him and his *grade school buddies* - Joe, Nikhil, and Kyle (+ Nikhil's gf), now all
living in NY -- before (or after?) their 5K in Prospect Park and all wearing their
#willapower shirts, made me beam. I flashed back to the time when, 5-10 years ago (?), I
explained to Ben the importance of his playing in a golf tournament to raise funds for
(ironically) another ovarian cancer charity, from which the mother of one of his friends
was suffering (she eventually succumbed). So Ben is all in now, and that makes me one
proud momma. Thank you, Ben, for the mitzvah you and your friends performed today.
You're good men (and Irene is a good woman!). And thanks to my awesome State
College teammates, fellow 'Amazons'/warrior goddesses Maria, Mary, Jackie, Jean, Tracy,
                       700 / 1.901
Helen, Bettina and Carol. And to the rest of my far-flung crew. I wish you could have
joined our State College team for our post-walk coffee, a lovely moment of friendship,
caring, laughter, and sisterhood.
p.s. We did not win the 'spirit award' as we did last year (I personally thought we had
TONS of spirit!), but no matter. 
As mentioned, Stride&Thrive took place the morning after ""Glimpses,"" a reunion tradition
(which may or may not be specific to my class) during which classmates who volunteer
ahead of time briefly (5 mn.) share something important about their lives -- a challenge,
accomplishment, pleasurable activity, experience etc. It's all very 'unplugged' and raw
(and in that sense, very 'un-Harvard;' my jaw dropped during the very first 'Glimpse' I
heard, several reunions ago, which began: ""Hi, I'm [name of classmate], and I'm an
alcoholic""). At our last reunion I shared a ""glimpse,"" in the form of a letter to my hot
mess of a college self from my older self, weaving in the trove of letters I wrote home
during that time, and which my parents saved. In any event, virtual 'glimpses' (with
about 160 attending) may not have the same visceral punch as they do when we're
sitting side by side in the Science Center auditorium, but many of these vignettes were
still affecting. I could have done without the one about why this particular classmates
loves loons (apparently the bird watchers loved it), but was moved by a classmate's
heartfelt account of the challenges of navigating a gender transition with her child, which
ended ""I'm so proud to be his mom."" Others spoke about the nature of home, the awful
experience of being a [Black] lawyer and poll watcher during the 2016 election, teaching
prison writing, the passion for kimonos as related to culture and identity on the part of a
American classmate who's lived in Japan for many years. Fascinating, real, gripping. One
classmate, the attorney for the city of Ann Arbor, MI, wove together three stories, one
involving going to the store to buy face cream for his wife, also a classmate, ill with
metastatic breast cancer. When I sent my well wishes to her in the chat and mentioned
that I was facing a cancer battle too, at least three classmates reached out to me via the
chat (and two later emailed me), offering their support and empathy. I was so touched. I
must say, since graduation and especially over the past fifteen years or so, this
classmate network has not ceased to surprise me in the best ways. We've all been
tested. We’ve all grieved, lost parents or siblings, faced death and divorce, experienced
serious illness or have given care to someone who has. Just about every classmate I’ve
met or re-met in the past 15-20 years – and I’ve actually made some new friends among
classmates I didn’t know in college – is totally over any pretense cultivated during
college, when we were young and trying to figure out who we were and what we wanted
from life. But whho are we kidding now? It’s time to get real. So the empathy extended
toward me (and which I tried to let flow towards others) was welcome indeed.
The “Glimpse” that moved me the most, I believe, was somewhat obscure, based on the
imagery of broken pottery (the classmate has recently taken up ceramics) as a metaphor
for his painful estrangement from his daughter. Life and death were woven through his
                       701 / 1.901
story too: “Death is present in the midst of life.” Although told in the form of an allegory,
his story affected me greatly and I could sense his pain.
After Stride&Thrive, I crashed on the couch for a while, then zoomed into the memorial
service for classmates who have died since graduation. The list, of course, gets longer
every reunion. Five years ago we were in Memorial Church on the Harvard campus for
the service and I remarked to a classmate: “One day, none of us will be here.” Today I
sat there watching on my computer screen, and wondered: “In five years, will I be here?”
Statistically, I know that the odds are about 50/50, maybe better than 50% b/c I receive
stellar care at Hopkins. So I felt myself sinking down in my chair, dabbing at my eyes
while weighed down by that thought and by certain memories of Harvard friends and
lovers who have passed on. But other forces kept me in equipoise: the previous day’s
sense of bonding with other survivor classmates, the beautiful poetry, singing, and
dirges played on a violin that several classmates contributed, the insights brought by
two classmates who are spiritual leaders (one a rabbi, one an ecumenical minister
[United Religions Initiative]). Their words were calming, healing, bringing a metaphysical
perspective to my worries and really tying together all the strands of this great weekend.
“Time and space are not the measure of all things.” “…life that knows no death.” “..love
everlasting.” “the wondrous quality of each breath we take.”
What will my legacy be? And yours?
Or to quote Mary Oliver (as a classmate did):
“Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?”

195,"An entire month has elapsed since my last blood test (and I wrote my last CB entry about
that time as well). Since then, I've officially retired from Penn State, hosted my mother
for a fun week-long visit, drove to NY w/her and spent a few days there, which included
dinner w/Ben and Sammi at a yummy Israeli restaurant in Park Slope (Muriam) preceded
by cocktails (a mocktail for me) with my grad school friend Shanny at a cool cocktail bar
called Blueprint (also in Park Slope); lunch with another close grad school friend, Harriet;
and some essential spice/condiment shopping at Kalustyan (several varieties of salt,
peppercorns, za'atar, a few ""I can't resist"" pieces of halvah and Turkish delight).
Today's blood counts aren't revealing much. The hemoglobin and liver count numbers
are high, but that's par for the course, and they are not substantially higher than they've
been (a few have even come down a bit). But obviously too much stress on my liver and
red blood cells is not good. The CA125 number will be the big test (I'll see Dr. Patel
tomorrow morning), and I've been feeling very anxious for the past few days for several
reasons: a)I've had some discomfort on my right side for a few weeks. No sharp pain, but
discomfort at bottom of rib cage (liver??), compounded with mild nausea (I do stress
mild) and maybe (??) some lower back discomfort (something? nothing? result of two
five-hour drives to/from NY + two nights bad sleep? stress? cancer in my back and/or
kidneys?). On the 'plus' side, I should mention that my appetite is normal, ditto for my
energy level, and I don't look visibly 'ill' but I've come to understand that serious illness
is not always signaled visually; b) I intuit that I may be 'due' for a recurrence, as Dr.
Beavis told me they usually occur at regular intervals (my first occurred after six months
and it's been about another six months since I finished chemo to deal with that first
recurrence; on the other hand, there were 'complicating factors' during the period of the
first recurrence due to my fistula surgery, drainage procedures etc.). Hopefully I'll know
more tomorrow. Admittedly, I'm having trouble staying calm, imagining the worst
('defensive pessimism,' my therapist calls it).
What lifted me up today was a *wonderful* zoom convo with Brenda, a college classmate
whom I did not know in college. Rather, I found out via another classmate (another
Brenda!) that this Brenda, who lives in Chicago, is also combatting advanced OC, since
2017 it turns out. She's been through several runs of chemo, radiation, debulking
surgery, and more, but seemed upbeat (is very much about the 'being in the now') and
looked quite glam to me (we share a passion for jewelry, which she likes to buy at
auction). She gave me her rationale for making long(er) range plans, which I've been
resisting b/c of all the uncertainty generated by my condition. Consequently, she's been
                       705 / 1.901
traveling up a storm, w/trips to Paris, Hawaii, a cruise in the Mediterranean etc. She
simply plans for contingencies, buying trip insurance, renting a hotel room to rest in if
she doesn't feel well when touring etc. Her encouragement to celebrate my half-bday in
September or October by planning a trip to Paris (which I've been thinking about
anyway) has had me scrolling through vbro and Airbnb listings since I got off zoom with
her! I look forward to keeping in touch with her and wish her wellness and peace of mind
(which she appears to have in abundance, in parallel w/a strong faith). Talking to her was
so helpful. I look forward to lunch with two of the ""III Cs"" next week, another source of
support.
The title of this entry was the last line of a dream I had a few weeks ago, related to my
retirement. I will try to relay the dream in another entry, but it's time for dinner so more
soon.
For anyone who might not have seen this, Penn State News published a nice story about
me on my retirement:

196,"My CA 125 number is 31.1 this month, up from 18 last month, a significant jump after six
months of stability on Zejula marked by just a gradual upward creep (the graphed results
show this starkly). While you will read online that 'normal' range for CA 125 is up to 35,
38, even 46, *my* normal is in the 11-13 range (at the time of my first, debulking
surgery my CA 125 level was over 200). I wasn't entirely surprised by this morning's
result as I have been having concerning symptoms for several weeks, as I reported
yesterday: discomfort on my right side; mild nausea; now a little bit of a 'tugging' feeling
in my lower abdomen and achy lower back, some weight gain. So when I opened the
Geisinger portal this morning and saw the result (after talking myself down to a rational
state), I simply said: ""Yep."" Then my thoughts and emotions started spinning out of
control again: fear, panic, sadness. ""Hmm - cancer is trying to make quick work of me."" I
drove to my three-month checkup with Dr. Patel in a bit of a daze, after sending Dr.
Beavis the results.
I felt much better after speaking with him. He and Dr. Beavis concur that I need to be
scanned, and this will happen a week from tomorrow (I'm going to see if I can move it
up, but I presume I may not be able to). Dr. Patel examined me and felt no lumps or
masses. My lungs sound clear. He determined that there is no blockage b/c although I
have some mild nausea I am not vomiting, am moving my bowels etc. (sorry to be so
graphic!). A blockage would not be good. He also feels my blood counts and liver marker
numbers are all fine, very important for what may lie ahead. Beyond that, Dr. Patel
doesn't linger on hypotheticals; he wants to scan first, then make a determination about
next steps if they are to materialize. As always, he's very focused on my 'living my best
life' in the present, encouraged me strongly to attend my friend Maria's wedding in NH
later this month, make other longer-range plans for the 1-3 months ahead etc. (he
doesn't want to discourage even *longer-range* plans, but prefers I not get too far ahead
of myself right now!). He also told me he would never venture to pronounce definitively
on prognosis, as in ""you have two years"" etc., which is what the college friend I zoomed
                       707 / 1.901
with yesterday was told. Each case is different. Dr. Patel was kind and matter of fact,
asked about Ben and my mother, gave me a hug (which I initiated), held my hand when I
started crying etc. (in a completely professional way).
When I worried that I had again moved too belatedly on this after several weeks of
symptoms, Dr. Patel reminded me that deciding when to treat (cancer) is something of
an art; if you intervene too early, you may quickly exhaust treatment options.
It also appears that a pattern *may* (and I stress 'may') be emerging, my pattern: six
months of 'honeymoon' (as I've experienced this Jan-June), followed by a treatment
cycle. If it turns out that cancer is the issue here -- and if I were a betting woman I'd put
my money on that -- this will be the second iteration of that pattern. Dr. Beavis told me
OC can work that way, but it doesn't always.
Also wanted to add (sorry for the choppiness but I'm a bit scattered today), that
'recurrence' may be something of a misnomer as my cancer never fully disappeared,
despite Dr. Beavis' valiant efforts to remove all the visible cancer during my debulking
surgery. Some always lingered, new cancer cells emerged that are not daunted by
Zejula, that may be what's happening now and if so, another line of treatment may be
needed. I *hate* the thought of having my body host these nasty uninvited guests. Wish
I could kick 'em to the curb... or worse.
Meanwhile, Dr. Beavis had emailed me very quickly, also saying ""we need to scan."" ""This
may be nothing"" she wrote,""but the symptoms are concerning."" She offered to place the
order for the scan but Dr. Patel had already done so. She's on it. I will send her the
results so she can consult with Dr. Patel.
Dr. Patel prescribed a low dose of oxycodone if I'm feeling uncomfortable. I haven't slept
well the past three nights and the discomfort on my right side actually does hinder my
getting into a comfortable position. I'm yearning for a restful, peaceful sleep.
After seeing Dr. Patel, I had my chemo port flushed as I do every six weeks. The nurses
are extremely kind, and I stopped to chat with one in particular whom I like a lot. I must
say that the staff in Dr. Patel's office is kindly. No harm in being called ""darling"" by the
receptionist or ""Miss Willa"" by the intake nurse! The chemo nurses themselves have a
much more extensive skill set, of course, which is reassuring.
I was glad my friend Helen and I had arranged to meet at my office to pack up boxes of
my books both because she's a wonderful, empathic, caring friend and I love to spend
time her and because focusing on a rather mundane activity helped take my mind off the
other stuff. Although I need to refrain from heavy lifting at this point, we still made a lot
of progress. 
                       708 / 1.901
I feel pretty drained right now so will try to relax this evening. Then I suppose I have a
mini-reprieve until my scan next Friday. I am glad to have two lunches planned for next
week, one, coincidentally, with at least two of my 'teal sisters' or ""III Cs,"" as we call
ourselves, local OC survivors, the other with my friend Kathryn. I'd be happy to 'fill up my
dance card' a bit more next week to discourage me from fixating on worst case
scenarios, so if any State College friends reading this would be free for lunch, coffee, a
walk, a drive etc. next week I would welcome that!
What else do I need or not need right now? Not need: pity; questions in hushed voices
about my prognosis; conspicuous avoidance of my medical condition; conspicuous
avoidance of me. Need: contact and communication (quick notes, emails, texts, hugs
welcome - if you can); prayers; laughs; being treated normally; empathy combined with
a matter of fact attitude, veering not towards pollyanna-ish optimism nor towards
doomsday scenarios (however, if you must choose I prob. prefer option #1 over option
#2). Feel free to ask questions. And please let me know what I can do for *you* in my

On Saturday (7/9), Willa wisely had a close friend/neighbor bring her to the Mount
Nittany Medical Center ER to have them examine areas that were bothersome and
concerning. After a scan, she was admitted and is still under their care. Her remarkably
attentive team of Dr’s. Patel and Beavis are in the loop, communicating and will assess
the situation further on Monday. Should you wish to reach out to us, please feel free to
contact me (her brother) or son Ben (who is currently on his way from Brooklyn to State

message (or Caring Bridge too). Many thanks for all the continued love and support.

198,"Back home, thankfully. Was discharged at about 4 p.m. Ben was with me and Sammi was
waiting in the car. I just took a hot shower as I felt really grimy (no shower in my room
and toilet in the corner...). Ben plugged in my laptop and brought me sparkling water
with ginger to drink as I lie on my bed, typing. The kids are watching the Euro soccer
final in the sun room.
I woke up Friday morning vomiting bile, which I don't think I've ever done. Bile tastes
vile. I could not identify the cause. I wrote both my oncologists to ask if/when they
thought I should go to the ER. Neither responded for quite a while, which is unusual.
Finally, Dr. Patel wrote that if my symptoms worsened I should go to the ER. When I was
already in the ER, having decided I need to get myself checked out there, Dr. Beavis'
nurse called me to say that Dr. B. wanted me to go to the ER ASAP (she had been in a
meeting all day but they were able to get a message to her, to which she responded). I
also called my brother because he gives very good advice and is very rational, and he
also counseled me to err on the side of caution. So I asked my kind neighbor Janis to
drive me, which she was happy to do, in addition to praying over me once we got to the
hospital. I wasn't feeling great, nothing ultra-specific, just not great.
Once in an ER bay, it was quickly determined to do a CT scan. As is, I was/am already
scheduled for a CT scan this Wednesday, as warranted by the significant rise in my CA
125 number this past week. But as it turned out this was expedited. In the meanwhile, a
nurse or two were doing various things, I don't remember what -- taking blood, certainly.
When the ER dr. came (back) in, after I had the CT scan, he sighed and said ""there's a lot
going on here"" (I had updated him that I was in treatment for OC, to which he said ""I'm
sorry.""). The immediate problem/lower hanging fruit was an impaction of stool causing
constipation, which actually came as a surprise to me. That also explains why I was
vomiting bile (I think), as 'things' were forced to come up rather than go down and out.
So during my hospital stay that got worked out, thankfully. As a result of all the bile I
vomited (and there was a lot), my electrolytes went out of whack, especially my
potassium, which can have damaging effects on the heart etc. So that also got worked
out with big infusions of potassium and potassium pills, which I'll continue to take.
The more concerning news of course involves apparently new mets (metastases) of my
OC onto my lower lung (three nodules on one lung and then this fluid issue on the right),
peritoneum, and a lymph node on my belly, plus some tumors. At least this is how the
doctor described it to me. The radiologist, I think, did not compare this CT to the
previous one but to an earlier one, so it's not exactly clear to me what has progressed.
But I surmise there's been progression, perhaps significant. N.b. that my OC has been
metastatic since the very beginning. The hospital dr. (once I was admitted) messaged
Dr. Patel to let him know what was going on. Dr. Patel messaged that he wasn't surprised
at the finding given my elevated CA 125 number, and that he would consult w/Dr. Beavis
                       716 / 1.901
tomorrow. It wasn't really until then that I though to myself: ""Duh. Of course, we've been
waiting for a recurrence all along."" OC is a recurrent cancer, and I've already had one.
It's rather the extent of the recurrence, as far as I can tell, that scares me. The hospital
dr. reassured me somewhat by reminding me of all the tremendous advances made in
cancer treatment in recent years.
I was admitted for observation and that didn't go too smoothly. The first nurse
immediately asked me, ""Where's your husband?"" I felt my second nurse was treating me
like a sack of potatoes rather than a person, and had to beg her to show compassion
given the news I had just received. She sort of barked at me: ""I understand, I had
leukemia and survived it. Then I knew that God had a plan for me."" (aside: I too believe I
have a purpose to fulfill in life, which I may or may not live to fill out -- just sayin'). That
nurse eventually softened and we wound up on ok terms. My hunch is that the staff is
really burned out post-COVID. Many patients died. A new hospital administration
replaced a large portion of the staff. So the vibe at MNMC is not the best...unfortunately.
My mind was racing and all the stages of grief were crashing down on me simultaneously
-- intense fear, intense sadness, anger, frustration, gratitude (no acceptance yet). My
mental circuits were completely overcharged in this alien environment. Sobbing.
Careening wildly between my past and my future. Big-time FOMO. Trying to imagine
what the docs will say tomorrow (surgery? chemo? radiation? we can't do anything for
you?). A psych liaison and then a psychiatrist came down and simply listened to me and
validated all my feelings. That helped. II took some Ativan. The cloud lifted a bit more
when I made touch with family and a few key friends to let them know what was going
on. Yesterday morning my angels Ben and Sammi rushed to grab the 10:30 Megabus
from the city and were here by 4:00. Being able to hug them significantly lifted my
mood.
While I didn't sleep great the first night (not easy when being wakened every few hours
to have vitals taken and with staff yakking in the hallway), the second night I actually
slept pretty well, from 8:30 to 6:30. The jovial male night nurse who complimented my
hamsa bracelet and told me not to snore too loudly made me giggle.  Oddly enough, my
mind made space for some pleasant images: large flat shifting planes of sea green and
blue, almost like an abstract ocean seen from above. Calming. Also nice images of the
men I've loved (truly loved), with lots of long-ago details (like the dress I wore on our first
date) and some of the background theme music that I forever associate with each one
(such as Joan Armatrading's ""Love and Affection"" for one who has passed on...). It was
very pleasant, romantic! Such a reprieve, such beauty in the midst of my despair.
Speaking of despair, I was also holding on to the title of this blog, ""On the Narrow
Bridge,"" which cautions, per Rabbi Nachman of Breslow, that although the entire world is
a narrow bridge, the most important thing is not to give in to despair. And speaking of
Nachman of Breslow, my rabbi called me in the hospital, which lifted me too; we'll be in
touch again soon. Michael also came to visit briefly. I am so thankful for our solid
                       717 / 1.901
friendship which has made it so much easier for the whole family, and Ben especially, to
weather this storm.
I'm in a calmer place now, but feel rather drained. I feel badly that Ben and Sammi have
to tend to me; I'd much rather be taking them out to dinner in Brooklyn, as I did about
two weeks ago. They're a great team.
Tomorrow's a new day, hopefully with a new plan. I know that Dr. Beavis is a dragon-

199,"No word from my oncologists today. Dr. Patel is out of the office. And so I wait.
Frustrating.
I feel rather slothful. I don't have much pep. My side is sore. I did manage to write a
letter of recommendation. And I received in the mail two copies of the French history
magazine, _Historia,_ in which a short article of mine appears. So the day isn't a total
wash. My compulsion to be productive.
Sammi and Ben are giving me the immense gift of a calming, normalizing environment.
Right now they are cooking shakshuka and heating up my tomato soup. They take stock
of what I need around the house and will order it for me (eg a new can opener, a wooden
cutting board as I only have a glass one right now, perhaps a bagel guillotine). Sammi
picked up a cappuccino for me. I had enough energy to cook beets and Ben and I
collaborated on a beet, mozza and basil salad, with basil I grew (I think it's my first ever
success w/beautiful robust basil, two varieties). My mind is on cooking, which is a good
sign. I am itching to watch either ""Ottolenghi and the Cakes of Versailles"" or ""Summer of
                       721 / 1.901
Soul"" tonight. It's been storming on and off today but now the sun is out. I feel so much
calmer than during my hospital stay.
I did sleep well although I still feel tired today. I had an epic dream, or a dream that was
an epic. I was out for a night of clubbing, solo, in some dark, lively underground club(s?).
Looking good, wearing stiletto heels and a dress with a tight bodice, cinched at waist, full
flouncy skirt [note: in the hospital I was texting pictures from our thirtieth reunion to a
friend/classmate; I was wearing a killer black dress for the Saturday night party, which
was fantastic fun]. Don't remember too much about what I was actually doing in the
club, but there was a subplot about two young women who looked up to me/wanted my
approval. One was my niece, Maya (niece on Michael's side), who strangely in the dream
was named 'Clotilde,' the other was a young woman (both 20-somethings) who was
strolling with her boyfriend but was showing off her brown suede boots to me to garner
my approval.
The significant part of the dream is that I lost my black purse, which I had taken with me
to the club. I had put it on a ledge so as not to be encumbered by it. The purse had
*everything* in it: cell phone (communication, contact, mobility), cash (freedom,
possibilities, survival?), id card (identity), more. If the purse was lost I risked losing all
those things, as I suppose I do during this latest health setback. Btw, I don't believe the
purse was stolen, but maybe it was. There was just so much commotion in the club and
so many black purses that mine simply went astray.
Initially, I accepted that the purse was lost. Then the self-question became: ""How much
effort are you willing to make to get all of this back?"" I decided that I couldn't give up so
easily. So I walked through the club to a lost and found (?), where I saw several black
purses similar to mine as well as several handbag straps that looked familiar. But none
of the bags were mine. At a certain point, I simply gave up on trying to reclaim the purse
and its contents. So I left the club empty-handed, also aware that it was 1 a.m. and that
someone, I don't know who, needed to be alerted to that fact or was waiting for me as I
was out late.
The strange end to the dream: exiting this netherworld of clubland at 1 a.m., I was
blinded by bright sunshine, as if it were a sunny summer morning. People were walking
the streets, the city was abuzz. I was stupified. Since I no longer had my purse, I debated
walking to my destination but was constrained by my stiletto heels and also by the
thought that it might be dangerous if it were really 1 a.m. and I was somehow being
lured into thinking it was daytime. Day for night in this topsy-turvy, Alice through the
Looking-Glass World. Curiouser and curiouser...
My therapist pointed out today that in my real life an army of supporters would likely
have been helping me find my black purse and its contents, essential in some sense to
my survival. Please help me find my black purse!

As of right now (6:35 Tuesday), I haven't spoken directly with either Dr. Beavis or Dr.
Patel, but the emails were flying fast and furious with the nurses this morning. This is
what I know so far: 1) Dr. Beavis is going to discuss my case with the 'tumor board' in
her service, where she can receive the most expert advice about what may be the best
treatment plan for me (this is why I go to Hopkins...). 2) One possibility, all things being
equal (eg if I'm eligible, location etc.), is for me to enter a clinical trial. My longtime
impression that a clinical trial is a wacky last-ditch effort has since been proved totally
erroneous. Clinical trials are based on the most cutting edge research and always have
to meet the standard of care of more standard treatments. They can be quite promising,
but there is less data about their success rate. 3)More chemo with a new (for me) drug
combo is also a possibility. 
That's pretty much all I know. I don't know if there are other options other than clinical
trial/chemo. My hunch is that nothing will happen before next week, but after that it's a
series of question marks. Ben and Sammi are still here (bless them), but may be leaving
on Thursday. I have no idea what my needs may be going forward; it will depend on the
treatment plan.
I'm feeling calmer, despite the potential seriousness of the setback (which was not
unexpected with OC). The hospital stay was awful; aside from the trauma of learning of
my recurrence, I really think our local hospital has worsened a few notches since COVID,
a major change of staff, and the arrival of new hospital administrators. I went to the
farmers market today and may do some cooking, but carrying the heavy bag from the
market tugged on my abdomen, so I must avoid that. I am so happy to be at home, at
my kitchen table brightened by a vase of sunflowers the kids placed there. Was able to
do some work today, including making good headway on providing (overdue...) feedback
on a dissertation chapter by one of our grad students -- a very interesting read.
I am certain that the 'dragon-slayer' and her team will come up with the best possible
treatment plan for me.
More updates as I have them. Thanks to each of you for your concern and love. In such
trying situations, it's amazing how such elemental emotions as love can come to the
fore.

                       728 / 1.901
Just as I pushed the 'publish' button on yesterday's entry, Dr. Beavis called me. V. glad I
published right before a crazy storm hit, killing our electricity and internet for four hours
and leaving the three of us to sit in the dark playing ""20 Questions"" by candlelight, while
the sky outside hissed and crackled with electric current and the sky turned shades of
apocalyptic red and dark gray. The power returned about 12:40 but today -- wait for it --
the air conditioning is out (until it can hopefully be repaired on Friday). Nothing like
sweltering in an 80 degree house. Oy vey. When it rains... (and boy, did it ever).
In between pressing 'push' and the onset of the Apocalypse, I spoke with Dr. Beavis for
about 30-45 minutes. As ever, the Dragonslayer was upbeat, thorough, patient,
supremely knowledgeable. She thinks highly of Dr. Patel and the two of them apparently
work very well together. Here is what I know: a) Surgery is not a good option for me and
could actually hurt me as it works best if it's been at least a year since last recurrence
(for me, it's been over seven months, which fortunately puts me over the fateful six-
month mark under which treatment becomes significantly dicier). Hearing that my future
portends no surgery was a relief; b)Radiation would not be helpful; c)she will consult
w/the Hopkins (gyn) tumor board on Friday to see if her colleagues can suggest plans
that make more sense than her own; d)it's unlikely I'll be eligible for a clinical trial right
now (I think it might have to do with my BRCA negative status), but she was checking
one final piece of information to confirm; she gave me the link enabling me to read
about all the clinical trials currently being conducted around the country, in case a new
study emerges for which I might be eligible (at Sloan, for example) down the road; e) it is
likely, although not definite, that I will receive a new course of chemo combining
carboplatin (which I've had before) and gemzar (which I haven't). f)A PET scan is not
warranted at this time; Dr. Beavis would only pursue if there was any suspicion of cancer
having metastasized to my brain (if I had persistent headaches and nausea, which I do
not). However, today Dr. Patel ordered a CT of my lungs for Monday to see if there any
findings that need evaluation. So I suppose that my treatment plan will be finalized next
week sometime. In the meantime, I'm 'detoxing' from the parp inhibitor (daily chemo pill
that I did quite well on for seven + months), clearing my system for the next series of
drugs.
If more chemo is in my future, Dr. Beavis said I would experience hair thinning but I've
just read that this combo makes you in fact  lose all your hair, which in the scheme of
things is not my ultimate concern, by any means. She explained two different timetables
for receiving this chemo, but I need to know more. The spread of my cancer around my
abdomen and pelvis is not uncommon. The nodules on my lungs are tiny; the amount of
fluid on my right side is tiny; she doesn't understand why I have discomfort there but
prescribed megadoses of ibuprofen and Tylenol. She is performing another test on my
tumor (a piece of which was saved during debulking!) to gather further information
about possible genetic mutations.
                       729 / 1.901
I was also very happy to hear Dr. Beavis mention two other chemo regimens that she is
keeping ""in her back pocket"" for future recurrences. She and Dr. Patel are being very
mindful of the sequencing and types of treatments for  this chronic recurring condition.
After speaking with Dr. Beavis and then enduring four hours of a power outage, I found it
really tough to sleep -- but not in a bad way. I felt so reassured after speaking with this
wonderful doctor. I was simply feeling intensely carpe diem-ish, and even contemplated
getting out of bed and laying into my to-do list. Sometime around 2 a.m. ""time's winged
chariot,"" per Marvell, was hurrying at my back, but the mantra speaking to me even
more loudly came from a book I used to enjoy reading Ben: Dr. Seuss' _Marvin K.
Mooney, will you please go now!:"" ""Please go, go, GO! Please do, do, DO!"" So I am back
to going and doing. Around 3 a.m. I was mentally recording in the wonderful blank recipe
book I received as a retirement gift the chicken soup recipe I have perfected over the
years, w/dozens of little hints and tips that I want to pass on to Ben when I eventually
'bequeath' him the book. Around 4 a.m. I was hoping I could get to my friend's wedding
next weekend and planning how to accessorize the dress I ordered to wear to it from my
favorite store in Paris (still sitting in the post office; hope it fits).
Despite the insomnia I was actually in a very happy place mentally and emotionally,
feeling that my doctors had snatched me back from the depths and set me back on the
practical path of treating my disease. So while ovarian cancer is undoubtedly an awful
disease, you should not imagine that I'm anywhere near 'the end' - at all. That was
totally the message from Dr. Beavis as well -- who knows that I don't want to hear about
'timelines' or anything like that until we've reached the end of effective treatments, at
which point she'll be candid with me. But I reiterate that this is nowhere in my near
future, should you be imagining the contrary.
Cancer is so strange.
Things that made me happy/grateful today:
>Receiving a gorgeous bouquet from a very dear, special and beloved 'ame soeur'
[=soul sister] (circumflex accent over the 'a' plus the Latin alphabet grapheme oe>don't
have the right keyboard with me!), whom I will thank personally v. soon. The gorgeous
sunflowers, pink roses and lilies are glorious to behold and have been in my view most of
the day as I work at the kitchen table.
>Lunch with two of my 'teal sisters' or ""III Cs,"" as we call our group of OC survivors who
meet up once in a while to trade news and updates. One of them, Deb, is a twelve-year
survivor who has had *seven* recurrences, and who knows a thing or two about making
plans (>ie you make them), living in the moment, resilience, and OC as a chronic,
treatable condition like diabetes or Chron's disease.
>Ok, to be crassly materialistic: makeup shopping at ULTA. Clinique concealer, Urban
                       730 / 1.901
Decay shimmery gold eyeshadow (""Dumb Luck"") and blue eye pencil (""Chaos""). I loved
the young salesperson, who looked to be about eighteen, sporting a glittery palette of
eye shadow that would have given Bowie a run for his money. In fact, I really hope this
fellow has discovered Bowie. Instead of coordinating my dress with makeup in the same
palette, he encouraged me to 'go bold or go home,' with contrasting and/or unexpected
colors. So the peach tones of the dress may keep company with blue eye pencil (a color I
rarely wear). We'll see how this experiment pans out.
about to do some cooking now: pesto, peach cobbler. Ben and Sammi leaving tomorrow
for the weekend but several close friends are around.
Happy Bastille Day! Joyeuse fete [circumflex accent on first 'e'] nationale!

202,"Updates: 1) Had chest CT today to make sure all the critical areas are covered. Was told
the radiologists here would likely not read the scans for a week (!); I hope Dr. Beavis'
team can read them more quickly; 2)Will be starting a new course of chemo -- every
other week -- next Wednesday with one drug I've had before (carboplatin) and one I
haven't (gemcitabine). Dr. Beavis consulted with her 'tumor board' and the consensus
was that this would be the best course for me and also the next logical step in the
sequence of treatments usually given to OC patients who are not platinum resistant. I
have purposely avoided looking for info on this combo and possible side effects for fear
I'll be upset by what I read (feel free to Google away, should you wish); I'll wait until next
Tuesday when I speak with Dr. Patel. He'll review the results of the chest CT with me
                       734 / 1.901
(hopefully there will be no significant findings, he is simply doing 'due diligence') and talk
to me about the upcoming treatment. My support network here is solid -- one friend has
already tentatively offered to take me/pick me up/visit with me/bring me a milkshake
during chemo should I wish; another has let me know she can activate the Meal Train if
needed; a third, again so kindly, said she and her husband could finish packing up my
office on campus if needed so that the new head can settle in; a fourth sent me a
gorgeous necklace that she was given when she started her own OC journey in 2015; it's
silver, and bears the cancer ribbon plus the Hebrew inscription ""Chazak ve'ematz"" [""be
strong and of good courage""]. I am so touched by this gesture, Rhonda, and will be
thanking you very soon! I love this idea of 'teal sisters' providing ""strength from a
communal place of caring,"" per the lovely card accompanying the necklace; a fifth
friend, in Boston, sent a kind note to let me know I was in her thoughts. I am so
incredibly buoyed by all these gestures of love, caring and support.
I have no idea how the new drugs will affect me, but I'll soon find out. I simply hope that
they are not too debilitating. I'll be ready.
 
Meanwhile, lifted up by my new 'teal sister' (and college classmate) Brenda's mantra of
""first the scans, then the plans,"" I am heading this Thursday to N. Conway, NH, to the
wedding of a close friend  here. Five of us will make the drive together, in a minivan
rented for the occasion, including two PSU friends (a couple, one of whom is a
physician!), the bride's mother and one of the bride's sons, who coincidentally took two
classes with me. I'll have a free day to lounge by the pool, take a walk in town,  etc.
before the wedding on Saturday. I have a killer dress, ordered from Paris (but a bit too
tight; hope I can squeeze myself into it) and found some pretty hair clips in poppy and
coral organza that match some of the shades in the dress, described by  friend as
""Gauguinesque."" Probably some fairly understated pearl earrings and bracelet plus gold
sandals.
And in ""first the scans, then the plans"" Part II, I booked a week at a beach front hotel in
Amagansett in mid-August for myself, Ben, and hopefully Sammi for a long weekend.
We'll have a small kitchen in which to cook up produce and seafood from the farmers
market. It is not lost on me that -- and not to gloat, but... -- while my colleagues are
preparing syllabi I'll be on the beach w/a good novel, toes in the ocean after savoring a
lobster roll for lunch. I look forward to a chill, fun week. I just hope the new chemo
cocktail doesn't knock me out.
Other happy moments of the past/next few days: a)Sunday morning coffee w/my friend
Helen on the shady porch of Café Lemont -- so relaxing and so much fun to hang out; b)a
visit from my friend and soon to be bride Maria; c)a lovely walk/talk this morning at the
Military Museum with my friend Jackie (another ""IIIC"" who understands *exactly* what I
                       735 / 1.901
am going through and views it as I do as an anticipated setback, which will be
overcome); d)Ben's return from MA, which inspired some culinary creativity on my part
(zucchini stuffed w/ground beef, rice, pine nuts, parsley, craisins, nutmeg and allspice;
baked peaches with crème fraîche); e)tomorrow's visit from my dear friend from grad
school, Isabelle, and her equally dear husband, Rob. Rob's family has a home in PA so Isa
and Rob will drive down from there for dinner, stay over, and then depart on Wednesday.
Giggling is guaranteed!; f)a number of other texts, emails, FB messages and not so
random acts of kindness; g)four essays I am reading by Oliver Sacks, whose writing I
love, grouped together under the title _Gratitude._ He wrote them in the final months of
his life. Poignant and clear-sighted.
I'm a lucky woman.
P.S. A few people have mentioned to me that they no longer receive notifications from
CB when I have posted. I apologize for this and unfortunately cannot proffer an
explanation. Perhaps check w/CB? Reregister on the site?
P.P.S. A number of people have complimented me on my blog, its writing etc. (merci).
W/out going into too much detail here, my creative energy right now is strongly tending
towards trying to create a performance piece from it (currently 200 entries and going
strong - ""an incredible archive,"" per Ben), which would incorporate music (I have a local
musician in mind to sing the title song -- ""The Narrow Bridge"" -- as well as a few other
pieces such as Debbie Friedman's ""Mi Shebeirach""). I was a theatre person in college but
do not have directorial experience. I am wondering whether I could sustain interest if this
were a one-woman show (ie is my story that compelling?) or whether I should try to
include other survivors (of whom I know many). But I also have to think about my
wherewithal in terms of energy, which would argue for a more modest scope. I see this
as a community-based project (to take place at Webster's bookstore? Elsewhere?) and as
a fundraiser for cancer causes and/or Caring Bridge. Its raison d'être? Awareness,
visibility, connection around issues of mortality, pain, care, gratitude, friendship and
other recurring themes in my blog. I welcome any and all ideas (seriously), including
dismissal of my concept as balderdash, self-indulgent drivel. Seriously.

Maria and Greg got married! Under a brilliant blue July sky framed by pine trees and the
White Mountains of New Hampshire, and with Stonehurst, summer residence of the
robber baron-ish Bigelow family, serving as a backdrop. The sunlight, crisp air, bright
color palette, and classical music drifting through the ceremony all seemed especially
vivid to me. The couple's parents and adult children beamed, the bride's younger brother
made a heartfelt toast, a lovely luncheon was served, there was dancing. My convivial
table mates included a (formerly PSU) American historian and her documentary
filmmaker husband, a native NY-er like myself; a former bf of the bride; and two longtime
buddies of the groom, who hails from New Hampshire.
I managed to decompress from a mind-bogglingly long (10+ hour) drive to New
Hampshire (spent in the good company of Maria's mother, son [a former student of mine,
coincidentally] and two State College friends, one the officiant at the wedding) with a
relaxing day discovering the cute town of N. Conway, NH, easing into a mani-pedi, book
buying (_All the Light We Cannot See_), treating myself to a nice dinner at a farm to
table place, and being massaged by the jets in the hotel jacuzzi. Slept well all three
nights, although one sleep punctuated by a dream pitting the Nazis v. the Resistance. I
knew of my quasi-inevitable fate (ie death) as a Jew being tracked by the Nazis, but still
attempted to beat it by trying to glean clues from a cabbie named ""Leon"" (?) whose
name, I surmised, contained some sort of useful clue or code that I might need to
escape. The story's ending remained unclear.
I wore the killer dress and the pretty organza flowers in my hair to the wedding and
received the requisite (and appreciated) oohs and aahs on Facebook when I posted a few
pics. I *did* feel well that day and imbued with a certain feminine power and confidence.
Were these affirmations from folks who know my 'real' condition and are cheering me
on? From folks who may be misled into thinking that I'm 'all better?' Was this my 'last
hurrah' (hope not)? No matter, it was fun to dress up and attend a party and dance; I've
always enjoyed that.
My luncheon companion to my right (one of the groom's buddies), Bob, an interesting
guy who has lived mainly in China and traveled widely in Asia, told me that his wife
passed away just a few months ago: colorectal cancer that metastasized to the liver and
eventually the brain: ""It was simply awful to see this brilliant, vibrant woman completely
disintegrate."" Gulp. I tapped on my port and shared that I too was surviving with
advanced metastatic cancer and perhaps had some inkling of the shock and grief he was
experiencing. That was a 'narrow bridge' moment for me. It made me think of those
game shows I used to watch when I would be home sick from grade school, ""Let's Make a
Deal,"" for example. Behind door 1 there's a new car, door 2 opens to reveal a new dining
room set, and the curtain rises on door 3 to reveal ... bupkis. Behind which door does my
fate lie? Will it play out as it did for Bob and his wife (certainly plausible)? As it currently
                       746 / 1.901
is for my college classmate/'teal sister' Brenda, who's been contending with terrible
headaches and nausea that have led her dr. to order an MRI of her brain (plausible too)?
As it is for my ""III C"" pal Deb, seven recurrences and counting after twelve years?
(plausible, I suppose)? Or as it has for my ""III C"" ladies Jackie and Helen (breast cancer
but no further OC recurrences)? So....much....uncertainty.
So tomorrow begins a new course of chemo. Cisplatin + gemzar, every two weeks, six
hours each time (the actual drugs will only drip into me for 1.5 hours, the other 4.5 hours
I'll be infused with other fluids). It's unclear for how long I'll receive this treatment; it will
depend on how it affects me. The list of possible side effects -- tinnitis/hearing loss, rash,
nausea/vomiting, neuropathy in fingers, decrease in red and white blood cells and
platelets - made my eyes glaze over. I hope my body will be strong. More than anything,
though, I hope that the drugs will beat back the cancer. Good that Dr. Patel did 'due
diligence' by ordering a CT scan of my chest, because there are indeed some small
nodules there now, along with an enlarged lymph node near my trachea (I forgot to ask
whether this means that tracheal cancer might be in my future).
I woke up one day recently scared. Is cancer trying to make quick work of me? So I go
back to the mantras: one day at a time; the important thing is not to give in to fear; be
strong and of good courage. Dr. Patel assured me that he'd be right there with me each
step of the way, and will tweak the amount of drugs I receive if need be. Obviously the
spreading isn't good news but hopefully it can be arrested. I feel grateful to be able to be
treated here in Sate College where I am comfortable, and very well supported by friends
and by my medical team (Dr. Beavis is consulting with Dr. Patel throughout). I'll have my
blood tested and my pelvis/abdomen/chest scanned regularly. Thank you  in advance --
all of you -- for directing healing energy my way. A doctor friend who was part of our
'caravan' on the ride to NH confirmed for me that a 'positive attitude' can really make a
difference physiologically. And most of the time I can count on that (my blood pressure
was a bit high today but that's probably b/c I am anxious).
A  visit from my dear friends Isabelle and Rob was a huge blessing last week!
Reminiscing about all the fun and silliness of our grad school days, catching up on
whatever is important in our lives (we each have one 25-30 yo son), and massive
giggling over both dinner on my little patio  and then breakfast the next morning at a
cute local breakfast place felt like balm to my spirit! Grateful for these solid,
longstanding, rich friendships.
Will try to report on tomorrow's chemo provided I have the fortitude to do so.

I got through my first chemo ok yesterday. Six hours: 1.5 for the two chemo drugs (1 +
.5); 4.5 for fluids, including electrolytes, a diuretic to make sure the meds were working
themselves through my kidneys (and which had me going to the bathroom every ten
minutes, tethered to my infusion pole); a bit of time for 'miscellany' (eg flushing out my
port, accessing/deaccessing). I am in a new chemo room that opened in January, so
much more comfortable and pleasant than the dingy one I started off in. This one is
larger, outfitted with windows (!!), ample bays for each patient, etc. The nurses are
wonderful, and I was lucky to have assigned to me yesterday my favorite, Tracey, a
divorced mom of two sons a bit younger than me who is skillful, and compassionate. I
enjoy chatting with her. No raging Trumpers in the chemo room (an unpleasant memory
from my pre-election course of chemo) but an equally obtrusive man whose phone
conversation reverberated throughout the room, as did his equally loud snoring
afterwards! My iPad had no charge, unfortunately, so I dozed a bit, sent messages to
friends, and had a few snacks (protein bars, Goldfish and water bottles à volonté in the
chemo room, plus my yogurt, peach, banana bread and Lacroix sparkling water brought
from home).
My reliable neighbor, Janis, drove me to Geisinger (about 10 mn from my home), while
my sister ""III C"" Jackie picked me up. We made the now ritual stop afterwards at Meyer's
Dairy for milkshakes (my treat to her this time). I came home to find a large freezer bag
by my front door; Michael had kindly brought me, as I requested, a large container of
                       758 / 1.901
Panera tomato soup, a comforting post-chemo meal. I crashed on the couch and woke up
a few hours later, feeling somewhat refreshed. Didn't move much all evening; the
Olympics made for good company.
Didn't sleep great. Awoke every hour or two, to make sure I was ok I suppose and in
anticipation of side effects. Felt a bit itchy at one point and was focused on keeping well-
hydrated. So I feel tired today but overall not too roughed up. We'll see what the next
days, weeks, months bring. As long as those cancer cells get zapped and my body can
handle the treatment without significant diminishing of quality of life (quite ok on that
score for now; SO grateful I can receive my treatment here rather than at Hopkins, but I
am apprehensive about any return trip to the hospital here, which in many ways I find
sub-par).
As always, I'm *immensely grateful* for all the expressions of caring and concern from
family and friends directed towards me over the last few days: texts and calls, responses
on my CB page, gifts (thank you, Paula!), chicken soup (merci, Monique!), offers to
grocery shop and run other errands for me, a promise of homemade borscht (Michael
and Sue) and carrot cake (a local friend, Scott) later today. Full disclosure: being a 'taker'
is not an unfamiliar role for me, and can actually feel quite good to me, yet at the same
time I often feel like I'm 'extorting' the kindness sent my way. Likely more to say about
that at some point, but I also hope I can repay (or pay forward) the love and care that
continue to envelope me like a warm blanket.
A few days ago my therapist and I were discussing items that I plan to carry with me in
my metaphorical 'knapsack' as I journey forward. I am *definitely and without any doubt*
taking all of you, perhaps first and foremost. I will likely *not* be taking the chorus of
Furies dominating some of the OC survivors Facebook pages I subscribe to; there is too
much conflicting information/misinformation there, too much catastrophizing (or perhaps
I'm just in denial about the inevitability of this?), with the terms ""hospice,"" ""angel gained
her wings,"" ""teal angel,"" etc. jumping out at me each time I sign on. But I *will* be taking
(for sure) the more measured, smart, well-considered, empathic support of my ""III Cs""
Jackie, Deb, Helen, Jan and now Brenda. There are several other items I may also be in
the midst of 'triaging;' perhaps I'll get to writing about them another time.
Thank you again, everyone. Your support is integral to my staying the course.
 
PS: Wonder Woman is crushin' those sneaky, aggressive cancer cells!
P.P.S. My writing today is probably a bit lazy and tired -- like me.  Can't seem to muster
the energy to find 'le mot juste,' but will likely revise at some point!

My 'back to school' muscles have retained their memory, leaving me disoriented and
confused as we round the bend into syllabi prep season. To wit: two vivid dreams on two
consecutive nights: 1) I've completely lost control of my class; students are walking in
and out of the classroom cavalierly and I can't stop them. The scene is spinning out of
control in other ways too (a persistent sound of sand or gravel crunching in the
background?). A former college classmate, Paul Tavrow, is calling me out for the disarray
but the chaos persists; 2) I'm at a conference and haven't written my paper. Somehow
I've become isolated from the conference regulars, the ones I usually hang out with, and
am with stuck with two older men who look like scholars from a previous generation (one
has a goatee). One of them uses the word ""Soviet"" in relation to his research (indicating
how antiquated it is, as in ""Soviet-era""). The three of us are traversing an uneven
landscape dotted with brown turds (!) [my thought here is that this may relate to the arid
soil in the community garden plot that I saw my former student/friend Yvonne
overturning in a video online yesterday].
I've long had these types of anxiety dreams as the spectre of the academic year's
beginning looms, but these had a nightmarish quality. Feeling 'adrift' and 'in transition'
for sure these days, the shakiness (walking on an uneven surface?) augmented by all the
other 'uncertainties' in my life right now. 'Getting a grip' seems fraught; perhaps
gentleness and self-compassion are the key.
On this chemo day +4, I'm at a strong ""B+"" -- feeling slightly tired and even more
slightly nauseous (did not even take an anti-nausea med today). Trying hard to be a
good patient>ample rest, ample hydration, healthy eating (need to start tossing some
exercise into the mix). Took a restorative multi-hour backroads drive yesterday: the corn
*is* (nearly) as high as an elephant's eye; the slant of light and mellow warmth hint ever
so slightly at back to school; Elk, Penn's and Spring Creeks glint and gurgle in the sun;
bales of hay dot the wide expanses of farmland. My country jaunt purchases included a
gold metal plate for change (looks vaguely Arabic in design) from my trusty antiques
store on Rte 45; a few ears of corn from a roadside stand; new potatoes from ""Mamy's
Donut Shop"" in Smulton; a luscious tomato from Yoder's farmstand near Aaronsburg, and
a dozen brown eggs from an Amish farm in Madisonburg ($1.75!).
Thank you, Jackie and Clare, for stopping by and to others of you for checking in. This
season is beautiful in Happy Valley - come visit!

208,"...and some dreams seem to convey the depth of my terror. Taking a short pre-lunch
break to write this one down so I don't forget it (although I'd like to):
In a movie theatre or some sort of auditorium to watch a film, performance etc. I believe
my mother is near (next to?) me. Suddenly conscious of a man entering the back of the
auditorium and sense that something ominous will happen. Most everyone seems to
have the good sense to crouch down between/below the seats; I do the same and push
my mother down too. An eerie stillness; we are obviously sitting ducks with no visible
means of escape. The guy has a gun. He ambles around the auditorium, not saying
anything, takes aim, then puts the gun down and walks away from it. We/I have literally
'dodged a bullet.' Huge relief yet still immense apprehension. I am frozen in terror. He
repeats this a second time: walks back to the gun, picks it up, takes aim, then puts it
down. I've dodged a bullet a second time. I am walking ""through the valley of the
shadow of death."" And yes, this happens a third time [= third course of chemo?], but I
sense he's getting closer. I can simply *feel it in my bones.* This time --in real time (not
in the dream) -- I literally bolt out of my bed to avoid getting shot and killed. Then I
realize it's a dream and go back to bed (about 4 a.m?).
These are the terrors that I try hard to keep at bay during the day as I go about my
business and that flood my dream sleep. Horribly frightening.
I think I'll go get a slice of pizza for lunch and then see if I can work on an article.

Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
                       770 / 1.901
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
 
George Michael - Faith (Official Video) - YouTube
 
Can't get George Michael, with his syncopated riff on having the faith in himself to hold
off an alluring yet dangerous lover, out of my head (by the way, I never realized that the
opening bars of organ music from ""Faith"" are actually lifted from ""I Don't Want Your
Freedom!"").
 
I guess I gotta have fa-f-fa-f-fa-f-faith when seeing my labwork results dotted with ""H""
(High) and ""L"" (Low) and when confirming that my CA 125 number had jumped over 20
points, from 31 to 52.6 (above 38 is considered outside normal range and my normal
usually falls between 11 and 13). I gotta have faith, as both Dr. Beavis' and Dr. Patel's
nurses or PAs told me, that it often takes several rounds of chemo to see a drop in the
CA125 number; moreover, it's likely that the jump up occurred during the several week
interval between my recurrence being diagnosed and the beginning of treatment, ie a
period when I was completely off chemo.
 
As for the blood work, I had been told that this chemo combo can be harsh on red blood
cells, white blood cells, platelets, kidneys, and liver (is anything else left?..... the heart, I
suppose). So I wasn't completely surprised by the results, ditto for the CA number, but of
course instinctively I wanted to see the numbers trend in the opposite direction. And I
surmised that my cells were not being sufficiently oxygenated when I felt myself
somewhat winded on exertion several times last week. My kidneys are apparently fine
(yay kidneys!), which means I've been diligently hydrating. One of my liver function
markers is high (or is that low?). The red blood cell counts are out of whack, ditto the
white blood cell and platelet counts. Counterintuitively, though, Dr. Patel's PA says I am
                       771 / 1.901
doing well (""I've seen worse"">HA!) and I'm certainly not in the 'critical' range at which
point treatment might need to be reassessed or a transfusion ordered. My blood will be
checked again before my second round next W, to see if anything has changed. In
theory, within two weeks the cells are supposed to rebound. Because of the low counts,
I'm now prone to bacterial infections, so must avoid gardening (I told the PA that the
most 'gardening' I do is to stick a plant into a pot and water it), pumping gas (rarely do it
myself), poor 'hand hygiene' (highly unlikely; I'm a compulsive hand washer), large
crowds, and other scenarios in which I might be exposed to bacteria.
 
At what point might the blood cell counts drop into truly troublesome range? What
happens then?  After how many rounds might I expect to see the CA125 number trend in
the opposite direction? After how many rounds is it determined that the treatment might
not, in fact, be working? And the cancer continues to grow and spread in the meantime?
So...much..uncertainty. 
 
But I gotta have faith...
 
I am feeling ok. I have energy to work at my desk, write emails, enjoy at least one social
outing a day, run errands, cook etc. Lifting heavy grocery bags is difficult for me, and not
advisable. Driving is no problem, enjoyable. At some point during the day I find myself
lying on the couch for a bit, but not necessarily napping. I try to sleep as much as I need
but struggle with insomnia some nights (even w/an over the counter sleep aid). Everyone
is telling I look great (WHO KNEW? Cancer is really hilarious sometimes). All kidding
aside, at times I do feel that I look as ""radiant"" as a friend recently claimed I do. I am
viewing life in technicolor with no filter, communicating soul to soul.  Is this a privilege
afforded those staring down their own mortality?

Loading up my social calendar has been a good antidote to getting up close and personal
with my mortality 24/7 (so has work; I've returned to an article that I'm very much
enjoying working on and know exactly where I want to send it). Have had lovely recent
visits with Clare (whom I hadn't seen for most of the summer); Jackie (thank you for
picking up groceries for me!); Scott (thank you for the massive piece of homemade
carrot cake); Helen (great catch-up lunch at Café Lemont); Sandy, Kathryn, and Cheryl
(what a treat to enjoy an excellent osso buco with three smart, sophisticated, interesting,
glam and martini-drinking women!); and Ted (lunch/coffee on  a bench at the Military
Museum Park, where we talked about everything and noticed the leaves turning yellow
on a peri-autumnal day).  This week hoping to see Monique, Katerina, and my former
dean (and now, fellow cancer survivor Susan). And tomorrow morning, Mary (and maybe
others) for a walk. I am grateful for the opportunity to share what's going on in our
respective lives. Soul to soul.
 
Drove out into the countryside today. The corn really is as high as an elephant's eye
now. Bought a few ears of corn at Yoder's farmhouse stand, while a Mennonite woman
conversed on her cell phone about whether she should buy the huge watermelon
weighing down the table. Bought a half bushel of plum tomatoes at the Amish farmers
market down the street. I'm feeling tomato sauce: all those fresh tomatoes, plus tomato
                       773 / 1.901
paste, onions, red wine, ground carrots, basil, bay leaves, garlic, eggplant and maybe a
zucchini. More like a cross between a sauce and a ratatouille. Hope I'll have the energy
to pull it off.

210,"I just reread my previous blog entitled ""Faith"" and it seems to me a bit flippant and even
breezy, lensed through pop songs. It wasn't so fun(ny) last night when my nose started
bleeding, because (I surmise) my platelet production is depressed. It was *not* bleeding
heavily at all, but my nasal membranes felt quite irritated and my nasal mucous was
bloody. This capped a day that effectively ended about 3 p.m. because I felt so wiped out
after walking four laps of the Military Museum track with my friends and then grocery
shopping at Wegmans. I was mad at myself for my sluggishness -- I had all sorts of plans
-- but had no choice but to succumb. I went to bed feeling sad and cancerous and bloody
and alone -- but managed to sleep pretty well (now that Nazi Germany and the French
Revolutionary Terror have been the backdrops for two of my dreams, I think only the
gulag is left...).
Better today! Turned my half bushel of plum tomatoes into two large pots full of fresh
tomato sauce (garlic, onion, zucchini, mushrooms, red wine, fresh basil, cayenne,
roasted eggplant, tomato paste) --by 11 a.m.! Therapy session. Iced latte run. A few
hours on campus with a colleague to take care of business straddling the last academic
year and the coming one. Trader Joe's run ( TJ's 'captain,' Nancy, noticed my port and
'outed herself' as a metastatic breast cancer survivor, working eleven-hour days while
undergoing some tough chemo. Didn't know this lady, but had a beautiful ten minute
conversation with her - soul to soul. She too is Jewish and I showed her the necklace I
was wearing with the Hebrew inscription meaning ""Be strong and of good courage"").
Emails. And I'm still vertical, as my late father-in-law would say.
On my Sunday walk w/my two friends yesterday, one had good news to share, the other
not so good. The ups and downs of life - the All of It. I'm glad we could be so present for
each other.

A shortish update: Round #2 of chemo went smoothly yesterday. While my red and
white blood cell and platelet counts are still wonky (to be expected with the harsh drugs
pumped into my bloodstream), they've avoided falling into critical range, thereby
forestalling any need to hold off on treatment or consider a transfusion. On the better
news front, my liver numbers looked significantly healthier yesterday (they are
'normalizing') and my kidney function is good (one of the few realms I have control over
via hydration, so bring on those fluids!).
What I've been terming 'uncertainty' might better be labeled 'navigating.' This emerged
as the mot du jour yesterday. Dr. Patel needs to *navigate* between safe and effective
treatment. Because of the concerns re my red and white blood cells (and platelets), I
must have a low(er) dose of the treatment, but not so low as to be ineffective. It's a
numbers game. If the blood cell counts improve, perhaps he can consider a higher dose.
A higher dose at this point might entail the risk of severe damage to my white blood
cells>bone marrow, which in the worst case scenario could necessitate a bone marrow
transplant. And we don't want that. So for now we are navigating the high seas of the
chemo ocean, in the hopes that we'll start to see some improvement in the cancer
marker later this month (unlike the disappointing twenty point rise we saw this time, also
not unusual).
I don't feel too badly today. I slept pretty well but am tired. Only mild nausea. It is
sweltering today (I can feel the heat seeping through my study window as I type), so for
the most part I'll stay inside and rest, but I've already succeeded in writing a few emails.
I wrote to both Drs. Patel and Beavis to see when I can get in line for the booster shot to
be offered (so I read in the _NYTimes?_) to immunosuppressed and other categories of
vulnerable people.
My chemo day was long, 9:30-5:00, including labwork, a meeting with Dr. Patel's PA to
go over the results, and a brief meeting w/Dr. Patel, who explained why he can't raise
my dose right now. The hours somehow passed quickly enough, though. Had great plans
to read, but mainly texted with friends and even dozed for a while. The nurses, as
always, were kind, friendly and attentive. The final two hours I receive a diuretic that has
me going to the bathroom every twenty minutes - not fun. My bighearted neighbor Janis
drove me to Scenery Park in the morning and my wonderful friend (and OC survivor)
Jackie picked me up and took me to Meyers Dairy for the ritual milkshake (I opted for a
rootbeer float w/Chocolate Almond ice cream - so refreshing). My appetite is ridiculously
healthy and I fear that soon I will have regained all the weight I've lost in the past two
years -- almost 30 pounds. I was definitely too scrawny post-first surgery and can't say I
look overweight now (by any means), but I was hoping to come in at at least ten pounds
under my pre-chemo weight. Oh well. It's 'insurance,' I guess, for what may lie ahead,
and the docs seem to think I'm at the right weight (apologies for this utterly vain
                       779 / 1.901
digression).
A piece of good news: I have the 'all clear' to head to the beach next week for vacay! I'll
spend the week at an oceanfront hotel in Amagansett, LI (Ben will be w/me and then
Sammi for the weekend). Weather looks perfect. Anticipating reading a novel (or more)
in a beach chair w/my toes dangling in the ocean, poolside relaxation, food
shopping/cooking (lobster? ceviche? scallops/shrimp and pasta? Roadside clam shacks?),
time w/a dear high school friend, a bit of local tourism. Aim to keep it very chill. I'll drive
to NJ this coming Monday and meet Ben at the NJ Transit station, from where he'll take
over the driving. Return scheduled for the 24th in time for my labs, with chemo the next
day. I can't wait for a week to clear my mind, body and spirit with loved ones.

Chemo tomorrow. Bloodwork earlier today. I see some of the results have come in, and
I'll receive the CA 125 result tomorrow. I don't want to look yet (too anxious), but I'll do
so (I think) before chemo. I'm worried about the possibility that my CA 125 may have
risen again. I'm concerned that there is a lymph node with cancer on it lying against my
stomach. Perhaps it might be removed? Must ask. Am feeling generally well overall. I get
winded on exertion (that's the chemo targeting my red and white blood cells). Cancer is
with me 24/7 though, for sure, and dread is never too far from the surface. But I keep on
keepin' on.
Vacation in Amagansett helped.
This Pisces loves water and the elements were healing. Sun, wind, surf, sand, clouds. I
did need to cover b/c of chemo-related sun sensitivity. The first day on the beach, I
dozed somewhat troubledly, as if my mind needed to rid itself of some bile (there was
also a strange dream that first night, which I'll relay later). The following days, though, I
felt much more in harmony with my surroundings, shed some of my anxiety, and was
able to enjoy one of my favorite activities: getting lost in a good novel at the beach (in
this case, the wonderful _All the Light We Cannot See,_ by Th. Doerr). Other activities
(beyond the luxury of quality time with Ben and Sammi): a morning yoga class on the
beach, which I dedicated (per the teacher's suggestion) to my pursuit of wellness. Was
unable to do bridge and a few other poses because my surgeries wreaked havoc on my
abdominal muscles, and I did get a bit winded (made sure to be gentle w/myself and not
give myself a hard time about my underwhelming yoga 'performance') but did feel sore
the next day, which I was glad for; a few nice meals out w/Ben (super fresh, delicious
sashimi at the Westlake Fish House in Montauk; excellent Mexican [roast LI duck in
pomegranate/apricot sauce] at Coche + killer Mezcal drinks -- Ben offered me a taste) +
an equally yummy meal  we cooked once Sammi arrived (linguine in pesto w/fresh
scallops bought at Stuart's, a longstanding fish+++ store in E. Hampton); E. Hampton
farmers market (hideously overpriced and no better than our local ones); a quick coffee
and catch up with a dear grade school friend of 50-ish (??) years, Eva, who lives in Sag
Harbor year-round. We only had time to scratch the surface but it was so heartwarming
to reconnect. Her stepson is a first-year student at Penn State, so hopefully we'll be able
to visit again in State College when she's next there. We have such a long history and so
many shared memories -- plus an 'older and wiser' perspective on some of the path
we've travelled too.
We abbreviated our stay by 1.5 days to avoid the approaching hurricane, but
nevertheless had a hellacious drive back to NY Saturday night -- pounding rain, godawful
traffic. Foodies that the three of us are, though, we nevertheless made a 20 minute+
detour to enjoy pizza at a 'real deal' LI pizza parlor, Umberto's in Sayville, which Ben and
Sammi had discovered on a previous trip to the Island. Amazingly good.

I spent two nights in the city at my mother's once we got off the Island. Ben was kind
enough to drive me out of the city so I could avoid the city traffic, Holland tunnel, and
confusing web of highways around Newark, then I drove the remaining 3++ hours back
home. I found it tiring.

recommended. It will be a therapy group. A youngish guy (blond hair, wire rimmed
glasses, kind of 'crunchy granola' looking) tells me about it -- he may even be a member,
but he quickly drops out of the dream. The therapist (and group leader) is a  fairly stylish
youngish woman with dark hair; she seems a bit harried getting ready for the group but
warmly shakes my hand. Once in the room with the other members, she puts her cheek
against mine as a kind of welcome. When I either tell her or indicate otherwise that I
don't find that gesture appropriate in a group therapy setting, she kind of snorts and
says: ""Well, you want to have your cake and eat it too!"" The group members are
numerous and all women. On first glance I realize that I know many of them. One is a
local acquaintance/friend, Jean N., who greets me very warmly in front of everyone
(thereby revealing that she knows me). Another women, Lynn S., is a former staff
assistant in the Dean's office who (in reality) passed away two years ago at age 60 - I
don't know how. Another woman [in the dream, not in reality] is someone I know from
Holocaust teaching/research circles. Because there are so many women in the group,
this last woman is sitting at a desk in a secondary ring of chairs/desks around the first
one. This clues me into the fact that the set up bears some resemblance to a
classroom/seminar room.  What I can fathom from this dream is that a group of close
women friends may represent *one* (but not the only...) prominent form of sociability for
                       784 / 1.901
me now that I've retired, replacing - or overlapping - my school/teaching networks. The
presence of a staff colleague who died at around my age (as well as a Holocaust
researcher?) seems obvious in its significance. I'm really not sure what to make of the
rest. But I'm sure my therapist will have some ideas on Friday!
The fall semester started yesterday. It feels strange not to be teaching. I miss the energy
of the first day of classes, the adrenaline rush. I miss interacting with students (ie
undergraduates as I am still working with several graduate students). I don't miss the
admin stuff though, to be honest, especially in this challenging environment. A fear:
becoming irrelevant, marginal, de trop, lacking opportunities to be helpful.
The holidays are almost here.  I'll celebrate my *third* new year since my diagnosis.  My
mother is, per tradition, travelling here from NY and I look forward to cooking with her
and enjoying the holiday.

213,"A brief update as I'm wiped out from yesterday's chemo session. Everything went
smoothly but it's a long day -- 9:30 a.m.-5 p.m.! -- requiring much physical/mental
wherewithal. I always bring lots of reading, projects etc. but usually just wind up dozing,
writing to friends etc. It seems to be hard for me to concentrate on much else, and of
course I'm conscious of the presence of other patients too, although curtains provide
some privacy. A favorite nurse, Brianne, kept me covered in warm blankets, well-stocked
with water and snacks, and generally very well cared for. My kind neighbor, Janis, woke
up earlier than she usually does to drive me to Scenery Park and my steadfast friend,
Jackie, picked me up and treated me to -- wait for it! -- a milkshake at Meyer's Dairy (a
chocolate marshmallow malted milkshake, to be precise).
The chemo continues to batter my red and white blood cells; my hemoglobin production
is even lower than two weeks ago. And that makes me tired. On the (much) better news
front, though, my CA125 level dropped from the higher than considered normal 51
earlier this month to 29 U/ml two days ago! This is a significant drop, which suggests the
treatment is working (I say 'suggests' because this marker is not a hard and faster
indicator -- another uncertainty -- although for me it's been a pretty reliable one). So I'm
                       789 / 1.901
back into a range considered normal (<38 U/ml), although my normal is more like 11-13.
Hopefully next month I will see the indicator drop even further. I've mentioned before the
stress of feeling like I'm living/dying by a number, the feeling of 'retraumatization' every
time I see an increase and, conversely, the tears of relief and gratitude I cry (my body
literally shakes) every time I see a decrease.
Current plan: one more round of chemo (under current regimen) in two weeks. Then
scan (abdomen/pelvis/lungs). Then (re)assessment, with my oncs, of where things stand
and what future treatment may entail. At that point, I also want to get a 'bigger picture'
sense of what my long(er) term treatment may be going forward. Dr. Beavis spoke of
several 'back pocket' options. I will keep my eyes on emerging clinical trials. Perhaps
another parp inhibitor is in store, perhaps further rounds of the current regimen if it
continues to be effective. 
Blood pressure good, platelet production seems to have increased since last time - also
good. V. tired today, as mentioned, but hope to begin rebounding a bit tomorrow. I made
it to the farmers market and to my favorite drive through café for an iced latte, but
envision an afternoon at least partly on the couch in my 'chemo den'/sunroom, beating
the heat, tucking into _The Handmaid's Tale_ (which somehow I have never read).
As expected, I feel 'unmoored' not being on campus, in the classroom, in my office, with
my faculty and staff colleagues, and students -- some of my 'happy places.' I knew that
low-grade depression was going to hit me as I experienced this loss (props to Lexapro).
I'm still working through it as I continue to transition to a schedule (even if it's a non-
schedule) that makes sense for me and motivates me. On the other hand, I am
categorically certain that I'd be unable to handle the rigors of my
teaching/administering/researching schedule right now, and am grateful to be able to
avail myself of the resources necessary for me to focus primarily on wellness.

Much gratitude to the friends/family who checked in with me yesterday,
before/during/after chemo, via text, email, grocery shopping, rides etc. The uplift is very
beneficial to me on a day when I need all the strength and courage I can muster. Thank
you: Ben, Mom, Ethan, Eve, Maria, Jackie, Janis, Monique, Scott, Helen, Clare, Michael

214,">This is a *reprint* from my entries for Rosh Hashanah 5070 and 5071. Interesting for
me to look back on them now. I will post again soon about my *third* opportunity to
celebrate the new year since my diagnosis. Grateful:
 
September 18, 2020 - Happy birthday to the world
Journal Entry by Willa Silverman — September 18, 2020
This is the second New Year I've been able to welcome in since my ""alive day"" last May. 
So -- and because I'm a bit rushed right now getting ready for the holiday -- I will, for the
first time, post a 'reprint' from last 29 September. So much has changed since then.
COVID has upended our lives - irrevocably? My mother and I have enjoyed many a Rosh
Hashanah here together: she comes up to State College, we cook up a storm, go to
services followed by a nice lunch, then tashlich, marked by a pleasant stroll in Walnut
Creek Park with other congregants. This year I'm solo -- I'm sad to be without my family,
but I'm ok. And traditions must continue! Last year, as I recall, I felt very worn out (I was
                       792 / 1.901
undergoing my first course of chemo) but still managed to whip up a brisket with
pomegranate sauce. This year I'm feeling stronger -- undergoing ""second line"" treatment
for a recurrence, but I seem to be responding quite well. No hair loss, better energy,
working full time. I had chemo yesterday but still had ample energy to make chicken
soup, honey cakes and a plum compote w/vanilla and cardamon. For the rest of the meal
I splurged and ordered a big boxload of goodies from Zabar's -- matzah balls, chopped
liver, herring in cream sauce, noodle pudding, gefilte fish and a round challah (a lovely
fellow congregant also brought me a round challah today - so kind of her).  I think I'll
dress cute, putting on a new skirt I ordered from Anne-Elisabeth in Paris, my favorite
shop for clothes.  At 8 I'll Zoom into services w/my congregation; ditto for tomorrow
morning. And if I have the energy (I often go into a post-chemo crash after two days), I'll
perform tashlich beside one of our pretty local streams.  I hope I can make it.
I am fine. And I received the good news this morning that my CA125 level has dropped
two more points, to 17 from 19 - still trending in a good direction. I think I'll have a glass
of wine to celebrate the birthday of the world. Let's hope for a better 5781 than the year
before. We need it.
Blessings to all.
Last year's post:
Today is the birthday of the world, Jewish tradition teaches, a time of renewal and hope
for the year ahead. We've fully entered the month of elul, which coincides with early
autumn, and the ""Days of Awe:"" Rosh Hashanah, on which our fate for the new year is
written, and Yom Kippur, on which it is is sealed. Our lives are depicted as being in the
balance during these days before the 'gates close:' ""who shall live to a ripe old age and
who shall lie dying on a bed of pain?"" It's an existential state; we're truly 'on the narrow
bridge.' We beat our chests as we catalog the sins that we've been guilty of the past
year. Yet we are told that teshuvah (repentence or return), tefillah (prayer) and tzedakah
(charity) can temper the harshness of God's decree.
Having had to confront my own mortality over the past few months, the spiritual side of
my journey has come into fuller relief, including during the holidays. I'll welcome the
opportunity at dinner tonight, while blessing a round challah, symbol of the cycle of life,
and later at services, to tap into feelings of hopefulness, renewal, and immanence. To
Emily Dickinson, hope is ""the thing with feathers-/That perches in the soul-"" that can be
heard in ""the chillest land-/And on the strangest Sea-"" I've indeed felt glimmers of hope
in the 'chillest land' and 'strangest Sea' where I've found myself struggling over the past
few months. As for my fate, it surely lies somewhere at the intersection of the designs of
some nasty, aggressive, microscopic cancer cells, the skills of my medical team, and my
own fighting spirit. 
                       793 / 1.901
I am spiritual, yet agnostic. I apologize if this offends any believers who may be reading
this. But I do firmly believe in the manifestation of 'godly' qualities in people, animals,
and nature, whether it be loving kindness, graciousness, mercifulness, or compassion. I
have seen these attributes displayed time and time again since my diagnosis, whether
through friends coming to spend time with me, text or call me, send me thoughtful gifts,
volunteer to do errands for me, cook for me, drive me to Baltimore, or just 'hold space'
for me. It is quite wondrous. 
It is a wonderful holiday this year because my mother and Ben are here. My mother and I
have been cooking up a storm; I'm not quite sure how I managed to pull it off as at the
beginning of the week I was completely wiped out from chemo, but I was searing brisket
and frying onions in pomegranate molasses early this morning. I was hoping that Ben
might take some interest in the holiday cooking (he certainly does in the eating), as I'm
not sure who will continue the culinary traditions after my mother and me.",5,sadness,0.44086936,0.0059960405,0.0026752532,0.01434879,0.41946772,0.07955881,0.44086936,0.037084013
215,"794 / 1.901
                       795 / 1.901
I wasn't able to receive chemo yesterday. Both my hemoglobin and platelets had again
decreased in volume/number, not uncommon with this treatment. The  last round of
chemo, two weeks ago, really wiped me out and it took me a full week to recover (I spent
an *entire day* curled up on the couch in my nightgown, devoid of energy and in a
strange mental state as Hurricane Ida wreaked collateral damage outside in the form of
a monsoon-like rain all day). The second week I felt better but still winded on exertion,
even fairly minimal exertion. My heart has to pump faster/harder to ensure adequate
blood flow, and hence sufficient oxygen flow throughout my body. Thankfully, I have a
healthy heart as excess pressure on it can lead to no good, just as a steep decline in
platelets, in the event of a cut or infection, can lead to no good. As I had mentally
prepared myself for chemo, arriving at Dr. Patel's office bright and early w/all my 'gear'
(lunch, novel, masks, cozy PSU hoodie), steeled for an eight-hour day in the infusion
room, I felt frustrated when Dr. Patel's PA told me that the doctor advised waiting
another week to play it safe. I was likely somewhat pissy with Mary Beth (despite my
Rosh Hashanah resolution to be more patient), attempting to extort 'guarantees' from
her that waiting another week would not give those sneaky cancer cells license to swarm
back in. I seemed unable to channel the frustration in a less childish way... :( So next
week it is, likely on Yom Kippur..... which I don't feel great about, although the dramatic
potential of offering prayers of supplication to be sealed in the Book of Life for another
year at the same time as life-preserving/destroying poison is being shot through my
veins has not been lost on me...
 
The holiday, though, was lovely. After spending last year's holiday on my own and
attending services virtually, this year, per tradition, my mother was able to make the trip
from NY on the Megabus, bearing a beautiful round challah (=plenitude, the 'circle' of
the year that is ending) from Breads Bakery. So grateful she was able to spend the
holiday here! We had a lovely time together. Per tradition as well, I spent about four
days cooking , the last two assisted by my mother. My meal featured traditional dishes
with a twist: chicken liver pâté (shallots, Port, butter, heavy cream), semi-sour pickles,
chicken soup w/matzah balls (the latter containing ginger, nutmeg, paprika, fresh
parsley, onions and schmaltz), brisket in pomegranate sauce, noodle kugel w/apples and
raisins, tzimmes, green beans, honey cake w/stone fruit compote (peaches and plums,
lemon peel) for dessert, an excellent red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape). I love table décor and
enjoy setting an eye-catching table.  I invited my neighbors (and fellow congregants),
Ron and Carol Hodes. While we had never socialized in this way, we had a convivial
dinner, the homey food and good wine loosening our tongues and spirits. I am still eating
leftovers.
It is all partly a hommage to my E. European born grandmother Bessie and great-
grandmother (bubbie) Bella, who also spent days in the kitchen so that we could be
ushered into the overheated kitchen on holidays with indescribably delicious scents (I'm
                       796 / 1.901
remembering 'sweet' and 'schmaltz' -- chicken fat, which was their stealth ingredient).
Every dish had been cooking, it seemed, for hours if not days -- the chicken soup was a
deep yellow (and yes, redolent with schmaltz) while the tin foil that had covered 
roasting pans was now coated with a layer of dark caramelized something. My
grandmother lived in a five floor brownstone on E. 94th st. (between Fifth and Madison)
that featured a *dumbwaiter* for hoisting food from the kitchen to the large dining room
above, whose sideboard groaned with delicious desserts (my favorites were chocolate
covered orange peels and a gâteau St. Honoré with cream puffs) from William Greenberg
bakery or Madison Avenue - oh, and a homemade teiglach, small hard dough balls bound
together with honey in a pyramid, and studded with dried fruits and nuts. Aside from the
traditional Ashkenazi holiday dishes, my grandmother's table also boasted a roast beef
and ...spaghetti and meat balls.
This year Ben and a few friends ordered RH dinner from a Montreal-style place in
Brooklyn, Mile End (Ben and I actually went on a Jewish foods walking tour of this
neighborhood), making me optimistic that he will carry on the traditions in some way.
I've begun writing down all the recipes for him in a lovely blank leather-bound book
gifted me by my grad students. My recipe for ""Mom's Chicken Soup"" is five pages,
including all my tips!
It was heartening, on Monday evening and Tuesday, to return to the synagogue
sanctuary for the first time in at least two (?) years and to greet friends/congregants.
While - to be candid - most of the prayers do not resonate with me, the meaning of the
holiday -- hope to be 'renewed' for another year and  forgiven for 'sins' against God and
other people (I was focusing on impatience, lack of compassion at times, and lack of
sufficient care towards my body) -- is not inconsequential for me.
The following always stick with me, though, and have become mantras:
{Something like}: ""May you walk with good companions."" As I've stated before, I am
very blessed to ""walk with good companions"" and I wish the same for everyone I know
and care about.
Also: [something like] ""With hope in our hearts and eternity in our souls."" 
I have read a lot about this verse (from Ecclesiastes but must also exist in the Torah in
some form too) and about various translations of the word 'olam' (as darkness but also
eternity), but I can only offer what it means to me at this point in time: not a hope for
eternal life (which, if it means a hope for an afterlife, I do not believe in) but simply some
sense of transcendence -- that there is some dimension to life that is not immediately
visible or perceptible to us, but that is *there.* This is the part that I am hopeful endures,
including in memory. I'm probably not explaining this well, but out of the entire service it
is the verse that makes me feel calm and at peace.
                       797 / 1.901
I also read a poem that resonated with me before dinner on erev RH. While I'm a bit
embarrassed to admit that it's by a seeming self-help guru (with a Jewish slant), Dawna
Markova, it seems nevertheless to describe my current path:
I will not die an unlived life,
I will not live in fear
Of falling or catching fire.
 
I choose to inhabit my days
To allow my living to open me,
To make me less afraid,
more accessible,
To loosen my heart
Until it becomes a wing,
A torch, a promise.
 
I choose to risk my significance: to live
So that which came to me as seed
Goes to the next as blossom
And that which came to me as blossom
Goes on as fruit.

Rhonda stopped treatment three months ago and her cancer has progressed, making
her day to day activities more difficult. Rhonda is a 'teal sister' whom I've never met
except virtually, but who is also treated for ovarian cancer at Hopkins. Rhonda is the
                       798 / 1.901
fellow survivor who gifted me the beautiful pendant I am wearing right now, with the
cancer ribbon and the Hebrew for ""be strong and of good courage"" inscribed on it; I told
her I will 'pay it forward' when/if the time comes by gifting the pendant to another
survivor. Rhonda is moving forward without fear of the unknown; palliative and hospice
care can be instrumental shorter- or longer-term methods for facilitating a beautiful end
of life and a 'good death.' Rhonda inspires me to keep eternity in my soul [and heart and
mind].

I have been binging documentaries (my favorite film genre) about highly creative,
complex, and often dark people (who happen to all be men, in this section of my binge). I
am enthralled by what motivates them, their creative process, their lives, their struggles.
Hence: _Roadrunner_ (excellent doc about Anthony Bourdain); Scorsese's two-part doc,
_George Harrison: Living in the Material World_ (the 'quiet Beatle' has always been my
favorite - a brilliant, deeply spiritual musician); _Bitchin:' The Sound and Fury of Rick
James_ (I danced my ass off to his music in college, but didn't realize how rich his legacy
was -- from the ghetto in Buffalo to the Toronto music scene in the 1960s with Neil
Young, to anti-war protestor and 'draft dodger' during the Vietnam War, to Motown to a
sad demise; _Street Songs_ is a brilliant album); _The Bee Gees: How Can you Mend a
Broken Heart_ (HBO) - say what you will, the Gibb brothers were/are (Barry) major
talents (and I'll readily admit that _Saturday Night Fever_ is a prime 'soundtrack of your
life' album for me).
Also trying to catch up on classics that I never got around to reading, currently _The
Handmaid's Tale."" Very OMG in the current context but Margaret Atwood not my favorite
contemporary author. looking forward to the new Colson Whitehead, coming out soon.

217,"A health update first: as you may know from recent posts, I was unable to receive my
treatment last week because my hemoglobin and white blood cell/platelet counts were
too low. I was disappointed and probably did not handle that feeling as well as I could
have but I got with the program relatively quickly. After all, delays in chemo are not
uncommon given the havoc the toxins can wreak on one's system. 
Fortunately, the week's wait was helpful. Although I had to get up early to have my blood
tested before heading off to Yom Kippur morning services -- no fasting for me this year --
the results were, on the whole, encouraging. Both my hemoglobin and platelet counts
had improved, and my magnesium count - another source of some concern - had also
shown improvement. I was too nervous to look at my CA125 number until the following
day, after a wretched, anxious sleep and right before leaving earlier than I'm used to for
chemo (thank you to my stalwart, kind neighbor Janis for driving me there), but that too
is trending in a better direction, decreasing from about 29 last time to about 22 this
time, after a 51 to 29 decrease between the previous two treatments! All of this made
me feel encouraged, to say the least, and Dr. Patel's PA (to whom I apologized for being
snippy the previous week -- this was the Day of Atonement after all) ok'd me for
treatment. 
Somehow treatment day -- 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. -- passes. I slept a bit. Texted friends. Ate
lunch (delicious yogurt my friend David made for me, which I mixed with local honey,
slivered almonds and golden raisins). My very kind, highly efficient nurse, Brianne, talked
about her growing up in a heavily Jewish area in New Jersey, so she knows from chicken
matzah ball soup, bagels and lox, and the high holidays -- a refreshing change in a
community where the HHs usually go completely under the radar. I promised to give her
a copy of my soup/matzah ball recipe, the one I wrote out for Ben with all my tips. My
dear friend Maria picked me up, bearing the turkey chili I had asked her to pick up for me
from Wegman's, and knew to whisk me right to Meyer's dairy for the now customary post-
chemo ice cream treat (Otto's root beer float w/coconut chip ice cream for me, a quart of
ice cream for her to take home). We sat at a picnic table in the sun, catching up and
gabbing, before Maria's ice cream showed some signs of melting. When I got home I was
so tired I crashed on the cozy couch in my sun room/'chemo den,' then spent a relaxing
evening resting and watching t.v.
Today I didn't get out of bed until close to 11, rallied for breakfast, then had to lie down
again. Somehow by 2 p.m. I rallied again, showered, then took a long drive (as I'm wont
to do...) along country backroads, discovering some new ones that will keep me sourced
with delicious brown eggs and freshly made apple cider (unpasteurized, hope that's ok
                       815 / 1.901
for my fragile immune system but it looked so tasty... maybe if I boil it and drink it hot
spiced). Stopped at 'my' antiques store, The Beaten Path; if anything can rouse me, it's
antiquing! Bought a cute blingy baroque-ish trinket holder for $3; a set of five Art Deco
apéritif glasses (great design); and - wait for it - ten brass (?) napkin holders in the shape
of turkeys! These will complement my burgeoning collection of 'Thanksgiviana' - all
bought at antiques stores: vintage Thanksgiving postcards, a cool 1950s set of nesting
(like Russian dolls) turkeys, etc. Now just need to figure out the Thanksgiving plans for
this year...
I hope to feel well enough to have dinner at friends' house tomorrow night to celebrate a
book publication but will see how I feel tomorrow when I wake up. Don't want to overdo
it.
In two weeks I will have a scan (pelvis/abdomen/chest) -- by which point I will be in full-
throttle 'scanxiety' over what it might reveal (or not???) - followed by an appointment
with Dr. Patel the following week to consult about the treatment plan (presumably,
hopefully in consultation w/Dr. Beavis; I will, in fact, insist on it). At this point, I will want
to ask questions about the longer term: how much treatment can my body safely
absorb? At what point will we exhaust treatment options? It is possible -- as a next
appointment was already scheduled for three weeks from now-- that since my current
treatment is working effectively, I will continue with it for a while, or until it is not longer
working.  I need to discuss options, plans. So.much.uncertainty.
Happy, though, to have a three-week break from chemo.
Yom Kippur came and went this past week (Wednesday evening and Thursday). My kind
neighbors and fellow congregants, Carol and Ron, reciprocated my erev Rosh Hasahanah
invite by having me over for erev Yom Kippur dinner - more chicken soup and brisket
was consumed! During services, again, I let my mind wander, making a mental checklist
of 'sins' or infractions I may have committed (more than a few, according to the lists we
recited) and thinking about how I could do better. I could not help but feel a big ""UGH""
around one of the holiday's central questions: who will be sealed for another year of life,
who shall not, and by what means might literal or figurative 'death' occur (not just ""who
by fire"" but also ""who will wander...who will suffer""). This brought to mind the Leonard
Cohen song, ""Who by Fire:""
And who by fire, who by water,
who in the sunshine, who in the night time,
who by high ordeal, who by common trial,
who in your merry merry month of may,
who by very slow decay,
and who shall I say is calling?
And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate,
                       816 / 1.901
who in these realms of love, who by something blunt,
and who by avalanche, who by powder,
who for his greed, who for his hunger,
and who shall I say is calling?
And who by brave assent, who by accident,
who in solitude, who in this mirror,
who by his lady's command, who by his own hand,
who in mortal chains, who in power,
and who shall I say is calling?
As I think I've written before -- and I sincerely hope not to offend the religious convictions
of those more strictly observant than I am -- I don't believe that my fate is ""in God's
hands"" but will depend, rather, on the wiles of sneaky cancer cells and the ability of my
medical team to beat them back for as long as possible. My ""positive attitude"" will not
change anything physiologically, as far as I know, but will help me navigate this difficult
journey in terms of my emotions, mental state etc. (w/a shout out to Lexapro and my
therapist). In this regard, the loving support of my family and friends -- especially those
of you dear ones who have been ""ride or die"" since the very beginning -- wingpeople
extraordinaires -- has been a constant uplifting balm. I am so grateful.
So I found myself sitting in the sanctuary, drawn to certain passages, sound bites and
prayers (Psalm 27 is one that calms me), thinking about the essence of the holiday being
about love on some level, and simply hoping (wishing? praying?) to be here again next
year. I so very much want to be.
I livestreamed the Neilah service on Thursday at 7 p.m. - the climax of the holiday when
""the doors of the ark are closing"" and we are sending up the final supplications for the
year ahead, only to be awoken to the urgent matter at hand, ie living, by the blasts of
the shofar. I was really connecting with the service when.... it suddenly cut off (I don't
believe it was a connectivity issue), which was frustrating but oh well. I treated myself to
a Trader Joe's bagel with smoked salmon, an adequate reminder of the delectable spread
we used to have at our synagogue's post-Yom Kippur 'break the fast' (cancelled this year
out of COVID precautions).
Thank you to everyone who texted, sent cards, emailed etc. before/during/after
yesterday's chemo. It makes me feel surrounded by love and caring!

I will appreciate any and all good thoughts, healing energy etc. you care to send my way
tomorrow when my abdomen, pelvis and chest are scanned beginning at 9 a.m. I
imagine that the scan will be with contrast, which means no breakfast and drinking a lot
of yucky stuff before the scan. It takes a few days for the radiologists here to produce a
report on the scan, and I'll have a disc made so I can send it to Dr. Beavis as well for the
Hopkins' radiologists to read. My inclination is not to look at the report myself before I
can discuss it with the doctors. I can't always parse the technical language, which results
in confusion and anxiety for me, and don't need any excuse to *avoid* knowing the
results for as long as possible. Ignorance = bliss?
The scanning experience tends to be retraumatizing for me. I can picture the alarmed
expressions on the doctors' faces when my (plentiful) cancer first showed up on a scan in
the ER in March or April 2019, and then again a few months ago, also in the ER. I am
anxious about the discrepancy between my still well-put together exterior (everyone
seems to think I look good and I do take some comfort from that fact) and the cellular
havoc that may be occurring underneath/inside it. I hope the cancer hasn't metastasized
further, endangering other organs; well, I'll find out soon enough. I feel a little bit
bloated, but perhaps that's from the butter pecan ice cream cone I indulged in today!
A very wise, compassionate and kind friend helped me get out of a funk last week. I had
sort of worried myself into a corner, trying to figure out if I should devote my energies to
preparing to die (eg downsizing, fine-tuning my will, general putting my affairs in order
etc.) or continuing to live (eg working on the article that's currently engrossing me;
sticking to my current routines etc.); the latter option is of course what my oncologists
have been promoting all along. My friend pointed out that, in some sense, this is the
existential dilemma we all face (ie how to confront the fact that we are mortal and how
to live meaningfully with this fact in mind) but that this dilemma may well seem more
salient in my case because of a potentially (likely?) shorter lifespan. I noted (and she did
too) that I often set up false dichotomies for myself, falling prey to 'either/or' thinking
rather than what she called 'and/and' thinking: giving away about six large boxes of
Ben's baby clothes and toys the other day, for example, does serve the 'downsizing' goal
but also helps create a less cluttered, less encumbered environment for myself that is a
healthier space in which for me to thrive/focus on living. I'm not sure this makes sense. It
may seem very obvious. In any event, I am grateful to my friend for helping me get
'unstuck' (during an always fun jaunt to an antiques store) and also helping me figure
out how I want to focus my energies: quality time with loved ones and some research
projects are two pleasurable/meaningful activities that come to mind immediately.
Although I definitely hope to get to Paris sooner rather than later, I am not particularly
invested in changing my routines dramatically at this point or in completing any sort of
'bucket list.' A day that is wonderfully 'normal' in its routines can seem like a gift these
days. We'll see if that changes over the next stretch, post-scan and discussions with my
                       820 / 1.901
oncologists.
Meanwhile, life continues. The weather has been glorious. Today a dear friend and I
enjoyed lunch outdoors at the arboretum (a bit comically, our peaceful moment was
interrupted by earsplitting construction noise, perhaps in view of a new parking
garage?). There has also been a pleasant visit (also outdoors in the sun) from another
wise friend, an outing to see Los Lobos in concert at the State Theatre (yay to evening
entertainment resuming!), another lunch outdoors at Café Lemont, a friend's birthday
party, and a dinner party with friends (likely a prelude to another antiquing trip this
Saturday), a long drive in the country, and much work on an article. I am so grateful to
know that I will get to see the fall foliage this year; this ""season of mists and mellow
fruitfulness"" is my favorite.
A p.s. for State College peeps: if anyone reading this works with a housecleaner they
might 'lend' me for occasional or regular visits please let me know. I let go my longtime
housecleaner (whom I was close to) because she wouldn't get vaccinated, and I'm afraid
that ship has sailed now. I started to work with someone else who was very good, but
she found a permanent job of a different type. I am last on a very long waiting list with a
cleaning service. Unfortunately, I don't have the physical wherewithal to do deep
cleaning right now and I really need some help. So please share any bright ideas you
may have!

I greatly appreciate all the shows of concern while I await the results of my scan.
Unfortunately but not unexpectedly really, my scan revealed progression of my cancer. I
received that news from Dr. Beavis via email as I was driving (fortunately, to my
therapist's) and my heart started racing, although the phrase ""many options"" reversed
that thumping a bit. Tumors in my pelvic/abdominal area have increased in size (by mm)
and several lymph nodes in the abdomen and chest area (and maybe shoulder?) have
enlarged. In better news, there is no visible cancer in my lungs nor in my liver. Dr.
Beavis, with whom I videoconferenced for about an hour yesterday, explained, very
clearly, how and why my CA125 number could have decreased while my cancer
progressed (it has to do with the inability of a protein on the surface of cells to 'express'
itself as the cells undergo mutations -- at least that's what I understood given  my limited
amount of scientific literacy). It is also possible to look well (as I believe I do) while
cancer cells wreak havoc below the surface.  I've got to imagine, though, that a 'put
together' appearance is helpful on some level, as it tends to make me feel more
'collected.'
In her words, my cancer is ""not going away"" -- something I also understood intuitively
but understand in a more visceral way now. At the same time, I think she said something
about my having ""many years."" However, I also 'did the math,' with the knowledge that
successive treatments are successful for progressively shorter and shorter amounts of
time -- and the number of treatment options is limited (although many trials are ongoing,
including one involving immunotherapy that may be starting soon). On the other hand,
Dr. Beavis mentioned a current patient who is doing very well on Taxol after a *year.*
Further, she added, ovarian cancer is notoriously ""unpredictable.""
So...much...uncertainty.
Dr. Beavis (who had conferred with Dr. Patel) presented me with three treatment
options: 1)weekly Taxol (this is one of the drugs with which  I was treated initially),
administered here. Average effectiveness rate in maintaining cancer at current level or
shrinking it: 30-35%. I am now 'platinum resistant' so drugs like cisplatin will no longer
work for me.
2)Taxol (infusion) + Fostamatinib (a type of inhibitor in pill form), administered as part of
a clinical trial conducted by Hopkins. What I gathered is that this would involve weekly
trips to Hopkins for the first month or so; after that, Dr. Patel could administer the Taxol
here while I would be supplied with the pills to take. As this is a clinical trial, there is no
data on effectiveness; it would be a leap of faith. The treatment would not make me any
*worse* off than treatment 1, and might yield a better result. The complicating issue
relates to logistics, travel to/from Baltimore, especially when fatigued etc.
3)Taxol + Avastin (potential success rate in containing or reducing cancer = 50%). There
                       828 / 1.901
is a low (4-5%) risk of a very bad side effect with Avastin: an unfixable bowel perforation.
If that happens, per Dr. Beavis, it can be ""life threatening."" She has seen such a case
before and it was basically ""game over."" I think we've all decided that this option should
be 'back pocketed' until the number of acceptable treatment options becomes slimmer.
I had a productive meeting with Dr. Patel this morning as well. He went over the scan
results, examined me, and discussed the options. By the time I saw him, I had already
determined that I was leaning towards the trial. I can make the logistics work (one option
would be to base myself in NY during the period of weekly commutes to Baltimore).
Given this, I want to go for the potentially more hopeful option. Tomorrow I will speak by
phone with a Hopkins nurse associated with the trial who will answer all my questions.
My main concern is that the trial might end before I have to a chance to (potentially)
benefit from it (although no one has said for sure that this might be the case); it's been
running for two years already and once a certain number of patients (subjects?) are
enrolled, the trial may end. However, I was sent the consent form today and Dr. Beavis
presented this trial as a viable option, so I'm crossing my fingers that it will be. She left
the choice between options 1) and 2) up to me. Dr. Patel recommends the trial.
On Taxol, I will lose my hair again (time for a new wig and more cute hats/caps), my
neuropathy will probably worsen (perhaps my fingers will be affected, which would be a
drag), and I'll be fatigued (the fatigue the first time around was acute, but maybe it
won't be as bad this time).
Please disabuse yourselves of the idea that my cancer may go into permanent remission
or even 'be cured.' It won't (how long does Willa have left -- a new parlor game?).
Ovarian cancer in Dr. Beavis' words is ""insidious."" Did you know that cancer cells can
generate new blood vessels to feed off?? I didn't. If that isn't insidious I don't know what
is.
Please don't feel sorry for me, as I don't feel sorry for myself. Well, maybe on occasion I
have moments of nearly unbearable FOMO. But they are matched by swells of immense
gratitude, and a weird yet fleeting *liberating* feeling after speaking with Dr. Beavis and
realizing that I'll have time to organize and orchestrate this next chapter, in all respects.
And I look forward to more fun, creativity, time with loved ones, giggles. At least that's
how I'm feeling today. 
I do feel a need to create a safe, calm, protective bubble around myself. This is why I
may undertake some 'triaging' of thoughts, sights, acquaintances etc. that are inimical in
relation to this goal.
I am incredibly grateful for my medical team. And for my State College support team,
and wonderful friends and family near and far. I told Dr. Beavis that I always feel better
after speaking with her. She, in turn, told me that she always feels better after speaking
                       829 / 1.901
with *me.* Amazing!
This post may be rather disjointed, reflecting my state right now. My mind has been
racing and it's hard to turn it off. I have a lot to figure out. Was hoping to spend the
weekend at my brother and family's country home in the Catskills but will now take a
rain check (perhaps literally as a rainy weekend is in store, which may thwart my fall
foliage oohing and aahing ambitions) for a hopefully not far removed weekend. 
So I'm on the 'narrow bridge' again. And the most important thing, per Rabbi Nachman of
Breslau, is *not to give in to one's despair.*",2,fear,0.5802916,0.013544853,0.0024255475,0.5802916,0.010023349,0.09157142,0.096967585,0.20517558
220,"Here's as much of an update as I can muster (or muddle through) at present:
1)I've decided to opt for the clinical trial at Hopkins, which is the most *potentially*
promising option, although it's also entirely possible that I'll see no benefits from the
treatment. I'm banking on 30-35% odds, from what I've been told.
2)*If* Aetna authorizes my claim, next Thursday I will be at Hopkins for a)blood work (I
think?); b)a physical with Dr. Beavis; c)and an EKG (?). This physical screening is a
prelude to treatment starting the following week. While the nurse working with patients
enrolled in the trial conveyed to me that my claim was 'pending,' when I called Aetna
(think phone trees, recordings, long stretches of Muzak etc.), I was told that they had no
record of a claim being filed on my behalf. It turns out that Dr. Beavis needs/needed to
submit her signed notes on my case to Aetna. I very much hope she did so today. That
will leave a mere few days for Aetna to review my claim. If I don't receive authorization
by Wednesday, everything will have to be pushed back a week, meaning I will have gone
without treatment for seven weeks, a stressful prospect (and I have a feeling those
sneaky cancer cells draw some hidden power from my stress). I have no reason at this
point to think Aetna will not authorize my claim (the part not covered by Hopkins in the
context of a clinical trial). I just hope it happens soon.
3)*If* Aetna authorizes my claim, I will start treatment the following week, the 27th/28th.
On the 27th I will have a needle biopsy of one of my tumors, as I agreed to participate in
                       832 / 1.901
a second study in which tumors are being studied to assess which treatments are most
or least effective for specific tumors. Someone must be with me to accompany me after
the biopsy. On the 28th I will have treatment. I have no idea what I'll feel like afterwards,
what side effects may hit me etc. One uncertainty among many.
4)I spent about an hour on the phone with a lovely sounding nurse, Justin, who will be my
'nurse coordinator' for the duration of the trial. He (re)convinced me that the nurses at
Hopkins are gems. I spent another hour on the phone with another nurse who set up my
biopsy, did some intake, and answered my questions. And I spent more time on the
phone with the housing coordinator at Hopkins, who provided info about longer-term
housing options. Joanne's affect was nurturing and caring (but also no-nonsense) and we
'hit it off' as well as one can with a stranger during a short phone call. We had both
received the COVID booster the day before and were suffering through flu-like symptoms
(awful in my case, but that's another story). She made me *promise* her that I would
have a caregiver with me during each of my trips to Hopkins. She also said I sounded
stressed (on point there) and made me promise her that I'd lie on the couch and relax
with a cup of tea once i got off the phone with her.
5)PA, MD or NY? Logistics, logistics. I'm still muddling through where to base myself
during the month when I'll be making weekly trips to Hopkins (after that it will be
monthly trips). Per one of my personal mantras: ""Everything in life is a tradeoff,"" in this
case  between comfort and convenience. I've more or less ruled out State College,
except for the next two weeks, because it's a four-hour drive from Baltimore, the
weather may start to turn rough next month (especially through those last miles of
mountain passes), and I can't predict how I'll feel/if I'll feel up to driving after treatment.
While Baltimore makes a lot of sense in terms of convenience (and a few people whose
opinions I trust are lobbying for that option), I'm leaning towards NY and my network of
beloved family and friends there. I have an image of myself alone in a hotel room in
Baltimore, should I spend the month there, sort of withering emotionally because cut off
from 'my people.' I really don't do well in that type of situation (although a few kindly
souls might decide to come visit me). In any event, every week I will need most likely
need to spend one night in Baltimore because of the way the appointments will be set
up. If it happens in any given week that I simply feel too tired to return to NY, I can
always stay overnight at my trusted Residence Inn John Hopkins Medical Center, where I
have stayed many times. Hopkins has some longer-term housing options for people
receiving ongoing care at Hopkins, but there are some restrictions that I may not meet.
Also, I had wanted to be in NY in Nov. for a few compelling reasons: my friend Mitchel's
visit from France; my friend Laurent's photography show opening; two exhibits at the
Jewish Museum, seeing other friends and family members. I have no idea how energetic
-- or not -- I'll feel, but ideally I'd like to try to be available for these occasions. On the
other hand, I am hoping to attend a family bar-mitzvah in Baltimore on Nov. 18th..
                       833 / 1.901
Isn't this simply thrilling?!? I'd much rather be sitting poolside on an an island drinking a
cocktail, enjoying a café crême in Paris (or doing just about anything else) but here we
are... and I will feel *very* grateful for the insurance hurdle to be cleared and for
treatment at Hopkins to start.
So here's my pitch: *if* I am indeed based in NY and in weekly treatment at Hopkins in
November, would any of my NY pals or fam be up to making a trip (likely involving an
overnight, *maybe* even two but more likely one -- a Th/Fr, a W/Th, or a W/Th/Fr) with
me? Given that I'll be receiving Taxol (aka the Red Devil) and also given the lovely side
effects I might expect (diarrhea, neuropathy, etc.), I am somewhat wary of making the
trip alone. I am happy to cover all expenses and hopefully there'd be some giggles along
the way. I was very touched today when my ex-brother-in-law (w/whom I had lunch
during his visit with Michael) offered to accompany me to B'more if it meshes with his
schedule (Thursday is apparently a good day for him). I know that many of you might like
to, but have other commitments and of course I understand that (so no need to respond
in that case). I'd be most interested in hearing, instead, from those of you for whom this
might actually be feasible. I know I can count on my mother one week (thank you,
Mom!).
Meanwhile, I am doing ok moodwise, keeping busy, enjoying time with friends, taking
drives, working on an article I feel good about (plus a book review + a book manuscript
evaluation). That's the best medicine for me. Bought a blingy green ring at an antiques
store. Enjoyed a Latin Festival downtown with my friend Clare, Went to an outstanding
concert with my friend Jackie by a choral group I adore, Voces8. Please listen to
""Timshel"" below and understand why I appreciate this song of comfort. Thank you, John,

for the sweets and the magnificent vintage Whitman's chocolate tin adorned with

221,"Greetings from Baltimore.
My 'teal sister' Rhonda Gold, whom I never met but knew only through social media as
an OC survivor treated at Hopkins, died a day or two ago, in her late sixties, after a six or
seven year bout with OC. I've been wearing the pendant Rhonda sent me bearing the
cancer bow, two teal colored stones, and the words ""Chazak ve'ematz"" (""Be strong and
of good courage""), from the Book of Joshua. Someone had given it to her one Rosh
Hashanah and she entrusted it to me, as I hope to entrust it, eventually, to another OC
survivor. I wish I had met her. She seemed like an extraordinary, vibrant woman, like me
most 'afilliative' (to use a word my therapist sometimes uses to describe me). On her
                       836 / 1.901
Facebook page today, a quote from the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi: ""Goodbyes are
only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul
there is no such thing as separation.""
I'm in Baltimore for a few physical screening appointments prior to my first treatment
next week (I hope) as part of a clinical trial at Hopkins. This being said, Hopkins appears
to have been very late submitting the precertification request to my insurance company
so it hasn't been approved yet (frankly, I don't even know if it's even been submitted).
Aetna needs to clear everything by next Wednesday, when I have a biopsy (I agreed to
enroll in a second study that involves studying tumor samples). Aggravation.
Let me apologize off the bat to those whom I might have 'left hanging' as I try to work
out complicated logistics for the next month, when I'll be travelling to Baltimore once a
week for treatment, most likely from New York. My focus has been on getting the first
one or two weeks set up (a complicated endeavor in itself) but I promise to be in touch
asap with those most generous family members and friends who have offered rides,
accompaniment to Baltimore, housing, and meals/errands/miscellaneous. Much as I
treasure my independence, I unfortunately can't make the next month (or more) work
without help, so I am extremely grateful for the generous responses. Thank you.
I also owe some emails and will try to get back to everyone asap!
Plans, plans, plans. Plans will keep me busy this next month. And busy-ness is a bulwark
against anxiety, depression, and worry. Dr. Beavis said: ""I can't give you a cure, but I can
give you a plan."" So I grasp at plans and their myriad components, hopefully. ""These
fragments I have shored against my ruins.""
I am feeling ok, with some slight discomfort in my abdomen/pelvic area and back. I am
very eager to begin treatment before my cancer has any more time to grow/spread, and
equally eager to assess whether treatment is working as soon after that as possible. If
it's not, we're on to the next plan. That *might* be a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan-
Kettering, if they can offer me a potentially (more) effective treatment or trial. Since I
will spend most of November in NY, Dr. Beavis suggested I schedule a consult there,
which I find a great idea. She has already sent a gyn onc surgeon she deems 'terrific' my
information and I hope to contact her asap. I'll see Dr. Beavis tomorrow and she can
advise.
I had such a pleasant drive down here. It's really not arduous at all: perhaps 3.5 hours
driving time. A gorgeous fall day with the foliage colors becoming deeper, more vibrant
and varied the further south I drove. I stopped for lunch at Alvaro's (alvarobread.com), a
'real deal' Italian bakery that has long been my midway point/pit stop between State
College and Baltimore/DC. It's a small place on a corner in the historical downtown area
of Harrisburg (which I think they call 'Uptown?'), casual, full of state government
                       837 / 1.901
employees and locals who appear to be regular customers. A few tables with umbrellas
outside. The 'nonna' holds down the fort in the kitchen, producing the mouth-watering
daily specials; I dug into delicious soft meatballs in sauce with a side of homemade bread
that I dipped in the sauce, then bought stuffed shells and sausage to take with me for
dinner tonight, along with a hefty portion of pastries (a cannoli, an eclair, a mini
sfogliatelle and a few cookies). It is always shocking to see the housing inequities in
Harrisburg (and of course Baltimore, much of it right near the JH Medical Center), block
upon block of dilapidated houses along with lovely renovated Victorians and a glistening
Susquehanna waterfront.
I'm back at my 'home away from home' here in Baltimore: the Marriott Residence Inn
Johns Hopkins Medical Center, where I've stayed many times. Many JHMC patients stay
here and the staff is kindly, the rooms ultra-clean and quiet, the free breakfast copious.
The top floor restaurant with the great view (my friend Sandy, mom, Ethan and Ben will
remember it) apparently did not survive the pandemic, but I ordered a small salad from
the bar downstairs. While I'd prefer not to remember some of my previous post-surgery
or post-procedure visits here, tonight I am feeling strong physically and mentally, ready
to move forward. I continue to be blessed to ""walk with good companions.""
If all goes as planned, I'll drive back to State College tomorrow and can't wait to hug Ben
and Sammi, who will be arriving for the weekend on Friday. I'll return here next Tuesday
for my biopsy Wednesday morning and treatment and other appointments on Thursday.
As promised, I will be in touch asap (certainly once I return to SC) with the kind
friends/family members who have offered me rides to/from Baltimore as well as help 'on
the ground' (I must have a 'caregiver' with me for the biopsy and likely for treatment as
well). Then back to SC for  a few days before driving to New York with my friend Deb, to
stay until.... Thanksgiving? That's the tentative plan, although it's always possible I may
only go so far with the trial if it doesn't prove effective. If I have adverse side effects,
moreover, it is also possible, that we might stop the trial for a week or two and then
restart. So...much...uncertainty. But in the meantime....plans!
Go figure that just as my cancer progresses my social/friend life in SC starts to get
interesting, maybe more interesting than it's been in years as I always felt that my 'real'
friends were elsewhere -- in NY, or Paris, or Boston etc. But the past months and, I
suppose, 2.5 years have brought some wonderful people into my PA life and have helped
solidify existing friendships. Wonder if that's coincidence -- or not (I think not). A jaunt to
Duncansville PA along gorgeous backroads with my 'antiquing posse' was lots of fun last
weekend, as was a visit from and great convo w/Mark, a State College friend who moved
to Cali, as was Thai take-out lunch in a cute park in Lemont w/my friend Maria, as was
dinner with three smart, stylish, kind women friends, Kathryn, Cheryl and Sandy (a Paris
trip was discussed....), as was a long catch-up visit with my friend/colleague Benedicte
(don't have my 'accent-friendly' keyboard with me), who brought me a vintage Witman's
candy box adorned with a Mucha image of Sarah Bernhardt -- which B. had loaded up
                       838 / 1.901
with all sorts of sweet treats (VIchy pastilles and such) from France. Looking forward to
(her) bday lunch w/my friend Helen on Monday. And did I mention lunch outdoors at the
Ale House, in the mellow sunshine, w/ex-bro in law Bruce?
I'm a lucky girl. :)

Just a quick update: I am back in Baltimore to begin treatment this week, if all goes as
planned. My main hopes for the coming weeks are that a)the treatment is effective in
stabilizing or reversing my cancer growth (this will likely only be ascertained in eight
weeks, when I have a scan, provided I do well in the trial>see b] and c]); b)the side
effects of the treatment are not too harsh, debilitating, and potentially irreversible (I'll be
monitored very closely here); and c)related to b]: I can withstand the side effects without
undue delays in my treatment.
I think I'm 'just' anxious. I've never participated in a clinical trial, never had chemo
administered at Hopkins, never done this weekly commuting thing, never had my
treatment become *such* a full-time job, never met any of the staff associated with the
trial etc. The presence, physical or virtual, of 'good companions' (angels?) helps
immensely.
My friend Sandy and I gabbed for 3.5 hours in the car to Baltimore, so the trip went very
quickly. We reminisced about two previous times she drove me to Baltimore, including
our getting lost trying to find a lunch spot in/near Harrisburg and winding up at a very
strange sandwich shop (""Sandwich Man"") on the outskirts of the capital that was pretty
much a dump but that had very attractive, Maxfield Parrish-type prints on the wall in
beautiful frames -- a weird contrast!
I loaded up a Zabar's freezer bag with food this morning to tide me over for my three
nights here. As I mentioned in a previous blog, the hotel restaurant closed as did my
other go-to place around the corner, Atwater's. The neighborhood's sketchy and I don't
feel like going farther afield, although I've discovered a few good restaurants during my
previous trips.  I can't eat anything past 5:45 tomorrow morning in preparation for my
biopsy, to which my college friend David will escort me, picking me up after the
procedure (he's also 'on duty' on Thursday). Despite (because of?) the circumstances, I
am looking forward to seeing him! He nicely came to visit me in the hospital after my big
debulking surgery in May 2019. 
Nurse Justin left me a voicemail this afternoon to let me know that Aetna has approved
coverage of my treatment at Hopkins - phew.
I'm comfortable in my 'home away from home,' the Marriott Residence Inn Johns Hopkins
Medical Center. The staff is especially kindly as many of their guests are Hopkins
patients. Although there always seem to be a few things awry (today: no tv remote, no
makeup remover wipes, no antiseptic wipes), the rooms are clean and quiet, and I'm
comfortable here.
It was wonderful to see Ben and Sammi this past weekend, albeit somewhat briefly (I'll
                       848 / 1.901
see them soon in NY). Michael grilled hamburgers and hot dogs for us on Saturday night,
an annual tradition. The kids came for brunch on Sunday and helped me with a few
things. They went to the football game on Saturday; there were multiple overtimes and
apparently PSU played miserably. I listened to a few mn of the game on the radio, while
driving around the countryside looking for fresh apple cider and maple syrup (both of
which I found).
Thanks to the 'angels' who sent me texts this a.m. w/well wishes. I appreciated the
sendoff. 
I'll end with a video of Dr. Beavis, whom I write so much about. She lived in England until
she was twelve, and has retained a slight British accent. I won't see her this trip but will
be examined by the oncologist running the clinical trial, Dr. Stephanie Gaillard (I believe
she is French, or of French heritage! We'll soon find out).

Today felt a bit 'unproductive' as the biopsy I was scheduled to have as part of a second
clinical trial did not go forward as planned. The nodule that was to be biopsied,
pinpointed on both a sonogram and then another type of scan to get a better view, was
too small to be useful (of course, I was not unhappy to learn about its small size!). There
are other nodules/tumors in my abdominal/pelvic area, but their location was too
problematic to be of use: one is right near my bowel (which makes me anxious), another
near 'surgical clips' placed during one of my surgeries. While I appreciated the prospect
of helping other women, even myself, by contributing cancerous tissue to this clinical
trial (to be injected into mice along with different types of anti-cancer medications), I
was also extremely relieved that the interventional radiologists were not about to take
any chances trying to perform a needle or core biopsy on me. As the no-nonsense, fifty-
something woman radiologist reminded me, in an appealing accent of some sort
(Iranian?): ""First do no harm. That is our guiding principle."" She explained that
proceeding would not be ""productive,"" as the team would not be able to obtain the
needed sample; this does happen sometimes. Thank you, Hopkins radiologists, for not
risking my health by jabbing at a cm or so large nodule or risking a biopsy near a
sensitive organ. And this type of wise, skilled care is why I make seven hour round trips
to be treated by the world-class physicians at JHMC!
In the context of my visit, it's more important to me, though, that my actual treatment,
scheduled for tomorrow, go well: four appointments beginning at 7:45 (!). I feel
somewhat anxious. Fingers crossed.
The day was salvaged by spending time with my college friend David, who nicely came
and met me at the Residence Inn, waited (briefly, it turned out) while I was prepped for
the biopsy, and then walked me back to the hotel after we had coffee (and, for me, the
first meal of the day as I was off food and drink as of 5:45 this morning). We had such a
nice conversation that ranged over his interesting family history (a great-grandfather
who was an artist of note in Spain, whose fortunes were buffeted by both the Spanish-
American War and the Spanish Civil War, which led him to time in Paris), Harvard
reminiscences, retirement plans, work, family, COVID, Baltimore and more. We have
known each other since we were eighteen! I found his presence comforting; a clinical
psychologist by training, he's a kind, empathic, and steady person. He may meet me
again tomorrow if I feel I need a shoulder to lean on returning to my hotel after a day of
treatment -- I may, though, be able to get an Uber or even walk if I feel up to it. I have no
idea how I'll feel, but fatigued is a safe bet.
I rested for a while when I returned to the hotel around 2 p.m. and then Ubered to a
great Italian bakery (you may have picked up that I have a strange obsession with old
school Italian pastry shops), Vaccaro's, in Baltimore's Little Italy. I enjoyed a delicious
cappuccino and bought a few cookies. I'll try to get to bed early to rise by 6:30 or so
                       853 / 1.901

A brief update on today's events while I still have a bit of energy left. I'm tired from not
sleeping well (nor much) the past two nights and, I suppose, from treatment today.
Things went smoothly. I roused myself (with difficulty!) at 6:30, dressed, ate a banana
and some cottage cheese, and walked to the Viragh Building (for outpatient procedures).
It was a lovely, mild, sunny autumn day and with all my comings and goings today I
walked well over a mile, maybe two. A super friendly, dapper man in a sharp gray suit,
Jesse, whom I might call the 'concierge' or 'maitre d'' or 'mayor' (as I heard others call
him - writing /w/out accents here) of Viragh greeted me, helped me check in at a kiosk,
and pointed me towards my first appointment, telling me to 'keep up my smile' and to
'have a great day.' Slightly hokey, but this cancer patient for one welcomed his affability.
He only confirms my belief that Hopkins staff members are almost universally awesome!
I first went to the lab for blood work. This being my first day of treatment, I actually had
my blood drawn *four* times (and vital signs assessed several times as well), at 8, 10,
noon, and 3! I began to wonder if I'd have any blood left.... The tech, Kia, did not know
whether she should take the blood from my port or a vein in my arm so I called Justin
(my chemo nurse) to ask him and he was able to instruct Kia. I was trying to put my
finger on my feeling/s being around so many very sick people, from skin and bones older
folks supporting themselves on walkers to patients w/oxygen tanks, to a floppy little girl
being moved from a van into a wheelchair. So many feelings: empathy, camaraderie (ie
these are my people), smugness ('they look much sicker than I do'), awareness of
possible denial (""they look much sicker than I do, but my disease is advanced and
metastasizing, so who am I kidding?'), to fear ('this is what's coming??'). Approach.
Avoidance.
After the 8 a.m blood draw I walked back to my hotel to hang out until the next one at
10, stopping at Starbuck's (the only gig in the area for decent coffee) for a cappuccino. I
switched out a few items in my dragonfly-covered tote bag, sent a few texts, rested for
about twenty minutes. I then returned to Viragh to have more blood drawn at 10. After
that, I headed upstairs to the 10th floor, where I met Justin to go over scheduling,
procedures and more. As I suspected from talking with him, he's extremely nice,
answered all my questions patiently, seemed knowledgeable, helpful and
accommodating (eg he helped me switch a few appointment times that conflict with
events I have plans to attend in NY and Baltimore in November). He gave me my first
dose of Fostaniparib (I'll take two pills twice a day, every day), along with a 'diary' in
which to record each dose I take and any comments about side effects. He confirmed
that the two most prevalent possible side effects of this medication are diarrhea (could it
possibly be worse than what I experience now?! Oh my...) and high blood pressure.
Imodium and blood pressure meds can help w/those symptoms.
                       859 / 1.901
Dr. Gaillard came into the examination room while I was speaking with Justin. She's the
medical oncologist running the clinical trial and she was to examine me today as Dr.
Beavis was too overloaded with patients. Another impressive physician: forties (?), full of
energy, friendly, smart (trained at Hopkins, then taught at Duke before returning to
Hopkins as an asst. prof) -- and French! She spells her first name 'the French way'
(Stephanie w/the accent aigu over the first e); like Dr. Beavis, she spent part of her
childhood abroad, in France, as her dad is from Burgundy. Unlike Dr. Beavis, she did not
retain a French accent. We exchanged some words in French for fun; she speaks fluently
w/slightly (American-) accented French, which she also uses when she can with her son,
Luc.
She told me a bit more about the trial. She explained the science behind it quite clearly,
but I'm so scientifically illiterate that it's still a bit challenging for me to understand. Even
though I've taken Taxol before and it lost its effectiveness eventually, taking it with the
Fostaniparib somehow 'resensitizes' the Taxol (Taxol produces a protein that Fosta acts
on directly - I think?), so that the Taxol should become newly effective for me (my
oncologist friend Steve Sherman could undoubtedly explain this better in layperson's
terms). She stressed that the combo of the two drugs *may* be more effective than
taking Taxol alone (which has a 30% effectiveness rate) -- or it may not. Some women,
she told me, have done well on this trial (meaning that their cancer remained stable or
shrunk), others did not. Not knowing in which camp I will fall really sucks (sorry, but
that's the word that seems most appropriate here), esp given the very significant time,
energy and monetary investment involved. A scan after eight weeks should offer some
evidence of whether the treatment is working, provided I continue to tolerate the
treatment well. So.much.uncertainty. Must remain hopeful, or at least sanguine.
I went down to the lobby after my appointments with Justin and Dr. Gaillard, sank into a
comfy chair, ate some curried chicken salad I had brought with me, sent a few texts and
began reading a one-act, Pulitzer Prize winning play (1995) by Margaret Edson called
_Wit,_ about a 50 yo English literature professor with advanced metastatic ovarian
cancer (!). Am only about a third into it, but I like the way the playwright interweaves the
poetry she has spent her life studying (such as Donne's sonnet ""Death be not Proud"")
w/her treatment and the many issues it raises for her (one of her physicians happens to
be one of her former students, for example). It's thought-provoking, and I hope to gather
some ideas for the piece I've been contemplating creating.
A chemo nurse called me to let me know that I could start my infusion early if I wished.
So I headed upstairs to the 6h floor around 1 p.m. or so. A newish nurse plus a more
experienced one took good care of me in a private chemo bay (a nice change from being
in full view of at least ten other patients in the chemo room at Dr. Patel's, although I
don't really mind that). They administered, through my port, pre-meds (Benadryl, pepcid,
Tylenol?, and something else), followed by the Taxol, which ran for about an hour. There
are many possible side effects so it's wait and see (right now I simply feel tired, but
                       860 / 1.901
that's likely from the Benadryl; I fell asleep and when I awoke was disoriented, thinking it
was tomorrow morning already). The side effects usually accumulate the further one
advances into the treatment.
Before leaving Viragh, I wandered into the Meditation Room and flipped through some
books about spirituality from various faiths and 'humanistic' perspectives. Then I just sat
for a while and tried to clear my mind. It's a small, spare room with chairs lining the
walls, which glow with a soft blue-green light. Peaceful. I want to contact Rhonda, the
wonderful chaplain of the Kimmel Cancer Center at JH, whose visits brought me much
comfort after my operations. She's Methodist (I believe) but her perspective is
ecumenical and her prayers always succeeded in articulating my own fears and hopes.
It is not lost on me that today I was supposed to be attending the nineteenth-century
French studies conference about an hour away from here, in D.C., but instead I'm at
Hopkins receiving cancer treatment. I can think of many ways to rationalize this fact to
alleviate my disappointment and maybe even depression over not seeing colleagues
who are friends, presenting my research and learning about theirs, organizing a ""Penn
State dinner"" at an excellent restaurant as several of us often do, etc. but what seems
most helpful for me right now is simply to tell myself that 'this is what I'm doing right
now' and it's necessary. This mantra keeps me focused on the present at least and helps
me direct my energy towards trying to stabilize my health, my priority right now. I'm
certainly bummed, though, but c'est la vie (lol).
The only dreams I remember from my stay here have been college-related (Harvard and
PSU; me as a student, me as a professor): a)a dream involving a guy named Jonathan
Cahn, who I believe was in the class ahead of us, lived in Currier House, and was quite
good-looking and b)anxiety dream: I have to write an exam for my French culture/history
class on very short notice. I feel confident that I can cut corners, for example by cutting
and pasting from some previous documents, but when I realize that this really won't be
possible, and when I further realize that 1)I've focused nearly exclusively in the course
on World Wars I and II to the detriment of nearly everything else I was supposed to cover
and 2)I may not even have shown up to many of the class sessions I was supposed to
teach, I start to panic. During all of this, I'm also supposed to go to the office of a (real-
life) colleague in the English department, Carla M., but I can't find her office.
Back to SC tomorrow with my friend Martina who is nicely driving down to pick me up (i
look forward to some giggles), then I'll have one day to pack for NY, leaving Sunday
morning. And this is what I'm doing right now...

The last week has been a blur for me but – now that I’ve procured a ‘hotspot’ from AT&T
enabling me to access the internet from my cousin Claudia’s place – I will try to recap as
best as possible.
My State College friend Deb kindly drove me to the city last Sunday – her husband Tony
had packed up some delicious smoked salmon sandwiches for us to enjoy along the way.
We chatted the whole time and the four++ hour drive zipped by; fortunately, traffic
wasn’t bad getting into the city. She dropped me at my mother’s place and continued to
her place in Chelsea.
I actually don’t remember much about what I did Monday-Wednesday (a blur, as
mentioned, compounded by pretty awful insomnia, my mind working overtime like a
machine I can’t turn off…). I wrote a few letters of recommendation and caught up on
emails. I met Ben briefly twice, once in Union Square, the second time when he helped
me transport most of my stuff to Claudia and Jorn’s loft on Wednesday. My mother and I
went out for thin-crust pizza at a great place in her neighborhood, Posto. We also took a
walk up to Kalustyan’s, an iconic New York international store, where I bought some salt
(they sell dozens of varieties of salt from all over the world) and my mother bought some
halvah (Israeli marble halvah, one of dozens of varieties they sell). We also went, in
“Curry Hill,” to a wonderful store crammed full of clothing, home décor and much more
from India. Somehow I had gotten hooked on the idea that a fitted quilted sleeveless
reversible Indian vest w an attractive pattern would make a nice addition to my
wardrobe, and I indeed found what I was looking for (I was enthralled by the beautiful
shimmering wraps, skirts and jewelry that Indian women wear for their weddings in the
most gorgeous “Monsoon Wedding” colors but felt that it was best to simply admire
those items from a culturally appropriate distance!).
Everything went smoothly at Hopkins on Thursday. I woke up at an ungodly early hour
(for me) to catch an Uber to meet my brother, who kindly agreed to accompany me,
outside the new Moynihan Station that is replacing (or enlarging?) Penn Station. After a
few sips of cappuccino, I perked up enough to notice how spectacular this station is,
harking back to the grand 19th century stations of steel and glass but with a sleek,
modern, open, airy feel. Much less dreary-creepy than timeworn Penn Station. The train
was very comfortable, and I believe I dozed through a good part of the nearly three-hour
trip; when I awoke sunlight was glinting onto Chesapeake Bay. Ethan had packed up
some goodies from New York that supplemented my much more modest few items, and I
was grateful for the bagels w/cream cheese and smoked salmon and some yummy tuna
salad from Absolute Bagels on the UWS.
We Ubured to Hopkins where I first met with Dr. Beavis and Justin, the nurse ‘assigned’
to me for the duration of the trial. He’s an excellent nurse, totally focused on making
                       867 / 1.901
things go as smoothly for me as possible. He always answers my emails within a few
minutes, and is thorough, caring, and knowledgeable. Vitals checked, everything fine,
fortunately no high blood pressure as anticipated with the Fostamatinib. Dr. Beavis
briefly examined me (lungs, mouth, abdomen/pelvis) to make sure I was ‘good to go’ for
treatment (apparently, I was). She issued new prescriptions for a few of my meds that
were running low; we talked about how to best deal with my insomnia and dehydration
due to diarrhea. We also discussed logistics for trying to get me in to see a gyn onc
surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering for a consult. Dr. Beavis suggested this initially both
as a ‘foot in the door’ measure if I were ever to need urgent care while in NY and as a
way of assessing whether MSK might be running any promising trials for me down the
road. This is one of many points that have proved complicated in recent weeks (my
initial call to MSK, last week, was met with the news that I can’t schedule a consult there
until I complete my current trial at JHMC – this turns out not to be the case…I think…).
There have been more ‘hiccups’ than I can even count and I need to remain very
proactive to stay on top of the myriad details involved in my care. I’ll allude to some of
these hiccups here, but can’t get into all of them in detail, including a dilemma about
attending, in my immunocompromised state, an upcoming family bar-mitzvah in
Baltimore at which numerous folks with whom I’d love to visit will not have been
vaccinated. I used to have a pillowcase depicting a cat from the Boynton comic trying to
jump over the moon – unsuccessfully – and the slogan: “Nothing in life is simple” – an apt
motto for me these days…
I next went to the lab in another building to have bloodwork to determine whether I
could proceed with treatment. I had actually messed up semi-big time with this as I
forgot that I was supposed to have the bloodwork done the day before, in New York (for
some reason this had totally slipped my mind). It turned out to be ok, simply delaying
treatment quite a bit until all the results of the bloodwork could be processed and my
chemo meds ordered and mixed. I was mad at myself for this slip up. Fortunately, my
blood counts were all sufficiently robust enough to not raise any red flags and I was able
to proceed to treatment.
Treatment lasted about 2.5-3 hours. A big blast of Benadryl made me quite groggy but
didn’t put me to sleep and the Taxol (chemo) took an hour to administer. Ethan sat in the
chemo room with me while I was attended to by two nurses, Sarah and Nicole. I think we
finished up about 5:30.
Of course, I have no idea of whether the treatment is effective and will not know until I
have a scan – my hunch is that won’t be until towards the end of the year. It is possible
that all this poison is being pumped into my body for no effect. As mentioned, Taxol has
about a 30-32% effectiveness rate, which may or may not be improved by the additional
med (Fostamatinib, a drug used for autoimmune conditions) that I am taking per my
participation in the clinical trial. My last CA 125 number was 33, technically considered
‘normal’ (up to 35) but slightly high for me; it appears, though, that we are basically
                       868 / 1.901
ditching this number as a barometer of my cancer, and instead going with the scans,
which have proved more revealing. So it’s wait and see. I can decide to leave the trial at
any point but…for what alternative? My current plan is to stick with the trial until a)my
doctors determine the treatment is not effective for me (ie cancer has progressed)
and/or b)the side effects become unmanageable (so far they are manageable).
After treatment I felt well enough to walk back to the hotel (1/3 mile), especially after
having been cooped up all day. Somehow I was ravenously hungry, so I suggested to
Ethan that we Uber to an old school Italian restaurant I like a lot, La Scala. I was so
hungry (or perhaps it was pent up energy making itself known) that I ate a hearty bowl
of homemade spinach fettuccini with Bolognese sauce (delicious) preceded by half a
grilled Caesar salad and followed by a huge piece of tiramisu, my favorite dessert (I had
said to the waiter, when he brought it over, “I fear you may need to bring me a box for
me to take half of this home.” When he brought the box over: Guess what?). I apologize
for seeming gluttonous; I don’t entirely understand the nature of the deep hunger I felt
after my day of treatment. Something is going on with that. All the uncertainty is
perturbing and it is sometimes difficult for me to remain calm.
It was so nice to have time to catch up with Ethan over dinner and throughout the day,
to trade news of our kids, our lives, to check in with each other. If the reason for my trip
to Hopkins was sobering, I declared the opportunity to spend quality brother-sister time
together “even fun!”
As I mentioned in last week’s blog, the quality of the service at our go-to hotel has
definitely descended several notches. This time there were stains on the towels and
bedding, sofa bed was not made up etc. They were likely hard hit during the pandemic.
The staff remains lovely. However, I am contemplating trying to make next week’s trip in
one day, if possible.
Did not sleep very well but Ethan had nicely gone to Starbuck’s before I got up and had
my coffee waiting for me. Ubured to Penn Station, a pretty Beaux-Arts station from 1911
that would be a suitable movie set for a film set in that era. Return train very crowded
w/weekenders and some likely NY marathoners.
Somehow things decomposed once we arrived back in NY – nothing horrible but enough
annoyances to precipitate a mini-meltdown on my part. The glorious November weather
invited walking, so I walked from 32nd and 7th to Claudia and Jorn’s place on W. 15th.
Somewhere along the way my right shoe began to chafe against my toe, sending searing
pain through my foot as I walked. I plunked my stuff down in the loft, then set out again
to pick up the prescriptions Dr. Beavis had ordered from a CVS near my mother’s
apartment (about ten blocks from the loft). I was also hurrying so that I could get to my
mother’s in time to have her help me bring the rest of my stuff, which I had left at her
house, back to the loft with me. The CVS episode was an epic fail: apparently my
                       869 / 1.901
insurance for medications was rejected and they couldn’t fill my prescriptions (several of
which have run out and I need them…); I was able to buy potassium at full price (I will
not be able to do this w/the blood thinner Eliquis, which costs $500 without insurance). I
called my CVS in State College to try to find out what was going on and could not get the
info I needed; I’ll need to make some more phone calls. Meanwhile, the pharmacy in NY
was very crowded and the pharmacists were both truly unpleasant, yelling at me in front
of all the other customers! By that point I was in nearly full-blown meltdown and so I left
the store, forgetting to pick up the Benadryl I need to sleep (I stopped at another place a
few blocks away to pick that up, along with some toe guards to alleviate the searing pain
in my foot). It was too late for my mother to help me so I packed up my remaining stuff
in her apartment and took an Uber back to the loft, even though it’s walking distance –
between my throbbing foot, my very heavy bag, and my fatigue I was spent! I ordered
some too-salty Udon soup via Door Dash, which did not help w/my dehydration.
Claudia and Jorn’s beautiful loft provides wonderful respite for me. Still, it took me
forever to fall asleep last night but once I was out I slept soundly and late. Still felt some
‘decrepitude’ this morning – is my hair starting to fall out again? another inner mouth
sore? – but tried to ‘right’ myself. My mother met me at Breads Bakery for coffee and
rolls/pastries and then nicely accompanied me to AT&T to get my hotspot set up; to
DSW, to buy myself some unattractive but comfortable and functional Sketchers to
replace the offending pair of shoes that wreaked havoc on my feet; and to the farmers
market to buy a few healthy items to eat/cook the next few days (eggs, cheese, veggies,
fruit). Union Square was bustling; I had rarely seen the farmers market and surrounding
stores, restaurants, cafes etc. so lively and packed. New York is back? The grand
weather and Marathon weekend fever certainly helped.
The next few days will be a mix of rest and seeing a few friends and relatives – an
advantage of being in the city. Looking forward to brunching w/my friend Shanny
tomorrow. Will write more about plans for next Thursday’s Hopkins jaunt soon. Despite
the preceding account (I feel sheepish for whining but needed to vent), the bottom line is
that I’m feeling pretty much ok, well enough to plow through everything I’ve just
described.
Thanks very much to everyone who has sent emails and texts of support from near and
far. Your words lift me up! Missing all my friends in State College. It is nice to spend
some time with dear ones in the city, though. XO

227,"Recent dreams both take me back in time: 1) people (students) are sitting against the
wall in the long hallway running through the apartment I grew up in, in Gramercy Park.
They are taking a math test or exam. I am supposed to take the test too, but don't have
it in hand, and can't see anywhere to sit. I finally obtain the test and proceed into the
large living room in our old apartment to find a seat; I'm the only one in the room.
Trepidation about taking a test in math, a subject I'm notoriously bad at.
2)Standing on a sidewalk watching a car go by, and realize that the driver is a very
young (age 4-7) Ben! I am amazed/anxious to see him at the wheel of a car. I feel that I
must tell him that the age for procuring a driver's license is eighteen!
The past few days have had their stresses and frustrations -- [update: but things
improved as the week continued]. Thankfully, I am feeling pretty ok physically. I don't
know if it's even worth describing the insurance nightmare that engulfed me for three
days, sparked by my being banished from a CVS on 22nd st. twice because the mean
pharmacists said my insurance claim had been rejected, preventing me from buying two
medications I badly needed and that I had to forego taking for about five days. While I
paid out of pocket for potassium and vitamin B12, Eliquis (blood thinner) costs $500 sans
insurance and Lexapro (anti-depressant) costs close to $60. Suffice to say I held off on
purchasing both these meds. This problem, which of course I had to resolve one way or
another, set in motion about 20 (?) phone calls on my part to a)the medical insurance
company (Aetna); b) the insurance company covering my prescriptions (Caremark/CVS);
c)Lifetime Benefits Solutions (billing company for Aetna and Caremark) and d) Penn
State Human Resources. A) would send me to b) would send me to c) would send me to
d), like a ping pong ball, and being off my anti-depressant did not help during those mind-
numbing waits, navigation of phone trees etc., when I could practically hear the veins in
my temple and neck pulsing loudly. I believe the reps I spoke to truly wanted to help me,
and were all pleasant, but it took a long time to untangle the different strands of the
problem (my insurance policy was listed as 'expired,' leaving me with no medical or
prescription coverage).
Again without going into equally mind-numbing detail, it turned out that I had been
delinquent on payments to my insurance company (news to me; something about the
mode of payment apparently changed when I retired and I didn't get the memo). So I
certainly accept responsibility for this and have now set up my post-retirement insurance
policy payments to be withdrawn directly from my bank. I am not positive, however,
whether it was my lack of payment that precipitated all my coverage being cancelled,
but it appears that this may have been the culprit. Once I paid up over the phone, to the
                       877 / 1.901
billing company (which I did immediately, of course), I was able to get Penn State to
reactivate both my medical insurance and prescription coverage, in concert with both
Aetna and Caremark. I *think* the medical part has been reinstated now as I once again
'exist' as an entity on Aetna's website (ie my id card has reappeared there), and am
waiting for the prescription coverage to kick in again as well. [update: as of yesterday,
the entirety of my coverage has been reinstated! Cost for my Eliquis and Lexapro at
Hopkins pharmacy yesterday: $.0. Insurance doesn't cover the pricey mouthwash I will
take to deal with chemo induced mouth and tongue sores, but I'll cough up - no pun
intended - $40 for the stuff].
Update: I realize that as an American, I complain about insurance coverage from a
position of privilege. A dear friend who just lost her brother to cancer in Beirut, a city in a
country in dire shape, reported that her family had to pay for his cancer care out of
pocket because of the country's financial/economic crisis. And even in this country so
many go without adequate insurance. I am extremely lucky to benefit from such
excellent care and more than adequate insurance coverage.
The second major 'pain' of the first part of the week revolved around my needing to have
labs drawn in the city, with the results to be faxed to Hopkins. I located a Quest
Diagnostics lab near the loft; their claim to take appointments both by phone and on line
being apparently false, I walked over there a few days ago to make sure that I could
indeed have my blood drawn there. In reality, they only take walk ins. I returned there
the following day and waited for a very long time. The place looked dirty to me and did
not inspire confidence. When I inquired about whether they had a record of my having
signed in, the technician barked at me: ""Silverman? We called your name several times
already."" The fact was that the technicians do not even enter the waiting room to call the
next client but simply announce the name barely audibly from a room around the corner
from the waiting room. Oh well. Unfortunately, the technician either did not pinpoint my
vein accurately and/or did not apply enough pressure after removing the needle. As soon
as I left the lab and crossed the street, I felt something cold and wet leaking into my
jacket arm. I removed my jacket and saw blood covering the entire inside of the sleeve
and seeping into my shirtsleeve as well. Somewhat panicked, I sat down on the ledge of
a shop, found a tissue in my bag and began applying pressure as blood continued to turn
the tissue red. This was my 'breaking point' and I began sobbing loudly as I tried to stop
the bleeding. Granted, I was five days off Lexapro, lacking sleep, and more 'unregulated'
than I suspected. Despite my sobs, the midday crowd on 22nd street surged blithely past
me, engrossed in their cell phones; the only person who continued to stare at me with
concern as she walked by was a little girl. I flagged a uniformed man who looked like a
police offer (""Are you an officer? Could you help me?""). He turned out to be a traffic
officer but said he would get a police officer to come over. No one came. By this time, I
had calmed down a bit, stopped the bleeding, and headed into the store whose ledge I
was crumpled onto, which happened to be the large newish Harry Potter store where my
niece works; I had intended to stop by to visit her after my blood draw. It was strange --
                       878 / 1.901
and probably helpful in some way -- to go from this awful experience into the alternate
universe of Slytherin and Griffyndor, where you can buy a magician's wand for $38. The
design of the shop is actually quite cool and it was packed. It took me quite a while to
find Eve -- it's a large, two-floor shop -- but eventually I located her in an attractive room
with Harry Potter wallpaper that sells graphic art inspired by the series. Fortunately she
had a bandaid on her and we were able to chat and have a co-worker of hers take
pictures of us in front of a faux fireplace. Despite my mood, it was lovely to see my dear
niece and give her a hug.
Nothing in life is simple: the Boynton pillowcase I alluded to in a recent post features, of
course, a *cow* trying unsuccessfully to jump over the moon, not a cat. Duh.
The second half of the week improved. I will post some pictures illustrating that
statement in a next post. 
My Hopkins trip yesterday went smoothly. I decided to experiment with going and
coming in one day, and foregoing having someone accompany me on the trip, although
my former bro in law Bruce had kindly offered. A one-day trip is tiring, I found, but
entirely feasible. I felt slightly 'befuddled' at times when I was there simply because it
was such a relatively rushed day but the entire staff is so unfailingly pleasant and
professional that it put me in good spirits. Despite my early wake up time, I made it to
Moynihan Station slightly after 7:30, had time to grab a Starbucks and make the 8:10
train. It was a pretty day, the late autumn foliage glinted shades of bright orange and
red, and the sight of houses with docks leading right onto Chesapeake Bay was lovely. In
perhaps a last gasp from this 'week from hell,' I had an unnerving cabbie drive me to
Hopkins. He kept defending himself energetically and loudly from (my??? no!)
insinuations that he might be cheating me somehow, a strange stew of references to
Holy Books, the fact that his parents raised him right, and a mind-numbing repetition of
the random phrase ""Experience is the best teacher."" After telling me it was fine to pay
by credit card, he somehow messed up my payment, and began chiding me for not going
to a cash machine before getting into his cab (there is no cash machine in the station in
Baltimore). Next time, I'll take an Uber; at this point, I think their drivers definitely have
the edge on the cabbie. Oh well.
I arrived in ample time to have more blood drawn. As mentioned in a previous post, a
dapper, emphatically friendly man named Jesse (photo next time?) greets patients in the
lobby of Viragh Building and helps register them, printing off their itinerary if they need.
He remembered me from previous visits and told me to keep smiling (under my mask!).
We also compared the purples in our clothing. I told him I was a ""purple person"" and he
then showed me his amazing purple striped socks and classy, pointy, crisply polished
dress shoes. My technician for the blood draw, Natasha, was also kind and friendly. We
talked about her twin daughters and how bored they are working and living in suburban
PA (Lebanon). She expertly drew the blood from my port and set everything up for my
                       879 / 1.901
receiving chemo through my port in the afternoon.
When I finished in the phlebotomy lab, Justin (the nurse assigned to me for the duration
of the trial) was waiting for me, as promised. As mentioned, Justin is an exceptionally
good nurse, completely on top of my care, efficient, kind, empathic. He shared the
results of the blood draw from Quest Diagnostic (thankfully, the lab did fax him the
results!), showing me which counts were slightly high or low. Fortunately, though, the
overall picture remains good enough for me to continue treatment at this point. Justin
then directed me to the cafeteria (even telling me about an app allowing patients to find
their way in the huge, and to me confusing labyrinth that is JHMC). He went off to attend
to a few details of my care (I think?) and then met me at the cafeteria, where I was able
to ask him some questions on the way to Dr. Beavis' office. He joined Dr. Beavis and me
at her office, both of them collaborating on different aspects of my care (eg possibly
lowering my dose of Fostamatinib if my bad diarrhea continues; coordinating the
handover of treatment beginning in December with Dr. Patel, with whom Justin had
spoken by phone). I told Dr. Beavis that sometimes I can feel the tumors in my pelvic
area ache when I wake up; she said this is normal but does not necessarily indicate
growth, shrinkage etc.; the aching could be coming from the tumors or scar tissue, but I
definitely feel them. I've been walking a lot in the city, and she encourages that. She
examined me briefly (chest/breathing, vitals, mouth, pelvis/abdomen) and nothing
warranted withholding treatment. I also told her (and Justin) -- thinking it superfluous but
it actually is not, at all, as central to the question of quality of life -- that, providing I'm
still feeling up to it, I'd like to travel to my 'happy place' for a week or two, likely in
January, with a few fabulous women friends from State College. Dr. Beavis and Justin
both seemed supportive of that idea and can apparently work with me to tweak the
schedule slightly if necessary. Dr. Beavis thought it was high time to think about booking
plane tickets to Paris. So I need to get on this asap.
In the midst of my appointment i got a call from Caremark to say that any restrictions on
my prescription coverage had been lifted. Relief.
Justin had also printed out a schedule for me going forward. Next Thursday I'll be at
Hopkins for blood work (collection of samples for the clinical trial, I will not have to
retraumatize myself at Quest Diagnostics again this week) and to briefly be examined by
Dr. Beavis; I won't be having treatment that day (a scheduled break in the treatment
after three sessions). The following week I'll be off completely for Thanksgiving. I'll return
to Hopkins, likely from State College, once in early December for bloodwork/Dr. Beavis or
Dr. Gaillard/treatment. After that, Dr. Patel will begin administering my treatment and I
will travel to Hopkins once a month to be examined and have a check in, blood draw etc.
I will have a scan at the very end of December, which the Hopkins radiologists will
analyze. This will likely tell us a lot about the effectiveness - or not - of the treatment.
Accordingly, my treatment plan may or may not need to be modified; it's likely, though,
that I'll at least start the third cycle of treatment in early January.
                       880 / 1.901
After meeting w/Dr. Beavis and Justin, I walked back to Viragh Building for treatment. My
college friend David Miranda, who lives in Baltimore, had kindly reached out to me to see
if I needed help 'on the ground,' as he had done the same for me two (?) weeks ago.
While I was having treatment David - my 'care partner' for the day, in Hopkins' parlance
(and he received the badge to prove it) -- picked up my prescriptions and a vanilla bean
yogurt for me, and then returned to the treatment room where he found me loopy from
being pumped full of Benadryl (it took me about 20 minutes to post a picture of Arnold
marching in the NYC Veterans Day parade in his original WWII uniform when normally it
would take me 5 minutes). Because I was groggy from the treatment (administered
expertly and compassionately by Nicole, an infusion room nurse), David accompanied
me in an Uber back to Penn Station Baltimore, where I was able to exchange my ticket
for one on an earlier train. Once he made sure I was solid enough post-treatment we
parted ways. What an angel and how pleasant it is to chat w/him and learn about each
other's lives. I'm so grateful that we've reconnected, even under these circumstances.
One of the mini-silver linings. At the same time, I send prayers and healing wishes to
another classmate, Brenda, whom I never knew in college but whom I've met virtually in
the past year or so due to our common OC journey. Brenda is struggling right now. I
hope her health improves.
Train was crowded back to the city around 5:40, but comfortable. A guy sitting behind
me was coughing and incessantly blowing his nose for the first hour and a half, so much
so that I inquired whether he was ok. After that his honking and blowing and coughing
stopped and he launched into a very loud cell phone call (to whom??) during which he
announced that ""A fun fact about me is that I have nine brothers."" Life can really suck
sometimes, to paraphrase something my friend Shanny wrote a few of us the other day.
Fortunately, she noted, at other times it can be joyful and funny and absurd. QED.
Will write a second post w/photos of some of the recent ""joyful and funny"" moments of
the past week.
Rereading my post, I realize that my 'mot du jour' appears to be ""mind-numbing."" While
it's a great word (imho), please know that the past week has not been *completely* mind-
numbing! Perhaps it's balanced by my other 'mot du jour' (which I know I overuse...):
""lovely.""

For many years, every time I attempted to take a picture of a pretty landscape or
building or animals in my beloved, late ex-mother-in-law's presence, she would snap at
me: ""No pictures without people!"" Eventually, even she, sometimes a bit of a
bossypants, realized how over the top this statement was, and we came to joke about
(it's remained a bit of a family joke since). However, obeying Annette's dictum, I present
to you...""pictures with people!"" Specifically, some of the people who have brightened my
days during the past week or so.

All these pictures were taken at the opening a few nights ago at the National Arts Club
on Gramercy Park (a stone's throw from the building in which I grew up; I used to take
piano lessons in the NAC) of the exhibit of photographs by my friend, Laurent Badessi.
The exhibit, ""Age of Innocence,"" is about children and gun culture in America. When I
was 22, I taught English as an assistante at the Lycee Theodore Aubanel (sorry for
missing accents) in Avignon, France. Laurent was my 18 or 17 year old student. He came
from a family of photographers and was dreaming of becoming one himself; he was
already experimenting with his friends, and I have photos he took of me forty years ago
and over the years (including for the jacket of my first book). I came to know his late
grandparents quite well, staying at their beautiful home in Villeneuve-les-Avignon, and I
know his parents as well. We have cultivated a very special relationship over the past
forty years. I'm hoping that soon he'll create a portrait photograph of me on a 'vanitas'
theme (I have ideas...). The opening was full of impossibly chic New Yorkers and was lots
of fun.

My current treatment may be starting to become a harder slog for me. I feel tired, and
today at least need to lie down for a while every two hours or so. Aching in my pelvis
woke me about 4 a.m. the other night (that 'witching hour' 'entre chien et loup'
('between dog and wolf' when reputedly most suicides occur, a 'fun fact' that has
remained lodged in my brain since a former therapist shared it with me); before I knew
it, I was trying to settle myself by getting to ""Genius"" in the NYTimes ""Spelling Bee"" and
reading through all the Sunday ""Vows"" accounts. I feel nauseous some mornings, usually
resolved with an anti-nausea med, Compazine or Zofran.  I have awful diarrhea, which
may result in our having to reduce the amount of Fostamatinib (clinical trial med) I
receive each day, after we attempt to control it with another anti-diarrheal med aside
from Immodium (of which I now take eight per day). I'm constantly battling dehydration.
My hair is falling out in handfuls, big clumps, for the second time. It took well over a year
for it to grow back. While Katherine, my trusted 'wig lady' in State College, has promised
to make me look beautiful, I wonder how many times my body can regenerate in this
way; I have in mind a poem about Ophelia, in French, by the Belgian Symbolist poet
Georges Rodenbach I believe, which describes Ophelia's hair disaggregating in the water
and becoming one with the surrounding weeds, reeds, foliage, ferns and other plant life
in a very natural way, all dissolving and melding into one organic swirl. I wish I could
locate that poem. The hair loss this time feels less traumatic than the first but perhaps
more agitating, exhausting (>the concern about the effort it will take to keep up my
appearance, which somehow still matters to me as fairly central to my identity), 'here we
go again'-ing. I'm likely most concerned, actually, about not shedding hair around my
cousin's apartment, so I've revived my collection of soft caps for the occasion (I even
brought my wig from State College, but it looks a bit timeworn). 
I often lie awake at all hours and worry about my cancer. What if the current treatment is
not working? What if I'm not among the lucky 30% -- maybe more with the added clinical
trial medication -- that will benefit from this treatment? What does the nausea mean, the
pelvic aches (they could mean something or nothing, according to Dr. Beavis), the
fatigue? What risks do I run by perhaps letting my cancer go untreated for so long? What
if errant cancer cells make a break for it, sneaking into my lungs or brain? 
Ok, back to the mantra: ""One day at a time."" Focus on the breathing. Listen to a guided
Yoga Nidra meditation on YouTube. Being surrounded by family and friends in NY the
past few weeks has been grounding, a blessing. So comforting to text my mother in the
late morning and ask if she wants to meet at Breads Bakery in a half hour for coffee and
a croissant, before we pick up a few items at the farmers market; yesterday we walked
three miles around the Village, winding up at Veselka for delicious mushroom barley
soup (I took home equally delicious borscht for dinner). Lovely to have Ben drop by after
his classes are done. Calming to spend time with old friends.
                       908 / 1.901
I responded to a slew of emails today but have more to catch up on. I am so very
grateful for the emails, texts, voicemails, dream interpretations, gifts (thank you, Helen,
for the tea!). Please be patient with me while I do so. I often have the best intentions but
then become overcome with fatigue and need to lie down. Yesterday this turned into a
four-hour nap!
PS: Despite my reference to the hour when most suicides occur, please know that I am at
no risk of this! I might only consider this if I were to be in truly unbearable physical pain
-- and I am nowhere *near* that point -- although I remain convinced that such pain can
nowadays be managed with meds. I could certainly write more about this, but those who
know me well understand that I have a very strong spirit that is buoying me during this
cancer journey. Moreover, I am eminently well surrounded by 'good companions.'",5,sadness,0.4861888,0.0059005274,0.019989606,0.39154017,0.00844618,0.03019921,0.4861888,0.05773546

Yesterday I completed my fifth (I think??) consecutive trip to Baltimore in as many
weeks, and the second in a row organized as a one-day round trip. As expected, it's been
a tiring proposition but overall it's gone smoothly, and my decision to make NY my home
base for the better part of the month was a good one.
Same drill as last week: I awoke at 6:30 (preceded by a miserable sleep that had me
waking up *hourly*), ate half an almond croissant from Breads Bakery and some
delicious labne mixed with apricot jam from Kalustyan, threw a few items into a tote bag,
Ubered to Moynihan Train Hall, grabbed a cappuccino, and boarded the 8:10 train to
Baltimore. The under three hour ride is easy and relaxing and pretty: I enjoyed seeing
big bodies of water (Chesapeake Bay) that are unknown to us in landlocked central PA. In
Philly, sculls were cutting ripples into the Schuylkill as they rowed by, as I observed from
above while we crossed a bridge. The late autumn reds and gold still abounded on this
sunny day.
Ubured to the Viragh Building for my blood work (nice driver: we talked about benefits of
life in the country, where he wants to retire with his Black Labs, Jericho and Simon, v. the
city); all went according to plan. I showed the technician the hematoma now covering
the entire inside of my elbow, the mark of the technician at Quest Diagnostics in NY who
not only harmed me during  a blood draw gone wrong but, to add insult to injury, got
angry with me for apparently not hearing her when she called (whispered?) my name
when she was ready for me. The Hopkins technician/phlebotomist brought over a woman
who looked like a supervisor -- perhaps a physician, RN or more experienced
phlebotomist. She examined my arm thoroughly, parsed the different parts of the wound
(hematoma, adhesive burn, vein etc.), and recommended applying bacitracin and
covering loosely, scrupulously avoiding using that arm for any blood draws in the near
future. She gave me all the supplies needed to care for/cover the wound. Although
relatively 'low hanging fruit,' this is precisely the type of expertise, thoroughness and
superb patient care I have come to expect from Hopkins.
I then had time for a very quick lunch in the cafeteria at Hopkins before my appointment
with Dr. Beavis. The massive medical complex still seems like a labyrinth to me and I use
an app to navigate. At least I get some exercise walking from one end to the other.
Justin met me at Dr. Beavis' with orders for my next blood draw. I had vitals taken (bp
still good!). I first met with Dr. Schneider, a fellow (?) working w/Dr. Beavis, then with
both Drs. Schneider and Beavis. Without going into graphic detail, I can share that some
of the convo centered on peeing and pooping! Suffice to say that some of the
medications can prompt difficult side effects, paradoxically both diarrhea from hell and
urinary *retention* (I wondered if this might be the result of a tumor pressing on the
bladder but Dr. Beavis strongly suspects the medications and did not feel anything
                       913 / 1.901
during her physical examination of me). Dr. Beavis is very skilled at tweaking the
dosages of my meds and hopefully we'll get things sorted out. As an update, Justin called
me this morning to tell me to hold the Fostamatinib (the drug I'm taking along with
Taxol, as part of the trial) for two weeks, until my next appointment, as my neutrophil
count (white blood cells) is low; this is the recommendation of Dr. Gaillard, the medical
oncologist running the trial. It is not uncommon for dosages of meds to be reduced/
increased/stopped during treatment and Justin thinks I'll be likely to resume the
Fostamatinib in early December. Dr. Beavis and I briefly discussed a range of other
issues, from sleep problems to a toenail that appears to be darkening and loosening
from chemo to whether we should increase my Lexapro to help me cope w/the
understandable anxiety that comes with being an ovarian cancer patient; on that note, I
am very happy to have reconnected with Rhonda Cooper, the chaplain for the Kimmel
Cancer Center at JHMC, to whom I wrote a few days ago. Rhonda, a Methodist minister,
provided much comfort following my first operation; I found praying together for healing
and strength, for myself and my loved ones, very powerful and I am looking forward to
seeing her during my December trip to Hopkins. Dr. Beavis and her husband are loading
up their bikes onto their car (they're both avid cyclists) and are off to celebrate the
holiday with friends. We realized that the next time I see her it will be Chanukah (her
husband, Josh, is Jewish).
I was finished before 2 p.m. so I Ubured back to Penn Station, Baltimore, and exchanged
my ticket for one for a train leaving an hour earlier; that one, however, was half an hour
late so my net time gain returning to the city was only half an hour! The train (w/a
terminus in Boston) was quite crowded and seemed to be transporting many college
students returning home for the holiday I am *so* glad not to be travelling for
Thanksgiving, as I'm returning to State College on Sunday, with Ben (Sammi will arrive
on Tuesday).
I was very tired when I reached to the city but also hungry and, realizing I had little food
in the apartment, spontaneously stopped in Koreatown to have some galbi (had a
craving for beef). The meat was tasty but also rather greasy; the sides were so-so; and
the soup wasn't good. I don't think I picked the best place, but it was ok. I also felt a bit
overcome by the throngs of people, the congestion and the noise, including that blaring
from a huge Korean BBQ place on the corner of 32nd and 5th, called LOVE. I know this is
hardly written ""like a true New Yorker"" but I'm realizing that there are certain
neighborhoods in the city I have to avoid! I love the city of course and am at home here
but feel much more relaxed in more residential or mixed, 'throng-free' neighborhoods.
I was so tired when I got back to the apartment, which I had left twelve hours earlier,
that I crawled into bed with a _People_ magazine. I experimented with no sleep meds at
all and...guess what? I slept better than I had in quite a while. It wasn't perfect -- I fell
asleep fairly quickly and only awoke about two times during the night -- but I am going to
continue to further experiment with med-free sleep and better sleep 'hygiene.' To this
                       914 / 1.901
end, I thank my brother for the analgesic balm from China, in a lovely bottle to boot, that
feels relaxing when rubbed into the temples.
My stay in NY is winding down. My mother, Ethan and I shared a NY coffee shop lunch
yesterday (fat tuna salad sandwich on rye toast + good fries); can't remember the last
time the three of us did *that.* Such a nice moment. Later that day, Ben popped over for
a visit and I enjoyed the added bonus of being able to briefly chat with my cousin Claudia
in her apartment as I was returning and she leaving. I wish I had been able to spend
more time with her over the years but we're making up for lost time!
A highlight of the week was also seeing my *grade school* friend, Sarah. It's safe to say
we have known each other for about 56 years, and we hadn't seen each other in at least
ten if not more! Since I graduated in a class of about (?) thirty women, I've remained
close or at least kept in touch with the majority of them. It's a blessed sisterhood. Sarah
(who looks the same!) was kind enough to take the train in from her home in CT to have
a great Mexican lunch with me at Rosa Mexicano. As she works in an independent
bookstore in New Canaan (Aunt Marlene, you must know it, on Elm St.?) and is an avid
reader, she also recently sent me a book that I am looking forward to digging into soon.
We talked about everything including news of our classmates, memories of our
classmates' parents (the one who wore a fur coat; the one who smoked cigarettes from a
long holder; the one who smoked pot; the one who broke barriers for women in law
school) and our older and wiser perspectives on our Nightingale days. Sarah, who is now
a grandmother (!), seems to enjoy a wonderful life and I'm so happy for her. Sarah, Eva,
Jill, Jane, Zia and Lisa, thank you for reading my blog and especially for your friendship; if
I've left anyone out *please* know that it's due to a senior moment and is not
intentional!
Looking forward to seeing a few more dear friends in the city before I leave on Sunday.

I'm back in Baltimore for treatment (and other appointments) tomorrow, having driven
here from PA earlier (easy drive, with stop for lunch at Alvaro's in Harrisburg). After
tomorrow, I'll be able to receive chemotherapy in State College, while travelling to
Baltimore once a month (and not once a week) for a checkup. My next trip here is slated
for Dec. 30th (anyone wanna come with me?).
I was hoping for my own private Chanukah 'miracle' -- perhaps like in a Hallmark movie
or _A Christmas Carol_ or _It's a Wonderful Life_ -- where the 'spirit of the season'
envelops the main characters in goodness and light --when I finally got up the courage to
look at the results of my bloodwork from yesterday, and especially my Ca125 number.
Alas, that number has more than doubled in the past two and a half months, jumping
from 22.7 in September to 45.1 yesterday. I am almost certain that a result from
October, though, was not recorded; as I recall, it was in the low 30s. Anything above 38
is considered high. Even though Dr. Beavis has told me that we need to consider the
abdominal/pelvic/chest scan (currently scheduled for Dec. 27th) as more
revelatory/predictive than the CA125 number, as any number of factors can distort that
number (ovarian cancer marker), I can't help but feel bummed by this result, the highest
since August, when it hit about 51. Does the result suggest that the current course of
chemo is not effective? And if so, what are the implications of that? Is this a preview of
the scan? Or should it be disregarded? Taken with a grain of salt? How do I interpret it in
light of feeling relatively well the past weeks and even months? Ovarian cancer can be
*very* insidious. So...much...uncertainty. All I could do when I read the results (in my
hotel room in Baltimore) was to clutch at the medallion the valiant Rhonda Gold gave me
(""Be strong and of good courage""), feel the tears stinging in my eyes, and watch the
candles flicker in the little menorah I brought with me from home in order to be able to
obey the commandment to light them.
I'll be able to provide a more detailed medical update after tomorrow's appointments. My
list of questions is at the ready. I am looking forward to seeing Rhonda Cooper, the
chaplain for the Kimmel Cancer Center, tomorrow morning. I contacted her a week or so
ago and will visit with her between my other meetings. My lovely college friend who lives
in Baltimore, David Miranda, will reprise his role as my 'care person' during my infusion.
His presence is calming and comforting. As I'll be pumped full of Benadryl, he'll make
sure I return to my hotel in one piece.
My cancer saga continues to unfold against a backdrop of truly lovely moments; perhaps
I'm simply living out my priorities, as I've often said that if I knew (know??) that my life
span might be shorter than anticipated, I would definitely want to prioritize time with
family and friends. My decision to spend most of November in NY while travelling weekly
to Baltimore was definitely a good one, as I was able to alternate my treatments with
'quality time' in the city. This included a fun tapas lunch at Boqueria Flatiron with my
                       922 / 1.901
college friends Denise and Mike Reiss and Richard Bashner and a heartwarming visit with
one of my dearest friends, Mitchel, on one of his annual visits to the States from France,
where he now lives. Mitchel and I met in a class on Proust when I was a freshman (the
only one in the class!) and he was a sophomore. We became fast friends, in 1980
travelling all over Italy together (I remember wearing a shimmering red/pink-gold colored
jumpsuit while dancing to ""Funkytown"" in a disco in Florence...), then winding up as
around the corner neighbors when he was in law school at NYU and I was at NYU's
Institute of French Studies, also for grad school. Even though we hadn't seen each other
for 2.5 years (the last time was in Paris, on my birthday, when Mitchel, our dear mutual
friend Randy, and I went out to dinner), we immediately started yapping away as if not a
moment had passed. It did me so much good to see him.
At the end of my NY stay, Ben arrived in a rental car and we drove back to PA (I always
value those long car rides as rarely do I get to spend so much uninterrupted time with
my son!). Ben spent the entire week at home, and Sammi arrived a few days later.
Despite how much I loved being back in the city, I appreciated the fresh air, quiet and
calm of my house, and was happy to be able to cook my own meals as well. Ben, Sammi
and I spent several days cooking for our Thanksgiving celebration at Michael and Sue's.
That too was most pleasant, relaxing, celebratory and delicious, from the oysters, scallop
ceviche and Cava served as an appetizer to the tasty pecan and pumpkin pies Ben and
Sammi made (I contributed the crust) for dessert. I seem to be able to experience joy
rather spontaneously these days -- compounding my natural disposition, which I'd say
tends towards joie de vivre. Grateful for that.
The Saturday after Thanksgiving I greatly enjoyed a visit with the wonderful Christi, a
former grad student who has become a cherished friend. We went straight for the 'no
b.s.' convo about survivorship, work, motherhood, families, spirituality and more. And as
always we shared lots of giggles too, especially remembering a rather burlesque
experience (or series of experiences) at a conference in Paris about ten years ago. Got a
peek for Christi's husband, DJ, and her adorable (yet, that day, weary) seven-year-old,
Misha.
I have a new wig (see pictures). The 'Hair Lady' (per the name of her business),
Katherine Fagan, a very nice woman a bit younger than me, knows how to make women
(and men too I suppose) look good and feel attractive. I'm quite happy w/my new look. A
sweet male student (I presume) came up to me in Starbucks the other day and
exclaimed: ""I love your hair!"" [At the farmer's market in NY a week or so ago, when I was
wearing my previous wig, a woman came up to me and said: ""You *must* tell me where
you get your hair cut! It looks terrific.""]. Go figure.
If all goes as planned -- health? Omicron? - I am planning to go to Paris next month, for
two weeks! This plan was hatched over a dinner or two with a group of fabulous women
friends in State College, all of whom work or have worked for the University. One of them
                       923 / 1.901
has been taking French classes and would like to use her newfound language skills,
another vacations fairly regularly there with her husband, a third has never been but has
been eager to go. All of them had suggested that it would be fun to go with me, given
how well I know the city as well as our common love of pretty things, good meals, wine
and conversation, and much more. I invited my friend Helen to join me, Cheryl and
Sandy -- a fab foursome for sure. We (myself, C and S) will be staying in a hotel in the
Marais, and will arrive just as the winter 'soldes' (sales) begin (!). There are a few
exhibits I'm eager to see, including one at the Fondation Louis Vuitton showcasing the
stellar collection of a famous Russian collector. I'm hoping that the second week, and
maybe a bit during the first, I'll be able to spend time with friends (Paris friends: I'll soon
contact you about this, but am being a bit cautious about not 'jinxing' my trip given
everything I've written here). I have not been to Paris since March 2019, right before I
was diagnosed, when I took students there in the context of my course on France and
the Holocaust. I was supposed to return over the summer as a 60th bday present but
was recovering from debulking surgery and so Ben and Sammi went in my stead. I hope
that that scenario won't be repeated this time. Dr. Beavis has no objection and said that
we could shift things around for the two weeks I'm away. I realize that I will likely not be
able to gallivant around Paris with my usual gusto, but I'm prepared to make some
modifications to my usual high-energy schedule. I get excited thinking about the
prospect of returning to my 'happy place.' I even booked a seat, for the first time ever for
me, in business class, ticking off one item on my very short bucket list.

A brief update from Baltimore on today's appointment: after a week of improved sleep
(all sleep meds eliminated in an attempted 'reset'), I slept (for a few hours) miserably
last night, my mind racing and spewing random thoughts, anxious about the following
day's appointments.
Awoke early, Ubured to Dr. Beavis' office for an 8:45 appointment for which she was over
an hour late (good thing my next appointment wasn't until 10:30). A resident who works
with her, though, met with me beforehand and answered many of my questions. I always
feel that my meetings with Dr. Beavis go well, simply because she is so knowledgeable,
talented, compassionate, and capable of answering my questions thoroughly. Once she
is with me, moreover, I have the sense that she is fully *there* and not looking at the
clock or thinking about her next meeting. She sits close to me, fairly casually dressed
(usually a dress from Boden over leggings because she bikes to/from work every day).
She did not seem overly concerned, at this point, about the rise in my CA 125 level. Even
though that level has been trending upwards the past two or three months or so, that
period is marked by the start of my participation in the clinical trial. In other words, she
still thinks that it may take another cycle for the results of this new treatment to be
reflected in the CA 125 number. Further, she noted that the increase has been 11 points
(September to October), then 12 points (October to November). She'd be much more
concerned, she said, if she'd seen a more significant leap in the number (which can top
1000; mine was well into the hundreds initially, if I remember correctly). The scan on
Dec. 27th, as I've mentioned, will be much more conclusive. She encouraged me, again,
to try not to project too far ahead and to be fully in the moment, a goal she encouraged
me, also again, to continue to pursue with my therapist (while she acknowledged its real
difficulty). 
I now have another short 'reprieve' until my scan on the 27th. I look forward to a low-key
few weeks.
I asked her (and have also discussed at length with my therapist) what to make of the
many, many compliments I've been receiving lately on my outward appearance and
affect, while knowing that I am battling incurable advanced metastatic cancer. I've
decided to simply accept these compliments graciously, while privately holding the
knowledge that one can look and feel well and still be fighting an awful disease. My
apparently healthful-looking appearance is not necessarily a 'sign' that I may be winning
the fight. Nevertheless, as Dr. Beavis noted, if I were confronting the final stages of my
disease I would likely 'look sick' (thin, wan, weak etc.). Perhaps I'm simply outwardly
embodying a mantra that my friend Isabelle recently coined: ""Less attitude and more
gratitude""  -- yeah!
                       933 / 1.901
I confirmed with Dr. Beavis that other treatments are still available to me (including,
perhaps, a trial at Sloan) if/when the current one proves unsuccessful. Her response was
unequivocally affirmative. I asked if there were other approaches I could be trying, other
things I could be doing. She responded that the three keys for me remain a)good
sleep/sufficient rest (I *seem* to be rounding a corner on that); b)activity/exercise (need
to work on this; I dislike walking outdoors in cold weather but will push myself to do so);
and c)eating well (no problem there, although I want to rethink my overall plan for
eliminating excess sugars from my diet and privileging healthy foods; it's soup season,
methinks, and fortunately the NYTimes recipe app provides a staggering trove of recipes
for tasty, healthy eats).
Dr. B. also recommended a zinc supplement to ward off the very slight cold I felt I might
be coming down with (but of which she saw no signs in my throat, sinuses, glands etc.).
The gyn-onc resident said (when I asked) that it wouldn't hurt to try acupuncture, and to
continue it if I sensed benefit from it, but that their practice remained neutral regarding
its use.
As a small token of thanks, I gave Dr. Beavis and her nurse, Kelly, a jar of something
good from Tait Farm, my favorite store in State College (sour cherry jam, cranberry
chutney). Kelly gave me one of the first of several warm, tight hugs I received that day,
one of the highlights of my day in fact.
I next walked through the labyrinth of the hospital to Weinberg Building, to say hello to
Rhoda Cooper, the kind, friendly chaplain who had brought me comfort and compassion
after my operations. Rhonda is a warm, outgoing woman of 67, with long hair, whose
offices in the ""Family Services"" section of Weinberg abounds with healing/religious
imagery from various faiths (a menorah, Russian icons, maybe some Buddhist mantras
etc.). We caught up a bit (she remembered that the 60th bday trip to Lyon I had planned
for 2019 with Ben had to be aborted, but that Sammi and Ben were able to go in my
stead; I remembered a transcontinental train trip she was about to take with her
husband, also cancelled due to COVID). I asked her if she would pray with me, and she
crafted the most beautiful prayer (which I wish I had recorded), distilling and weaving
the various strands of our conversation (healing, Ben, my upcoming trip to Paris, my
support team etc.) into a series of wishes addressed to a higher power. A comforting
moment during a hectic and at times stressful day. Grounding.
Here's a YouTube clip featuring Rhonda: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j41GjOi9AFQ
Rhonda walked me to the Viragh Building for treatment. On the way, she introduced me
to Moira Bucciarelli, a second chaplain recently been hired to work with cancer patients.
At Viragh, I was delighted to see Jesse, a 'greeter' who helps patients check in, prints out
their itineraries if needed, provides directions etc. Rhonda told me that he had been a
                       934 / 1.901
van driver at Hopkins for years. A dapper gentleman (he modeled when he was younger,
he told me), Jesse's warm greetings have brightened my chemo days the past month or
so; he seems to understand the vulnerability and anxiety accompanying many visitors to
this clinic. He's so popular that when he has a day off, patients routinely ask: ""Where's
Jesse?"" Jesse's a rock star! This time I remembered to ask for a picture of him, which
Rhonda took. As you'll see in the pic, Jesse embraced me in a welcoming, protective side
hug (he also smelled good!). Rhonda escorted me to the 10th floor for chemo; before we
parted, we also embraced: hugs #2 and 3 for the day!
Chemo proceeded smoothly. The Benadryl really knocks me out (I felt like I was slogging
through quicksand, and my mind was very slow in making connections, articulating
thoughts...). My wonderful friend David took a break from his work to come sit w/me
during chemo and we caught up on our holidays, travel, the challenges of David's new
work project, gender neutral pronouns and much else. At one point I was so tired though
that I had to ask David if he wouldn't mind if I closed my eyes for a few minutes. As soon
as I did, I felt myself drifting towards sleep (I was lying on a hospital bed as all the chemo
rooms with lounge chairs were taken). As soon as I fell asleep, however, Ann, the nurse
affiliated with the clinical trial, stopped by briefly to bring me a new bottle of
Fostamatinib (trial drug that I had been taking along with the chemo but had to stop
when my white blood cells started to decrease) at a new, lower level. I will begin taking
these and will see what happens. Nicole, the chemo nurse assigned to me during my
previous visits, was busy with other patients but stopped by to say hi (can't say enough
good about the Hopkins staff). I finished my treatment in about two hours. David got his
car from the garage next door while I sat outside in the sun on this mild day, then drove
me back to the Residence Inn (I would have enjoyed the fairly short walk, but felt quite
woozy still). He too gave me a warm hug when we parted (hug #4!). He kindly invited
me to stay with him and his husband, Peter, on my next trip to Baltimore (scheduled for
the 30th), a gracious invitation I will strongly consider.
The service at the Residence Inn has declined markedly (new affront this visit: no soap in
the bathroom). However, I will cut the hotel some slack as I surmise that they may be
understaffed. The personnel is resolutely friendly and many of the patients, I presume,
are here for appointments at Hopkins -- people in wheelchairs (young man with a spinal
cord injury?), a man with impressive bandaging over his eye and a large part of his face,
me in my chemo cap. We interact compassionately with one another in the elevator or
the lobby, our tacit understanding of one another's travails buoying us. It's a safe space.
Speaking of kindness and compassion -- shortly after my return to the hotel, my first
cousin David (our mothers are sisters) dropped off dinner for me, heeding my request for
some deli food if possible. His care package will last me throughout the weekend I'm
sure: chicken noodle soup, four large pieces of stuffed cabbage (looks delicious), potato
latkes for Chanukah, and an enormous sandwich with both pastrami and corned beef (I
ate half of it, and some latkes). So kind of my cousin (a lawyer), who is a real mensch
                       935 / 1.901
(and, if she had anything to do with it, his wife Ilene, mother and grandmother
extraordinaire to a large family). Thank you, dear cousins!
I fell immediately into a deep sleep at about 4 p.m. When I awoke at 7 p.m. I thought it
was 7 a.m. the next day and I prepared to wake up, go get a coffee, and hit the road. I
found it strange that I was still in my clothes, hadn't taken off my earrings, and that the
NYTimes Spelling Bee was not featuring a 'clean' puzzle, as it does each day. I finally
realized that Friday had not yet arrived. So I regrouped, watched CNN and had dinner
while writing this journal entry. Hope I can sleep tonight after this long nap!

No more weekly trips to Baltimore for now; those were the condition of my participating
in the clinical trial, during which time I was to be monitored closely by the physicians and
staff at Hopkins. From now until whenever I will no longer participate in the trial (a CT
scan on Dec. 27th will be telling in that regard), I will receive at least two treatments per
cycle here in State College. While I continue to take my Fostamatinib pill twice daily (at a
lower dose than originally, as it was impairing my white blood cell count) -- the pill is the
'extra element' that is the focus of the trial -- I will receive my chemo drug (Taxol) as an
infusion here in State College, in addition to the pre-meds (Benadryl, a steroid, an anti-
nausea med, and something else that I've forgotten).
So this week I was back at Scenery Park for my blood draw (Wednesday), then met with
Dr. Patel on Thursday before treatment. It was so nice to see him; I've really grown quite
fond of him. He reviewed my blood work (nothing warranted treatment being withheld,
thankfully) and, like Dr. Beavis, tried to sway me from fetishizing my CA125 number,
which, as I noted previously, had risen by 11 and then 12 the past two months and
currently stands at 45 (anything above 35-38 being considered outside normal range).
What Dr. Patel asserts is more important to focus on are cancer-related symptoms, of
which fortunately I have very few: no vomiting, extremely minimal nausea (I rarely take
anti-nausea meds), healthy appetite and stable weight, no advance in neuropathy, still
present in my toes but not my fingers, thank goodness, no mouth sores to speak of (I've
had a few, which disappeared quickly with a special mouthwash), stable, normal blood
pressure. The only symptom I still struggle with is diarrhea, but the right dosage of two
anti-diarrhea meds is helping; that dose just needs to be tweaked occasionally. Still, that
niggling CA125 number....has to mean...something...right?
Dr. Patel, like Dr. Beavis, is completely behind my going to Paris next month. He
understands what an important mood lifter it will provide for me, how much I miss my
friends there, how I love that city so, how excited I am to be travelling with three
outstanding women friends. He shared with me how a recent trip to visit friends in Des
Moines, IA, where he used to live, had the same uplifting effect on him. My chemo
schedule can be tweaked to accommodate the two weeks I'll be away. Now crossing my
fingers that nothing (Omicron, my own health) confounds our plan. It will have been 2.5
years since I've been in Paris. I had to cancel my last trip, to celebrate my 60th bday, as I
was recovering from debulking surgery.
Dr. Patel's parting shot to me: ""You're doing well."" Yeah.
My infusion now lasts (only) two hours, one for the pre-meds and one for the chemo. I
was happy to see the wonderful nurses in the infusion room, several of whom I feel close
to, and who are all highly skilled, supportive, friendly and compassionate. One of my
favorite nurses, Brynn, took care of me: although Christian (isn't everyone around
                       939 / 1.901
here?), she's 'conversant' w/Jewish culture (I forget how; there's a reason), asked me
about my Chanukah celebrations, requested (for a second time!) my chicken soup recipe
(which I *will* copy for her, now that I've written it out for Ben, with all my tips). Like
Michael and me, Bynn's parents are amicably divorced and spend holidays together, so
we always catch up on that. She and her wife are raising a little girl, and we trade news
of our kids as well. Several other nurses who I now know fairly well stopped by to say
hello. Somehow it all felt very comforting. I am pumped so full of Benadryl before the
chemo infusion that I conked out immediately, and did so after each minor interruption
to start a new med etc. There is *no way* I could have driven myself home safely after
chemo, so I'm grateful to my friend Jackie for driving me to Scenery Park in the morning
and my friend and neighbor Janis for picking me up, with a pitstop at Meyer's dairy,
where I treated myself to a delicious small butterscotch sundae and promptly left my
credit card in the reader as I was so loopy (I retrieved it today). Conked out again as
soon as I returned home.
My energy today surprised me, given that I had just had chemo the day before (although
one hour v. several makes a difference). I ran lots of errands, then took a 50 mile drive
to buy maple syrup from an Amish farm. Caught up on emails. No nap.

I also wonder at how a highly-driven, consistently motivated professional with a laser-
sharp focus on her career for decades (ie me) can currently feel nearly zilch motivation
to pursue my academic work, while a book review, a book manuscript review and several
other projects await. It actually amazes me. At least two retired colleagues have shared
with me their perception of this post-retirement phase as particularly productive and
fertile for them. I admire them for this, but it's not me. At least not now. I have an
instinct, though, that motivation for academic work will return. At some point.
Things I am motivated to do right now: spend time with family and friends, lots of it.
Cook, especially for other people. Take long drives in the countryside. Write my blog.
Finish up a few (autobiographical) stories I've been working on. Cultivate spirituality.
Fundraise for the Kelly Gyn-onc Service at Hopkins. Find time for the 'little things' I
barely had time for before: concocting creative gifts for people; writing holiday cards;
giving the 'gift of time' (the phrase 'the gift of me' sounds terribly self-aggrandizing...)
Retort: ""You devoted yourself single-mindedly to your successful career for close to thirty-
five years, were a chaired professor at a major research university, wrote three books
(one that obtained a prestigious award, another nominated for two awards in France),
edited a fourth, edited a special issue of a journal and produced many articles, taught
hundreds of students, directed a dozen dissertations (whose authors are all thriving in
their careers) and have a few others en cours, served your department as graduate
director for five years and as department head for two, and went out arguably at the top
of your game. Surely you can rest on your laurels now and turn to other pursuits in
                       940 / 1.901
retirement if you care to? AND you have cancer, for chrissake. Go easy on yourself, girl!""
Me: Yes, cognitively I understand this, but please understand that all these
accomplishments do not diminish the sense of loss or worth or identity I am feeling (the
word 'slothful' also comes to mind...). And it's hard to know what to do about that, as it
makes me feel aimless and frustrated, lacking tangible goals. And I like to have goals.
Imagine how a talented athlete -- or simply anyone used to being active -- feels after a
devastating injury. I can certainly ascribe much of this feeling to the double whammy of
retirement and cancer. And I'm sure COVID fits into the equation somehow. As does, to a
lesser extent, the absence of an identifiable 'reward structure' (via raises and other
forms of symbolic 'legitimation'). I also feel the loss of professional colleagues who had
become friends through common conference attendance over many decades, meet ups
in Paris, collaboration on projects etc. It makes me sad to think that I might lose these
friendships if my conference attendance and other forms of visibility in the professional
realm remain irregular. Or perhaps professional friendships are a different kind of beast?
I became very jazzed watching a Ken Burns documentary about the Bard Prison
Initiative, through which prisoners receive a college-level education (Associate's degree
or BA/BS) with classes taught largely but not exclusively by Bard faculty. This motivated
enough for me to check out the website and see how professors could apply. I've always
been intrigued by teaching in prisons and wonder if this is something I might pursue (but
with weekly chemo treatments?...); I think my course on France and the Holocaust could
be a hit.  The prisoners in this documentary were *extraordinary,* great minds, highly
motivated. I had also envisioned work for the Peace Corps as another exciting post-
retirement possibility. But I may have to adjust my horizons. Or maybe not.
So...much..uncertainty about what I will and will not be able to undertake going forward.
Perhaps it's simply a time to explore the possibilities that radical *freedom* entails:
testing the limits of old and new relationships or imagining new ways of being in them;
making memories; trying out new modes of being, doing, saying. ""Freedom's just
another word for nothing left to lose [?]""
Was delighted to have lunch this week with my ""III Cs,"" our erstwhile OC survivor group
(reinvigorated this week by the presence of a new member, Mitzi, whose company I
enjoyed and who is also treated at both Hopkins and by Dr. Patel in State College). This

                       943 / 1.901
It's been almost two weeks since I've written. Since last Saturday I've been in NY, hoping
to avoid the dreariness and loneliness I often feel in State College around the holidays,
when most everyone clears out. Maria and Greg were heading to the city Saturday for a
brief vacation and our road trip sure beat the long train ride that I had booked myself on.
On Sunday the immediate family, nine of us, enjoyed a wonderful 85th birthday
celebration for my mother, at home, a NY Sunday brunch extraordinaire with all the
fixins' (Absolute bagels, paper thin smoked salmon and sable and various types of
herring from Russ and Daughters, cream cheese spreads and salmon roe and olives and
gherkins and pickled butter beans from Zabar's, and a to-die for chocolate mousse cake
from Veniero's. And Moet :) We continued our quinquennial tradition of asking my
mother questions (from the matter of fact, ""Tell us about your ideal New York day,"" to
the existential: ""Do you have any life lessons for us?""). Throughout the many hours we
spent together, toasts were offered, presents given (mine was a photo collage put
together by a local framing place, reaching back to capture my mother at a sweet 16
party and then forward to the present), photos taken.
Perhaps because of the feasting on Sunday -- but who knows? - I've been feeling off
since then, with an upset stomach compounded by fatigue. So I've needed to rest a lot,
which is what I suppose my body is calling for. Consequently, I feel somewhat weak and
get easily winded walking a few blocks. I've been in touch with Justin, my superb nurse
at JH (ie I emailed him to let him know what's up and he called me *five minutes* after
that), who has made some suggestions (reduce anti-diarrheal meds) and wants me to
keep in touch with him.
Admittedly, the anxiety of potentially needing to go to the ER or Med Expres (which I'm
not anticipating at this point) in the midst of the resurgent plague adds to my stress. It is
a very strange, muted time and everyone seems slightly depressed. I hear about more
friends/acquaintances with COVID every day. The city seems quieter than usual, but for
the swelling lines of people waiting to get tested. Nearly everyone is adjusting holiday
plans. How long will it be possible to hold out before the virus invades our homes and
those of our loved ones, as well?
Until Monday of this week, though, I felt on course. My latest infusion, in State College,
proceeded smoothly -- once it started. Because I had taken a COVID test in light of my
upcoming travel (all nine of us agreed to do this before gathering on Sunday), and
because this was noted on my Geisinger chart, Dr. Patel's office did not want to proceed
with my chemo until the results (negative, in the end) came in, for fear that I might
transmit the virus to other cancer patients in the infusion room. I had to explain that I
was completely asymptomatic and was taking a test as a precaution before I was
allowed to proceed with chemo. I also did not know that I needed a magnesium drip that
                       944 / 1.901
day, which added two hours to my treatment. In the end everything worked out fine, and
I actually felt relatively energetic the first two days post-chemo. I believe, though, that
the amount of chemo meds progressively accruing in my system is starting to wear me
down -- at least that's how it seems to me. 
Thanks to my neighbor/friend Janis and my friend Monique for transporting me to/from
chemo. I was super loopy from Benadryl, but I believe that Monique and I stopped at
Meyer Dairy after my chemo so that I could indulge in a mini-butterscotch sundae.
I'll return to State College on Saturday (Xmas) on the Megabus. I reserved both my own
seat and the one next to mine as a kind of 'buffer' (this is a 'thing' one can now do on the
Megabus), and in the hopes that the bus will be well-ventilated. My
pelvic/abdominal/chest scan is scheduled for Monday; I'm anxious. When I'm sitting I feel
some pressure on my pelvis where I know tumors are located (ie at the top of the
vagina). Uncomfortable. Then I need to go to Baltimore on the 30th for treatment and to
be examined by one of the doctors (Dr. Beavis will be on vacation in CA). I am hoping to
be able to drive as long as the weather cooperates; if not, I'm not entirely sure what I'll
do -- perhaps see if the reliable driver I've used before, Mohindr Singh, is still available
for this type of (costly...) work. I liked it when his wife accompanied him and she shared
her recipes for Indian rice pudding and other treats. I need to contact my friend David
Miranda who nicely offered to put me up in Baltimore (I'll need to stay both the 29th and
the 30th). I may, then, wind up driving back to State College on the 31st, which seems as
forlorn as my upcoming Christmas Day Megabus ride. I'll need to try to shift this
paradigm a bit in order to not get swallowed up in bleakness. Of course, an encouraging
scan result would compensate for a lot!
In better news, I've been sleeping amply and soundly. And I did savor some alone time in
the city with Ben, Ethan and my photographer friend Laurent (w/whom I discussed ideas
for a portrait of me that I'm hoping to commission from him, with a vanitas theme).

This is a good news, bad news tale. I'll start with the good, or at least better, news. Given
how tired and generally unwell I've felt recently, I had convinced myself beyond a
reasonable doubt that my recent scan (which itself went smoothly; the technicians at
Geisinger Gray's Woods are very pleasant and know me by now) would show
progression, as my last one had. The radiologists' reports (from both Geisinger and
Hopkins) sat in my message queue in my portal for a day or two, sending my anxiety
through the roof. The combination of technical medical language and the possibility of
receiving devastating news (eg spread to other organs etc.) kept me paralyzed, frozen.
So I was grateful when Dr. Beavis called me, as I was in my car in the parking lot at
Scenery Park about to have my bloodwork done, to discuss the results. 'Grateful' does
not actually describe the tears that welled up when she called because a)I thought she
was in California for vacation and didn't expect to hear from her and b)I was having an
awful day (more on that awful day in the 'bad news' part of the story). The good news,
then, is that my scan shows that my cancer is 'stable.' The existing tumors have
remained more or less the same size as before. A good number of cancerous lymph
nodes have *decreased* in size. There are some 'non-specific' spots on my lung(s?), but
at this point we don't know what they are; it could be cancer or perhaps something
completely different. There is no new cancer in liver, bones, other organs. I will continue
with the trial and will be scanned again in eight weeks -- an eight week reprieve, then,
from having my mortality in my face constantly. Fifty-six days, each a blessing. The
result also makes me place some hope in the clinical trial; we'll see if these results can
be sustained. Yes, this was not the *best possible result,* i.e. regression of the cancer,
but it is not progression. Holding steady. And that's a good thing. The 'cherry on top' is
that my CA level dropped from last month's 45 to this month's 35, back into normal
range. Yay.
The bad news is that I spent Tuesday night in the ER. 'Bad' not because there is anything
seriously wrong, beyond my cancer, but simply because a night spent in Covid Central
was traumatizing. In fact, I think Centre County set a record that day for the number of
Covid cases. [By the way, my friend David will perhaps feel slightly less badly about  not
being able to host me in Baltimore this week -- although I know he'll feel badly for what
happened to me instead -- as he and his husband were exhibiting Covid symptoms;
David, I did shift my hotel reservation until next week!]
                       952 / 1.901
As I write this, I'm unsure of what I want from you. Perhaps some sympathy (but never
pity). Perhaps I simply want a record of what happened, as for much of this journal. I do
feel some urge to embellish, to sink my writerly chops into descriptions of a hellscape.
More challenging to convey the emotions I felt, the sad thoughts that took hold of my
mind, and the extent to which I hate being in the hospital as it reinforces my sense of
illness. The hours spent staring into space like a zombie. The crying jags. The broken and
lost feeling. I try to be  tough (""Be strong and of good courage"") but after a multi-hour
wait for a room (five hours? six? seven? eight? I lost track), my nerves felt frayed.
I do want to assert categorically that the staff at Mount Nittany Medical Center took good
care of me. They are doing the best they can while totally overwhelmed (one doctor said
to me: ""It's a crisis."").  I was impressed with the two doctors who tended to me. This
being said, I never got out of the ER into the hospital (simply no beds in the hospital so
an ER room became my de facto hospital room). In some ways I think this was a blessing
as ER nurses are unflappable. It's just another day of crazy for them.
I had been spiking some fevers and feeling generally unwell so Dr. Beavis recommended
I go to the ER (she feared that suppression of my white blood cells was causing a fever,
which can be quite serious). Truth be told, though, I am not completely certain my
thermometers were giving accurate readings as they were reporting astronomically high
temperatures. Both at Dr. Patel's office (where I stopped by to have my temperature
read by a nurse) and in the hospital, my temps were more or less in the normal range, a
bit high. So I sheepishly feel that my rush to the hospital may have been cloaked in a
false premise. What is undeniable, though, is that I needed what I call a 'tune up.' The
chemo destroys so much good stuff along with the cancer cells that I can get very run
down, which I think explains why I wasn't feeling great part of the time in NY, very
fatigued, very winded. In the ER, then, I received a blood transfusion; a three-bag
magnesium drip; extra potassium; antibiotics in case of infection; chest X-ray,
bloodwork, blood cultures etc. I was also swabbed for COVID and am relieved to report
that I DON'T have it.
The waiting room was the hellscape; the first image above (or below?) came to mind
immediately: Michelangelo, ""The Despair of the Damned."" Absolutely packed to the gills,
people coughing, lots of sick kids, no sense at all of when I would be called. As most of
the Covid patients at MNMC are unvaccinated, I presume that many in the waiting room
were too. The lights are dim and the walls an icky dull green-gray color. To complete the
ghoulish tableau, several manacled prisoners in orange jumpsuits, closely guarded,
marched in, ankle chains jangling (I can only presume that COVID is running rampant in
prisons, although these guys may well have been here for some other reason). Marley's
ghost came to mind, here to warn us of....what? Once I saw the triage nurse for five
minutes, after several hours, I was sent to another de facto waiting room, also
completely full, to wait for a room in the ER to open up (conversation between a man
                       953 / 1.901
and woman across from me: ""I've been waiting six hours."" ""I've been waiting eight.""). Oy.
After several hours (?) and a brief screening with a doctor (very nice; impressive), a
room in the ER opened up. Thankfully, I only had to spend one night there. To all my
peeps: please avoid the ER/hospital at all costs if you can!
Thank you, Helen, for dropping off a chocolate milkshake for me just as I told the nurse
that I had a hunger headache (dinner Tuesday night: chips and a candy bar). Thanks,
Jackie, for all your concern, good humor, kindness, grocery shopping etc. And Maria,
thanks for picking me up! Thanks, Julie, for texting. And gratitude to my family of course.
If you contacted me and I didn't mention you here, my apologies. I was really strung out
and may have some selective amnesia regarding my hospital stay.
I look forward to a calmer 2022. I had a feeling 2021 would not go gently.
I look forward to renewing my commitment to my wellness.
I will try to write again tomorrow.
As my friend Isabelle recently said to me, I think 'pivot' is *the* word for 2021. And if it
isn't it should be.

238,"2021/2022: my third new year since my diagnosis in Spring 2019. In some
                       956 / 1.901
ways, that fact amazes me. I attribute my survival to medical and scientific
advances (parp inhibitors; clinical trials) deployed by a stellar medical team
in Baltimore and State College; the consistent, loving support of family and
friends near and far; and, I suppose, my own tenacity.
In early post-diagnosis conversations with Rabbi Ostrich, he and I agreed
that, although cancer is by no means a ""blessing"" (as some would have it),
it might offer me the possibility of learning a thing or two. This I have, about
friendship for example (or perhaps about an area  between 'friendship' and
'love'), mainly because others have modeled it for me time after time. I
thought about this when reading a quote from the recently-deceased
Archbishop Desmond Tutu (a personal hero): ""Your ordinary acts of love and
hope point to the extraordinary promise that every human life is of
inestimable value."" ""Ordinary acts of love"" (so powerful, so precious) have
been manifested to me countless times during my cancer journey, in turn
leading me to learn more about gratitude. I'm sure I've gleaned other
lessons too, for example about my own unexpected toughness, but these
are a few of the main take-aways.
In a low moment, my brother, I believe, instructed me to ""think happy
thoughts."" This prompted me to return to some of my most memorable New
Year's Eves: ""I have more memories than if I'd lived a thousand years,""
writes Baudelaire in ""Spleen,"" comparing his memory chambers to a ""heavy
chest of drawers cluttered with balance-sheets,/Processes, love-letters, verses, ballads,/And
heavy locks of hair enveloped in receipts."" Herewith, then, some of my mental clutter:
1981, Vienna: Because why *wouldn't* one spontaneously book a train trip to Vienna from
Paris for the last week of the year, imagining that the city must look fairytale enchanting at this
time of year? No matter that one does not speak German, has never been to Austria, is travelling
alone. Woke up in my couchette to thrilling views of the snow-covered Alps; the dining car had
linen table cloths and I warmed myself with gulashsuppe.  While I was dutifully photographing
a church in a quaint square the day after my arrival, M., a medical student my age who had been
contemplating me through his bedroom window, became intrigued, and left his apartment to
find out more. We spent the whole week together. I don't think we slept much. The week
culminated on New Year's Eve at a large club, Kulisse, packed with young people, where at
midnight we danced to waltzes by Strauss! I felt like I was floating on air (yes, I felt every inch
this timeworn cliché!). I was twenty-two and having the time of my life! (Cue Frank Sinatra:
                       957 / 1.901
""When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year..."")
1984, Paris: New Year's Eve dinner at a swanky 'floating restaurant' on the Seine, l'Ile de
Kachmir. A Franco-American affair with about a dozen of us, Vinni, Doris, Rosalie and I, some
of our new French friends met in our classes at Sciences Po, and friends/partners of those
friends. I see from the photos that we are dressed festively (although I'm not in any of the
photos), the food as I recall was excellent, the Eiffel Tower glittered for the réveillon. My date
book reminded me that Vinni and I had just returned that day from a week's vacation in London,
where we had been theatre-goers, museum hoppers, sale shoppers (Selfridge's), and tea
drinkers. We had also met for tea with the head of our program at NYU, Nicholas Wahl, whose
British girlfriend's son just happened to be the future prime minister, Boris Johnson! Vinni also
reminded me, just yesterday, that the meal made a sizeable dent in our grad student finances,
despite the very strong American dollar of the mid-1980s (one thing to thank Ronald Reagan
for, I suppose). I was twenty-five years old and having the time of my life!
1985, Madrid: I wish I had a picture of this epic evening, the culmination of a week Vinni and I
spent in Madrid, mainly in the company of a friend of a friend of hers, a delightful guy named
Philip, half-British half-Spanish, who lived in Madrid and reveled in the Madrileno lifestyle that
we, consequently, adopted for a week as well: dinner at ten (he took us to wonderful restaurants
and tapas joints), hit the bars around midnight (always packed, lively), sleep late, a museum or
two in the afternoon. Philip was smart and I have recollections of a week's worth of intense, non-
stop conversation. On New Year's Eve Vinni and I were to first swing by Phillip's apartment:
this is where the now legendary part of the story -- since then recounted many times to our sons
-- about the two of us wandering cluelessly around a bullfighting ring on a freezing December
night, comes in. There were no cell phones, of course, I don't even think we had a map but
eventually we found P's place. We wound up at a smallish yet packed *French* restaurant, in
full NYE's mode: great food and drink, over the top conviviality, waiters partying with the
patrons (or perhaps I embellish here?), silly hats and noisemakers at midnight. Vinni may be
able to add more details. I was twenty-six and having the time of my life!
Between 1988 and 1993 (?), Pittsburgh: Before there were mortgages, before there was tenure,
before there were kids, before Michael and I were even married (I think?), we spent a New
Years in Pittsburgh with our dear friends Michael and Paula, with whom we celebrated many
holidays and milestones, always over excellent food and drink. We had dinner at a small
restaurant that someone must have known about (unfortunately, I did not record the name in my
datebook, but perhaps Paula remembers). Everyone teased me because I was adamant about
                       958 / 1.901
getting back to our borrowed apartment to see the ball drop in Times Square. In the taxi there,
in a mood of mild hilarity (and closely eyeing the clock as midnight approached), someone
(me?) asked the cabbie what was the strangest or most memorable thing anyone had ever done
in his cab. He replied (if I'm not mistaken), ""Took a [xxx]."" New Year's Day, on our way back
to State College, we received a speeding ticket in a town called Gallitzen, PA (pop. 1500). I
think Michael was driving. I was in my early thirties and loved our couples' adventure in
Pittsburgh.
2011, State College: First Night in State College -- ice sculptures, a drink at Zola, a concert by a
folk duo in a church -- followed by late-night dinner at home (pasta and scallops in lemon
cream sauce, and champagne) with D. A romantic grown-up evening, far from the slightly
unregulated hijinks of my twenties. D. was a bit of an old soul, so Donny Hathaway fit the
mood of the evening. I was 52 and enjoying a wonderful evening.
2018, Paris: At my bff Randy's studio, with an acquaintance of his (a bit of a wise-ass, who
enjoyed being gratuitously provocative). Randy cooked a delicious stuffed guinea hen (pintade)
from Picard along with some other dishes; I brought champagne and some pâté (?). That night
the guys introduced me to the British comedy series ""Little Britain"" (""Computer says no""),
which I found uproariously funny. We laughed uncontrollably most of the evening. I was 59
and appreciated the laughter and camaraderie.
Many other new year's eves were spent in New York, Washington, D.C., France, or State
College -- content or depressed or sick or festive or some/none of the above. Sometimes solo,
sometimes with others, sometimes at long-gone local restaurants (The Governor's Table in
Bellefonte). On Y2K, we stayed up until midnight to make sure the earth wouldn't explode; five-
year old Ben made it until midnight! Another year, we navigated First Night and big snowdrifts
with a stroller in freezing weather. 
This year's festivities were lovely: a friend invited me to a small gathering on the early side at
her home, along with five other folks (all vaccinated). I had just been discharged from the ER
the day before and was eager to put that traumatizing experience behind me and ditch my yoga
pants for a pretty skirt from Anne-Elisabeth.  Over a delicious meal (fondue and a variety of
veggie dishes c/o NYTimes), we laughed heartily about a stinkbug circling the dining table,
several glasses of spilled champagne (or 'mock' champagne) and poppers that wouldn't pop. The
perfect gathering for me this year. I had a great time.
Grateful for the all of it.
                       959 / 1.901
Wishing you good health, happiness, success (however you define or
measure it) and tranquility in 2022.

239,"I'm back from my monthly trip to Baltimore, with Ben in tow. I should say, rather, that
Ben (with some minor grumbling that I found perfectly understandable given the ask!)
kindly agreed to meet me in Baltimore yesterday afternoon (he traveled by train from
NY), stay overnight in my hotel (Residence Inn Johns Hopkins) and drive me home today,
staying over here in State College until he returns to Brooklyn via Megabus tomorrow.
This was a very big boost to me psychologically and emotionally as I didn't feel like I had
to take on singlehandedly the myriad details involved in my trip and multiple Hopkins
visits. Although he didn't accompany me to the Medical Center itself (which was fine), it
felt great to see him when he picked me up after chemo!
Earlier in the week, I had met with my PCP (Primary Care Physician), Paul Damaske, a
very sweet, relentlessly upbeat person and good, youngish  doctor who always has
worthwhile suggestions about my general care despite not being as specialized as Drs.
Beavis and Patel. He reminded me that when I was first diagnosed, prior to any surgery,
treatment regimen etc.,  we were completely in the dark about my future, prognosis etc.
and he seemed quite enthusiastic about seeing me doing generally well going on three
years. He asked if he could give me a hug at the end of our visit, and I consented, an act
of ""ordinary goodness"" that felt quite caring and confirming!
I also met (virtually) with my therapist on Tuesday and she remarked (in the course of
conversation) that I seemed to have a much sounder sense and broader knowledge
about my medical condition now than I did at the outset -- which is true. I guess that
knowledge has empowered me to some extent in coping with the entirety of my
situation.
My drive down to Baltimore was smooth. Where is everybody? My go-to pit stop location
in Harrisburg, Alvaro's Bread & Pastry Shop, was closed for winter holiday (these folk
work hard and they deserve a break!), so I stopped instead at a funky coffee shop a few
blocks away, Little Amps, for a breakfast burrito, fuel for the second half of the trip. As I
arrived a day early for my appointments (stopping first at a bakery in Little Italy,
Vaccaro's), I took a rest, wrote some emails and texts, relaxed etc. As mentioned, the
service at this hotel has declined: there were no sheets or any type of bedding for Ben's
bed; requests for toilet paper needed to be reiterated three times; and the food on the
limited menu is nearly inedible (I don't say this lightly: hamburger, which I consider a
'safe' item, was very greasy with raw meat, not medium rare as requested; fries needed
to be reordered as very soggy; salad was ok!). I do return, though, because of proximity
                       967 / 1.901
to Hopkins Medical Center (walking distance if I choose); *very* nice staff a large part of
whose clientele is comprised of Hopkins patients (surrounded by folks in wheelchairs,
others with imposing eye patches covering half their face etc., my chemo cap passes
scarcely without notice in what feels like an extremely safe space for me); and high
tolerance (and indulgence) for some 'slippage' in these hard times, when many in the
hospitality sector are leaving their jobs.
Slept so-so, arrived at the dining room a bit too late for breakfast but a very sweet
employee was able to bring me some yogurts and a banana, which I supplemented with
a cappuccino and o.j. from the Starbuck's around the corner. Watched some coverage of
the one-year anniversary of the 6 January events (about which Ben and I listened to an
excellent three-part podcast [""The Daily""] on our return drive).
My appointments went smoothly. Justin met me at Dr. Beavis' office and had me sign a
second consent form for the clinical trial, clearly explaining each section. He is so kind,
thorough, skilled and caring, answering my email queries immediately and calling me
when I was in the ER in State College to see how I was feeling. He suggested that I
increase my daily magnesium dose as my level is low, and chronically low levels can lead
to heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure. I know the low level contributes to the
searing leg cramps that often incapacitate me temporarily during the night.
I am so grateful for my medical team.
Dr. Beavis was running late but as usual I had her full attention once she got to me
(Justin also attended the appointment). She examined me briefly and I brought up all my
concerns, new and less new, to her. Among the newer concerns: recent headaches
(although really none today). We'll wait a week and if they continue; if they do, she'll
order a brain scan. She does not think it sounds like anything to worry about, and I
concur - although the prospect of a brain scan seems scary. I have no other brain tumor
related symptoms (sharp pains, seizures, etc.). Conversely, I know that a)my new,
stronger glasses can't arrive soon enough; b)I spend more time than I should staring at
small screens; c)I've been having nosebleeds and experiencing sinus pressure recently,
likely in part due to dryness in my home. Among the list of potential medical problems I
worry about, this one is actually quite far down on my list -- for now at least, as cancer
cells can certainly travel from the belly to the brain.
Also, Dr. Beavis confirmed that it's fine to drink the copious amounts of carbonated
water that I enjoy -- it's a good way to hydrate, just need to have my dentist check me
twice a year for any damage from the carbonation (a low risk). She further did not
dismiss Dr. Damaske's (PCP's) suggestion (which I found odd) that a stimulant such as
Ritalin or Adderall, usually used to treat ADHD, could boost my energy level. We talked
about Covid, what to do if I get it. Answer: call her, situation and protocols are evolving
rapidly. Hopkins now features a separate ward devoted to cancer patients w/Covid. On
                       968 / 1.901
the list of medical problems I worry about, this one is high up. A good visit, during which
we also discovered our mutual taste for pickled foods! She said: ""You're doing great.""
Treatment went smoothly. I received a bag of magnesium along with my chemo (a lower
dose now, because of my low red/white blood cell count). As usual, the Benadryl made
me super groggy and I dozed a bit. Once in the Viragh Building for chemo, I was happy to
see Jesse, the lovely 'concierge' who helps me at the front desk, and whose smile,
dapper dress, kind words and practical help (eg checking me in, calling the elevator for
me and pressing my floor button etc.) brighten all my treatment visits!
Ben nicely picked me up in my car after chemo and we headed to La Scala, a wonderful
place in Little Italy. We had ordered some pasta and a grilled Caesar salad, quite
delicious. My appetite rarely seems to have deserted me, and I've gained back nearly all
the weight I lost in the past 2.5 years (30 pounds, at which point I looked scrawny and a
bit 'caved in'). I'm still fine, normal, and I don't fret a lot about this, but I need to
continue to eat healthily and not use my illness as an excuse to go overboard (as I did
when I was pregnant  (although not an illness, of course!): nightly steamed whole milk
with sweet almond or vanilla syrup>70 pound weight gain). In any event, we enjoyed our
dinner back in the hotel.
Today I feel better than I have in a long time! I slept well, not waking up once during the
night (highly unusual for me). The lower chemo dose obviously helped as did the extra
magnesium. And Ben's presence was certainly a balm. He went out to get me coffee and
picked up some yogurts for me from the dining room. We were on the road before 10
a.m. It had snowed in Baltimore last night so the attendant needed to dislodge quite a bit
of snow from our front and rear windows, but once on the road the highway and main
roads were clear and the trip home easy.
This week I'll have blood drawn Monday (magnesium) and Tuesday (CBC), then have
chemo here on Thursday.
Michael nicely brought over some seafood chowder Sue had made, in case we didn't
have food at home (I had bought a good-looking piece of fresh salmon from Maine Bay &
Berry, but it will remain in the freezer) -- thoughtful and helpful of them. I picked up a
large, crusty sourdough bread from a relatively new baker in town whom I've heard good
things about (Bellefonte Bread Baker) and I'll put together a simple salad. It's very cold
outside (I'm not a winter fan), so we'll spend a cozy evening indoors.
I forgot to add: my friends and I are postponing our Paris trip. It is not the right time to
go. Friends in Paris are even discouraging me from visiting, given the recent Covid surge
and all the new restrictions in place (all laudable, but they are a disincentive to
vacationers).  Three of us have underlying conditions and of course our health is a
concern. I'm certainly disappointed but also somewhat relieved. We will reschedule for
                       969 / 1.901
after this surge has - hopefully - passed and we can enjoy some of our planned
activities.  I spent literally hours on the phone with United to get credit for my flight,
which I can use for up to a year (this after spending literally hours on the phone with my
insurance company, but that's another story). So a Paris trip will be something to look
forward to within the next year. Strange times indeed.

                       973 / 1.901
Everything went smoothly with this week's chemo. My bloodwork this week apparently
showed good results: my magnesium level is up (we doubled the number of slow-mag
tablets from four to eight daily; I'm also trying to eat magnesium rich foods such as
avocados; consequently, no searing leg cramps during the night, thank goodness); my
hemoglobin level is also up (for which I credit in part the transfusion in the ER; there is
currently a blood shortage, so *please give this life-giving/sustaining fluid if you can!*).
I've been *trying* to maintain a healthy/healthier diet, accompanied by new resolutions
to take advantage of curbside pickup at Wegman's (ie someone else does the shopping
for me; grocery shopping is actually an activity I enjoy, especially during farmers market
season, but for now this is a time and energy saver) and to make a large quantity of a
soup or other healthy dish a week (last week's choice was Harira, a soup eaten all over
the Middle East with healthy doses of harissa paste [pic included]; this week I may opt
for minestrone).
The promising blood results gave me the all-clear for chemo. Since I'm now having
chemo once a week at a lower dose, the session lasts two hours, one for pre-meds
(Benadryl that, when delivered through my vein, knocks me out immediately; Zofran and
some other drugs), the other for Taxol. Thank you, Helen, for driving me to chemo (and
for delivering soup, an almond croissant, and some NK95 masks for me later) and Jackie,
for picking me up, taking me to Pump Station drive-through for coffee and Meyer's for a
butterscotch ice-cream sundae!! It was great to see both of you and catch up in person,
however briefly. Darn Covid... As usual, I felt pretty peppy the rest of Thursday but tired
today and likely through the weekend, when a big snow-storm is predicted.
Because I told Dr. Beavis that I had been having headaches recently -- daily headaches,
every morning, unlike my usual (infrequent) type of headaches (these can hit in the back
of my head, and also upon exertion, with some nausea, although they remain quite well-
controlled throughout the day with Tylenol while still remaining very low-grade the whole
day) -- she ordered an MRI. I was able to move it up from next Saturday to next Tuesday,
but will be at the Lewistown Hospital (about 25 miles from here, over ""Seven
Mountains""). My unfailingly kind friend Martina offered to take me and bring me back
and I'm indebted to her for this; we'll also have a chance to catch up and have a few
giggles along the way. Friends have suggested various roots causes: stress? sinus woes
(it's dry here, and my nose is quite bloodied, chronically, despite regular squirts of saline
spray)?; eye strain (small screens...)?; Covid (I'm asymptomatic aside from fatigue
attributable to cancer, but this is another reason why I'll test)""; all the meds?
My brain's my thing. Without a fully functioning one, or one invaded by sneaky cancer
cells (in her sometimes chipper way, Dr. Beavis confirmed that cancer cells can easily
travel from the belly to the brain), what/who am I (cue frantic, spiraling thoughts here
about my mortality)? ""Je pense, donc je suis,"" and all that, but my professional life and
                       974 / 1.901
identity are predicated on having a pretty good one (brain, that is). So please have a
good thought for me on Tuesday the 18th though about 12:30 [Denis, I will contact you
to rearrange our Zoom meeting, as I was lucky enough to be able to move this scan up
from the 22nd to the 18th]. Meanwhile: stay in the moment, breathe (am thinking about
taking a six-session online meditation course with a local instructor, beginning this
Monday evening), think about the agency I still *do* have as long as I'm here. And I'll
know more next week. Am not really experiencing any other symptoms of brain tumors
(searing, radiating pains, confusion, weakness on one side of the body, personality
changes>am still able to get to Genius most days in the NYTimes Spelling Bee - and to
write this blog...) so hopefully....it's....not that?
I am sending a mi shebeirach this evening tp my college classmate, Brenda Russell,
whom I only met post-graduation (through another classmate, Brenda Prescott) - I wish I
had known both these women better in college, but that's another matter. Like me,
Brenda has OC, stage 4. She texted me last night as she's going back into the hospital
for the chronic vomiting that put her there once before. This time, because of Covid, she
can't have visitors. I know what a difference that can make, emotionally and
psychologically. She asked me to direct prayers in her direction, and I will (as well as to
my cousin, June, and a few others challenged by illness and/or caregiving duties right
now).
Random stuff: am reading _Cloud Cuckoo Land,_ the new novel by Thomas Doerr (whose
_All the Light You Cannot See_ I think I preferred); watched _The Power of the Dog,_ Jane
Campion's new film, with Ben last week and needed to read a few good reviews to
explain the ending to me. Looking forward to Zooming with my NYU grad school besties
in MA, NJ, NY and Paris this Sunday. Covid is making my world smaller right now,
unfortunately, but at least email, Zoom and social media provide ways of staying in
touch. Strange times.

She hears/sees all of your heartfelt calls, texts and messages, but is unable to respond to
them at the moment (she is also without her computer).
Without sounding overly dramatic, and frightening, Willa was “life flighted - aka, flown by
helicopter” yesterday from PA to John’s Hopkins, after a scan revealed a spread or new
growth in the “back of her brain”.
Done more out of an abundance of caution, JH wanted to be able to reduce her swelling
through steroids, alleviate her headaches/nausea/symptoms, and be in position to
perform surgery in the coming days.
She is comfortable, alert, chatty, but understandably concerned about the unknown. 
She was able to see Dr. Beavis shortly after her arrival last night. Soon-after, Dr Beavis
generously spent some time on the phone with me as well.
I will try and answer any additional questions you might have, but I too have been trying

I thought it might be helpful for people to hear from me directly, for some reassurance.
Writing on my tiny phone screen so might take a while.
Yesterday, my angel, Martina, the dear friend who spent most of Monday and Tuesday
with me, in State College and in the ER at the Geisinger Hospital in Lewistown, PA, joked
about the big guy next to us who kept farting as we recalled a memorable performance
of a few summers ago, when moving in a very densely packed area together at our
summer Arts Fest, a big guy let some huge ones rip, sending the crowd scattering,
everyone looking vaguely horrified, aghast, staring accusingly at one another. We
giggled over this and decided we needed to talk about how we were raised around this
issue, out in the open so to speak. And yes, until I was shoved into a helicopter, strapped
into a gurney, and taken to Hopkins - an adventure into itself that afforded an
unparalleled aerial view of ‘Baltimore by Night’ -we laughed about my driving around for
several days recently with a big jar of pickles to locate someone to open- one of the few
foods I could stomach.
Then ex-hubby Michael and I made brain jokes until that got old. He’s definitely in my
support camp (and Ben’s) - we always did well with coparenting of our nifty left
brain/right brain young man, just back from vacay in Mexico w Sammi, gearing up for
last semester MS program in Data Science at NYU, and buying fish I’ve never heard of at
the Brooklyn Food Coop to cook into some yummy fish curry.
God, let me be allowed a little humor, and some potty-mouthed regression pre-brain
surgery as a coping mechanism. Laughter makes my soul feel better. Love to all.❤️

243,"Gas, is a hard act to follow, butt I will try. For those possibly needing some levity, I’ve
attached an amusing clip (imho) from Mel Brooks’ Blazing Saddles.
I just had a long call from Willa, who asked that I provide a medical update. She had a
sonogram today of her arms and legs to detect any clotting. Results are still pending.
In the meantime, she is taking the blood thinner Heparin, and a cocktail of other
medicines to alleviate head distress et al. Her head pain is much better, mostly
uncomfortable when she exerts or strains herself. 
While she was out for the sonogram, Justin, from Dr Beavis’ team, came by to see her.
Although she missed him (a note though was left), one of Willa’s favorite JH spiritual
advisors (chaplain), The Rev. Rhonda S. Cooper, came for a visit.
A Neurosurgeon/team has not stopped by at this point, but Willa was hopeful for this
afternoon. 
Hence, a date has still not been set for surgery. Unforeseen circumstances or a downturn
would be the only reason for it to occur before the weekend, which is unlikely.
Stay tuned!
Despite Covid, and a slightly reduced staff, she is still receiving superb care and
attention.
                       984 / 1.901
We’re putting in place the team (family member), that will be on the ground and with her
at the hospital, pre and post-op. Unfortunately, only I person is allowed.
Your dings are not going un-noticed. Willa is thrilled to have the support and will reach
out to you when she is able.

244,"I will try to provide an update. I feel gratified, humbled, flattered by the many texts and
emails I have received. My apologies for not being able to respond to each one
individually; I simply don't have the bandwidth. Know that your thoughts and caring and
concern and well wishes and acts of kindness and love mean the world to me. But I likely
can't respond for a while. I will be 'going away' for a while -- post-op, to where I'm not
sure but there will be some process of working on coordination and I don't know what I'll
be able to do, to take care of. In the meantime, please don't abandon or forget me! I'll be
back!
All opinions and wishes are converging on a surgical option for me, perhaps next
Wednesday. I have a largeish mass (5 cm?) in my cerebellum, at the base of my skull
and perhaps some other stray lesions that need to be dinged out with a gamma knife.
This will be followed by radiation (hopefully in State College). Going straight to radiation
is not an option for me: my tumor is too large. I wouldn't make it past a few months.
Surgery makes sense from all points of view: my overall life expectancy, overall good
health, wishes and desires, including strong desire to be here.  But of course it's risky
(my surgery day is described as 'the riskiest day of my life') because we are entering
ground zero for everything that controls my life, identity and actions. I could have a brain
bleed, and there are many other complications that can ensue. Fortunately, sonograms
reveal no blood clots (common in cancer) that could complicate blood flow, and I'm on an
anticoagulant (Heparin) to replace Eliquis and that will leave my body in a few days.
Dr. Beavis, who is coordinating things and who has been wonderful, counsels surgery. So
does the neuro team of course. From watching videos, it seems that neurosurgery was
pioneered here at Hopkins w/Harvey Cushing (early 20th c.). The brain surgeons are a
different breed -- and they're allowed to be -- all male, supremely confident, not warm
and fuzzy but fantastic doctors. The one I met and spoke with for about an hour, Dr.
                       987 / 1.901
Christopher Jackson, is of this breed - southern accent, young guy, tall and broad
shouldered, courteous, hair parted neatly to one side, deliberate in his delivery. He was
completely a straight shooter with me, which I appreciated, offering me his services next
W (I am on his schedule, as he had a cancellation), but also those of men ""with more
grey hairs"" should I want. So it is possible that one of the 'higher ups' with more
experience may do the job, if their schedules jive with my time slot for next W. If not, Dr.
Jackson will perform; I don't need to like him tons (as I do Dr. Beavis); he only has to do
good work. He was trained at Hopkins and has many awards and accolades to his name.
It seems that things were a bit touch and go as I was 'life flighted' down to Hopkins
Tuesday night. Pressure was building in my skull, which is why I was having searing
headaches every morning, throughout the day and on exertion, for several weeks. And
they were getting worse. The tumor may have been building for a while, but I've only
recently become symptomatic. The brain MRI at Geisinger in Lewistown on Tuesday
revealed the mets (their ER was great, by the way). My friend David Rothman has written
eloquently and much more technically about this elsewhere, as he's been down this road
before... and is a solace to me right now.
Until surgery, then, pressure in my skull is being relieved mainly by a steroid (Decadron)
and a 'cocktail' of Benadryl, Tylenol, and Raglan. I am stable and feel ok, except on any
type of exertion (like going to the bathroom), at which point I get a searing pain in my
head. Unless anything acute occurs, I should be ok for a few more days. 
For now, treatment of my OC remains off until the brain issue is attended to. And that's
ok as my last scan was stable. I don't know about the modalities of dealing with two
types of cancer. Tbd.
The staff here continues to be terrific, from doctors to sheet changers. They are all kind,
attentive, and skilled. I am being very well taken care of here and am grateful for it.
(Last Monday, Dr. Patel's PA was ineffectual; when I told her my headache pain was a 10,
her mouth formed into a little circle as she whispered ""Oh."" I thought she would send me
to have a brain MRI immediately, not wait another day. Otherwise, she prescribed a
broad spectrum antibiotic and some Tylenol w/Percocet. I had to come home and lie
down immediately. Lesson: be one's own  best advocate).
I have a few fairy godmothers from within the hospital to thank! Chaplain Cooper
(Rhonda, with whom I've developed a friendship and who always leaves me with a
blessing of invitation to the Spirit and/or of gratitude for the caregivers) brought me,
yesterday, per my cravings, a container of half-sour pickles and a box of cookies from
Vaccaro's -- all from wonderful Italian take out places in Canton. Then Gae, a palliative
care nurse with whom I've bonded around mindfulness, Kripalu, meditation and other
topics (including my work!), also brought me Tiramisu from an Italian restaurant so we
can do a Tiramisu taste test, and some rainbow cookies, which I love. How kind!
                       988 / 1.901
Another dear angel from State College, Helen, and her dear hubby, Greg, also drove
down from State College (3+ hours) to bring me clothes, makeup, my computer and iPad
and other items, plus French pastries.  It's indeed a nice (albeit very cold, apparently)
day to take the pretty drive from SC to Baltimore, while listening to podcasts;
nevertheless, Helen is preparing for a big work trip tomorrow and she and Greg definitely
went out of their way to help. So very thoughtful; Helen did not like thinking of me
without my stuff. So now I'm snug in a pink cotton shirt I like and yoga pants, Kiehl's
serums and avocado eye cream at the ready.
Thanks too to very dear ones Martina, Jackie, Janis, Michael and of course Ethan, Ben etc.
for keeping everything in order for me at home and elsewhere. We are still discussing
which person will be with me next week (>Covid rules: one person allowed in over seven
day period).

All spoken like a cancer patient I suppose.
Life is strange and wonderful and mysterious and awful, on occasion. This new 'through

I can honestly say that many milestones were met yesterday, especially from the time I
saw her in the am until I left just past 6 pm.
In somewhat of a chronological order:
She began to have an appetite, eating cereal, greek yogurt, tuna salad sandwich
on stale bread and omelette w/potatoes.
She put her glasses on for the first time since just prior to surgery. Vital for
Willa’s existence.
She easily passed all of her neurological, bedside exams of reciting name, date,
bday, and location, as well as touching fingers to nose, etc.
She was moved off the NCCU to the top floor of Zayed (12E), a step down room,
and launching pad towards recovery.
She was able to get off the bed and make it to the bathroom, as her digestive
system was beginning to wake up after lengthy periods of anesthesia and
sedation. 
She received encouraging reports and visits from Dr Bettegowda (who called me
as well) and Dr Beavis, assuring her that everything was “par for the course”and
take it “slow and steady”.
                    
The transfer from nccu (3rd floor zayed) to 12E was uncomfortable, and a bit noisy, as
one would potentially expect. We all tried to minimize the disruption though and it
transpired fairly quickly. I successfully wheeled and moved her luggage, with phone,
laptop, keepsakes in it, that she has yet to use.
She did get taken for an mri (protocol/don’t know results yet), soon after arrival on 12,
which really jostled her and upset her. Fortunately her new nurses and technicians,
eased her back to a comfortable state quickly.
Right before I left, Ben (my nephew!) called and I was able to put him on speaker so that
he and Willa could talk. This was the first time they spoke since Tuesday evening.
Needless to say - highlight of the day hearing them converse.
I’m grateful that I brought a lb. of my Zabar’s coffee, cone, and filter from NYC, for
modern technology (iphones, JH), my friends (college roommate took me out to dinner
last night at Fells Point’s The Black Olive), family (our cousins the Eagles left a beautiful
care package), and for sticking by our side, and the vast network of concerned friends
out there!
LGR - my kids will be at the Henrik Lundquist Jersey/# retirement ceremony and game
this evening at MSG. I’m glad they will be together making another sibling memory.

249,"Willa is currently in the hall with the physical therapist taking her second walk in two
days. I believe they are practicing stairs, as Willa has a few to negotiate getting into her
house in SC. Her walking with a walker is quite good btw.
As Willa said to me when I arrived this morning, she’s been getting “micro-sleeps”. She
will need much needed rest in the coming days and weeks.
Yesterday was a total blur for me as almost too many moving parts were happening
simultaneously. I called in my resources, and Ben arrived by Amtrak around 11 pm last
evening. Good thing, as he texted me moments ago that the Northeast Regional and
Acela trains were all suspended.
The neurosurgeons have reassured me that they have “addressed the problem”, she is
“in control”, and that there isn’t anything they can do for her at the hospital, that she
can’t do for herself at home. Hopefully the latter will come with much assistance from
qualified professionals and a host of family/friends.
It appears that Willa will be discharged today!
For me this is both an exciting and frightening prospect.
Depending on the hour, we will most likely stay overnight in Baltimore and venture back
to SC on Sunday morning.
Stay tuned/Much love - Ethan
                    
ps - I forgot to mention that Willa had a nice nurse yesterday from the Congo, Vigeur,
whom she conversed with in French.

and me headed home to NYC by train.
It will take awhile to process this one, but I know that she is in good hands, ready to
tackle whatever comes next and start working on some of the goals she had set prior to
surgery.

252,"I wonder if Dorothy was having a neurological incident when ""the wind began to
switch/The house to pitch/and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch."" Several hours
later -- or was it eons? - she was back in her bedroom in Kansas, surrounded by the
familiar, watchful faces of Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the farmhands, her erstwhile
companions, at some point, on a fantastic voyage to Oz. ""There, there, you lie quiet. You
just had a bad dream."" And that's where I found myself, in the glow of a cold late January
afternoon yesterday, after a two week odyssey, back in my bedroom, under the watchful
eyes of my companions. But it was Ben and Sammi making shaksuka in the kitchen (a
healthy, nourishing dinner). And it was Michael bringing black raspberry flying saucers
from Meyers' Dairy. And it was Maria, overseeing my first  shower in two weeks (bacterial
wipes had sufficed in the hospital). And it was pails full of fresh flowers being carted into
my home from my friend Andrew and his sweet daughter/former student/former
elementary school pal of Ben's (that's how we roll around here), Clare. And it was gifts
and notes from my angels Clare C., Martina, Jackie, Kathryn, Monique, Helen (and likely
others). Their spirits have all tarried near me the past two weeks. Weren't they all here
with me, at some point, in a galaxy far, far away?
The witch with her spindly legs lay dead under the house, just like metastasized shavings
from my cerebellum had shriveled and died, too.
I have the utmost compassion for my fellow neuro survivors: stroke victims, those
surviving with brain cancer, contending with gamma knives and radiation, those with
spinal cord injuries. Two notes: compassion does not equal pity party; compassion for
neuro patients does not negate my strong feelings of empathy for those contending with
other diseases such as MS. But we are really dealing with Command Central for all that is
vital to identity, memory, coordination, motor control, all that is vital to one's essence.
We are in another realm.
All Hail and Praise to Dr. Chetan Beddegowda at Johns Hopkins, the man who saved my
life. He has all the qualities I could ever imagine a stellar neurosurgeon to possess:
patience, steady hands, laser-sharp (pun intended) focus, compassion, thoroughness,
meticulousness, deliberateness, modesty despite confidence. Early forties (?), Hopkins
trained, chaired professor of neurosurgery. Every early morning or  late evening post
surgery, he would appear at my bedside quietly, like a cat, to check on me and answer
all my questions thoroughly and patiently in a quiet, calm, reassuring tone. I am glad
that the young Dr. Christopher Walker, trained by Dr. Beddegowda, saw to it that I
received care only from a 'higher up,' untinged by any ego game on his part.
Apparently, the surgery went very well. Not only did Dr. Beddegowda remove the
diseased parts of my cerebellum; he also was able to manipulate fluid so things would
run more smoothly (I'm hopelessly defective in terms of 'neuro lingo,' but you get my
                    
point). We will now proceed to radiate other cancerous parts of the brain, which I believe
can be done here (I'll have my first radiation consult on Wednesday). The crucial thing,
as the Dr. told me, is that I simply needed the surgery to relieve the pressure building at
the base of my skull in a worrisome way, as clearly reflected in Martina's expression as
she stood on the roof of Lewistown Hospital clutching my vomit soaked sweater and
comfy but ugly black Skechers, watching helplessly as I was air lifted to Hopkins. At my
last meeting with Dr. Beddegowda, he broke Covid protocol and took my hand in his,
gratified for the essential human contact passing between us.
The only way out was through. As mentioned, had we proceeded straight to radiation,
bypassing a surgical option, I'd probably make it a few months. The surgery gives me the
best chance at optimizing my quality of life for as long as I'm here (more on that at some
point). And I really want to be here.
I also thank Dr. Gawad Kalifa, Dr. Beddegowda's resident, for checking my incision daily,
answering my questions, and showing much kindness towards me.
I am flabbergasted to find my overall motor skills so finely tuned, although there may be
a bit of denial involved. I am still using a walker. I can't drive for about 6-9 weeks. I will
be receiving OT/PT/LpN (Licensed Practical Nurse) help by next week at the latest
(covered by Aetna). However, I can text (for better or worse), talk on the phone, write
etc. and did not have to 'relearn' basic skills I thought I would need. My memory,
intelligence and personality have remained unchanged, one of my biggest concerns. I do
need a bit of help with coordination. And I may need some help with 'executive function'
(like better ways of bill paying), little tips for getting dressed, cooking that I love to do
etc.
All Hail and Praise to the extraordinary nursing staff at Hopkins. And much praise to the
Lewistown Hospital ER, run as a tight ship by Mallory. They saw me promptly, got me
into an MRI tube quickly to take images of my brain, noted the mets, got on the phone
quickly with Hopkins and had me dispatched there swiftly. So much better than Mount
Nittany Medical Center, IMO. The staff at Hopkins is uniformly skilled and compassionate,
undertaking challenging work for (likely) low pay in very challenging conditions due in
part to Covid. Nurse Jamie Levy is a wonder: take charge, upbeat, skillful - she reminds
me of my friend the art historian Marni Kessler! We were able to dish about favorite
books, upcoming vacations while I trusted her entirely. And let's hear it for the two Tylers
(unflappable, kind, skillful young guys), Bo with her bleached blonde hair and her tanning
beds (and her consummate skill), Carissa, Lynn, Cristina and many others. It was in my
power to be kind (even though packing four nursing students into a small room tried my
patience at times), while the staff remained unfailingly professional -- and kept me Covid
safe the whole time.
Brain cancer surgery and treatment is not for the faint of heart. Please see photo of my
                    
arm, below. It is covered with a huge black and blue mark. Today I went to see a nurse
simply to have various needles and catheters removed from my body. In the hospital, I
received a Foley catheter and then two stray caths because I couldn't pee. I had two
MRIs of my brain; after each experience of being inserted into a tube while I had to
remain ultra still and listen to the sound of jack hammering around my head for 45
minutes, I was sort of 'dumped' back into a hallway while awaiting transport back to my
room - a lonely, dispiriting time. Once my MRI was promised for 11 p.m. but did not
happen until 7 a.m., which messed up my biorhythms. I had a last minute 'surprise' when
my port became occluded and needed to have a special med injected into it - that took
the final few hours of discharge day, as did various magnesium and potassium drips. And
there were lots of late night procedures, pokes, prods, vitals, finger pricks for blood
sugar etc. A piece of my skull has been removed. There is titanium mesh under it and a
titanium rod has been placed somewhere. I have about 25 stitches in a large spiral at the
base of my neck, am covered in iodine stripes. I'm pumped up on Oxycontin and
Decadron, a steroid, plus about eight other meds. Neck pain is considerable yet
diminishing. A warrior of sorts. And I've made it to the other side.
So yes, I am 'coming along.' My brother, who catered to my every need, oversaw every
detail, was my only visitor for a week (Covid oblige...) but we got Ben down to Baltimore
before the northeast corridor was completely shut to train travel. Sammi is also here
now; she took the train from NY (just as her neighbor, Mr. Lopez, was having chest pains
and needed to be attended to by EMS...). There was also a reference on CB to my
'sassiness' at some point (>Party in Willa's room later??) and appearances and
disappearances by random college classmates. Apparently the wives are now deputized
to send greetings from their spouses, the classmates I haven't spoken to since three
reunions ago. My point is that I've worked very hard for the past three years to curate a
safe space and I fear that the Caring Bridge I've worked so hard to maintain may be at
risk of breaking. If you cannot commit to respectfully following me/joining me in my
journey, I simply ask that you go away. I do understand the need to communicate well
wishes. The vast majority of my readers are a great solace to me. But I'm recovering
from - well - brain surgery, for fuck's sake.
But I digress.
Finally, I thank Dr. Beavis for 'quarterbacking' my entire stay. She was uninvolved in the
neuro side of things but she was able to see the big picture and let me know what was
going on. She was waiting for me in the hallway as I arrived from Geisinger. She and her
pal, Dr. Schneider, were the antidote to the neuro team. While of course Dr. Beavis is a
superior physician and surgeon, there was something I appreciated in her slightly more
'hands on' (literally) approach and manner of showing compassion.
I asked her thoughts on patients dying, sometime during the first week. She strongly
believes that, if possible, people should have the death they want, a 'good death.' This is
                    
something I'll be thinking/reading more about (but not becoming obsessed with!). If
someone wishes to gather family at the beach for a final hurrah, those wishes should be
respected. My father did not have the death he wanted, I believe. It was a nightmarish
four-year ordeal punctuated by ERs, a rotation of caregivers, dirt, vermin and sadness,
despite my brother's valiant efforts. So I'm thinking about a villa in southern France in a
pretty village with a great market, a pool and maybe a chef! Day trips. Family and
friends invited for good conversation and healthful, delicious food.
Finally, let me thank the wonderful chaplain Rhonda Cooper for bringing me Italian
cookies from Vaccaro's and tiramisu, along with a palliative care nurse, Gae (or maybe
Jae) -- tiramisu and rainbow cookies from Brooklyn - and pickles! I am somewhat
obsessed with 'old school' Italian pastry so, contrasted with my more or less daily
hospital quesadilla and small Caesar salad, these treats were manna!
And yes, one more -- my dear first cousin David (our mothers are sisters) and wife Ilene
(Yehudis), left me thoughtful care packages from some great kosher delis in Baltimore:
bagels, cream cheese, whitefish spread, bran muffins - delicious! And I so appreciate
your wanting 'a world with Willa in it' and for taking the time to have some words with
your eldest daughter, Toby, at the cemetery. I feel Toby's spirit and power breathing life
into me. Her acts of goodness know no bounds and have clearly continued outside the
bonds of her earthly existence.
To be continued - this will likely need to be cleaned up, but there's a lot to write...

253,"Thanks for the many comments and expression of concern on my last blog. I actually
wrote most of it in my head in the hospital, when I was bored. My former mentor Tony
Judt used a similar technique in _The Memory Chalet_ (forgive missing accent), at night,
as his body wasted from ALS. I had to convey a sense of what I was going through. But
my wise, caring, skilled friend Dr. Andrew Compaine is right: I need to heal my psyche,
not just my poor old organ (although it felt like it got a workout last night when I was
writing!).
So a few more things:
I was gifted the most amazing privilege my first night post-op, as machines buzzed and
whirred in the ICU, as I lay all night with neurons pulsing (do they pulse?), as the drugs
acted both to sedate and relax me, as I drifted in and out of sleep, as God (according to
chaplain Naftali) stood close by my bedside, where I *needed* them to be: I was able to
                    
review what seemed like my entire life. It was very clarifying. First, I revisited in detail
the first two car trips Michael and I ever took to France: I was still very caught up in the
small village life, in French food and wine culture, in certain stereotypes. So we detoured
to the Vouvray wine region in the Loire Valley because we had discovered we liked the
wine, enjoyed incredible meals in Lyon, Dijon and the Pyrenees (sorry for lack of
accents), the thick Michelin guidebooks (red and green) and the maps strewing the car.
The gleaming silver canisters filled with fragrant peach sorbet set among the rustic
stones of Provence returned to me, and the best ratatouille ever (in a paper container at
market, slathered and thick with olive oil and fresh thyme and salty olives), falling asleep
under a tree in a village in the southwest after imbibing too many prunes in Armagnac
on a hot summer day. A picture perfect Sunday brunch in a Provencal hill town (insert
accent under 'c'), under a billowing white cloth, daisies casually placed in a vase, a crisp
rose chilling while we ate sweet/salty tomato jam on pain grille, I snapped a picture of
the often fairly high strung Michael leaning on one hand in a loose open man tailored
shirt, looking more relaxed than I had ever seen him (I think I took that pic to the
hospital when Ben was born, to calm me down). It's a miracle that we survived the car
ride down from that hilltop. Then I reviewed in detail the first two trips we took to Paris
with Ben, also relatively happy times. Then, somehow, the power dynamics among us
started to shift, things slipped out of harmony. In the end, though, I think both Michael
and I got the lives we wanted (aside from illness, naturally), and I'm grateful for Sue's
role in it.  Took a few years. For my part, it was much about independence (cue Joni
Mitchell's ""Cactus Tree"" should you wish to know more). So all is harmonious there, and
everything around Ben is surrounded in goodness and light (from the cosmic perspective
of that night).
A blotch appeared on my life (it actually appeared as a big black blotch in this dream). It
is documented in my personal archive, in a poem, stories, diaries, and dream books.  My
archive (thank goodness for my family's collective archival impulse!) also contains all my
date books from about 1977 on (stuffed with ticket stubs etc.), reams of letters from my
mother, father, brother, grandmother, cousin Julie, ex-college bf Greg, air letters from
France, photos, mementoes, copies of letters I've written that friends have shared with
me. I know the word 'archive' is rather high falutin, but it will remain (probably in clear
plastic boxes except if I want to go full Baudelairean and transform my archive into ""un
gros meuble à tiroirs encombré de bilans,/De vers, de billets doux, de procès, de
romances,/Avec de lourds cheveux roulés dans des quittances"") for grandchildren or
really anyone who would like a snapshot of what life was like for a girl growing up in NYC
in the 1970s/80s, who then became enamored of France, spending most of her twenties
there post-Harvard, then moving into grad school at NYU and a thirty+ year professional
life. Likely more on this later. I'll put together an archive for Ben, too.
The professional stuff (notes, books, articles, course materials) is in in boxes, on my book
shelves, and out in the world, where it should be.
                    
By the morning I was not understanding why people didn't say ""I love you"" to each other
more. There is a tendency to banalize this phrase, I suppose, but I realize it's something I
say fairly rarely to my friends and even certain family members. In my dream I had much
clarity about which friends and family members had succeeded in knowing me
authentically, and vice-versa. There has sometimes been tussle and what I would call
'smackdown' or 'throwdown' - relationships are not easy - but we've kept it real over
many years. A few examples come to mind (and these are *not* exclusive): my dear
mother, my dear friend Vinni, my equally dear friend Monique, my beloved cousin Julie
Eagle-Cardo, Michael. I need to think further about other examples, but please know my
great gratitude for 'keeping it real' with me. When my rabbi from State College, David
Ostrich, and I spoke on the phone about a week ago, he shared with me his thought that
this (final?) phase can be very clarifying -- about relationships, about what's of value. 
I really don't remember much else. In the morning I felt like I had been through the
wringer. By the third night, my dreams had returned to the relatively banal (I had a
French class to teach a large group on the top floor of an exposed industrial building in
sweltering heat - 95/100 degrees - the dominant color was blood red. I wore a stretched
out pink/red t-shirt and crumpled slacks. I told the students that I wanted to do some
grammar review and then go over related content but I was so thirsty I was slurring my
words. The students were hanging in there with me but seemed physically
uncomfortable exposed to the brutal sunlight. It was the opposite of the carefree Sunday
image of lunch with Michael in the hill town).
Lifespan: I am unsure how long I'll be here. My oncologist here. Dr. Patel, refuses to
make predictions because each case is so individualized. But now it seems germane. Dr.
Beavis suggested 6 months-two years, with my lying somewhat on the outer edge of life
expectancies situated in a bell curve. Initially, this very short time period threw me for a
loop. But I'm also scrolling through accounts of patients defying their oncologists'
predictions; we know that Hopkins patients receive the best care and therefore live
longer, that I'm a vibrant woman in my early 60s with no pre-existing conditions, that my
spirit is strong yadda yadda. At the same time, there is the new reality of dealing with
two cancers (OC treatment on hold for now but will be resumed) and all the attendant
risks. Thankfully, none of this is holding me back right now.
Reading: To distract myself pre-op, I  read a 600+ page book in the hospital! Thomas
Doerr's new novel, _Cloud Cuckoo Land,_ was an excellent choice for me as, while
confronting the interlocking destinies of five characters everywhere from medieval
Constantinople through the future, with forays into eco-terrorism, the Korean War, the
travails of a working class single mom in rural Idaho and more, the book was also (imo)
about the power of *storytelling* to stave off illness, death, current reality. While
referencing Eco and Borges, the ambitious novel had a Scheherazade, _1001 Nights_
vibe! I stayed up late at night in the hospital reading, counting on the power of stories to
take me away...
                    
Today: Sammi nicely drove me to my PCP's this morning. We saw Dr. Damaske's PA,
went over all my medications. clarified wound care. The LpN (nurse) arrives tomorrow to
assess me. Justin, Dr. Beddegowda, Mount Nittany etc. all in the loop (suture removal?
radiation set up?). It's calm here and I'm trying to rest (very tired). Sammi and Ben
continue to take compassionate care of me; Ethan following me closely from NY and
making useful suggestions.

254,"Things are moving forward. I am gathering strength, resting a lot, trying to recreate my
natural biorhythms (while hardly sleeping at all last night...!).
*My head sutures will be removed next week, in town (Dr. Bettegowda at Hopkins is fine
with this, and it will save me multiple tiring trips to Baltimore);
*I will see a radiation oncologist, also locally, in a week; I'm still in a 'healing phase' and
we await a final pathology report from JH. Dr. Bettegowda is also fine with my staying
local; a blessing. At that point, a 'radiation plan' will be established. I know very little
about radiation, how it will affect me. I hope it won't be any more or less taxing than
chemo. The goal is to irradiate the mets Dr. Bettegowda was unable to get out and keep
the cancer in check.  *Dr. Beavis called me yesterday late afternoon and we spoke for
about an hour. This was incredibly comforting. She's clearly thinking ahead to restarting
chemo for my OC (the ultimate source of all this trouble), but not before the end of the
month at the earliest. Meanwhile, she will test my new tumors to see which treatments
might be preferable. I'm now off the clinical trial, unfortunately, because of the new brain
findings, but may be eligible for other trials. We will likely stay on Taxol. It is possible
that I'll try Avastin, which sounded like it had a potentially scary side effect; but as my
own situation becomes a bit more risky, Avastin becomes a more realistic option. This
(timetable, plan) will all need to be coordinated with the radiation oncologist (also Dr.
Patel) and my medical oncologist here, Dr. Patel. But first things first. I'll go to JH to see
Dr. Beavis at end of the month. We had such a good chat; she encouraged me to stay
focused on the positives (I came through surgery very well, sound really strong etc.). She
filled me in on some details about my arrival by helicopter at JH, when she, Dr. Schneider
                    
and others were crowding into my room, waiting for me. She's quite content for me to
rest this week. She sounded relieved.
*Spent 2+ hours earlier this week with RN sent by nursing agency. Karen was kind and
thorough, did intake, checked my vitals, got me ready for PT and OT appointments next
week. I'll receive five weeks of each, perhaps weekly, covered by insurance. Still hoping
for a little help around the house, although my cleaner's coming next week. I get tired
and am not 100% steady on my feet.
*Received delicious meals from kind friends who I asked specifically to cook for me.
Thank you, Tamar, Helen, Deb and Tony, Kathryn and John and likely others!
*Have been waited on hand and foot by Ben and Sammi: medication organization and
delivery, meal prep and clean up, errands, tasks around the house. Their calm, kind
presence this past week has been a balm. Sammi is headed back to NY today while Ben
stays a few more days. 
*Had my shower head entirely replaced by the awesome 'Rosie the Riveter' aka Maria,
who is both an expert plumber (who knew?) *and* an expert on modern Italian kid lit!
*Am enjoying a two month 'coda' in my year marked by the number '4' and that seems
to carry a good energy with it: today is my friend Monique's birthday (2/4), next month is
mine (3/4), then Ben's (4/4) and Michael's comes between mine and Ben's (2/24). The
natural world will change much between February and April. Due to the gloomy, icy
weather today, with town and campus basically shut down, I am cozily observing it from
my pretty sunroom, with its big bay windows turned towards outside.
And so, while my world has been somewhat upended and my life expectancy potentially
cut short, I am feeling preternaturally calm and content. Strange, eh?  I hardly slept, but
my body was still and relaxed. I planned out a modest bday party for myself and pretty
much wrote this blog in my head. On to a few bills (there are many....). Must get off my
social media devices at night. Ben ordered a new reading lamp for me and I plan to
replace those wasteful bedtime hours with more reading every night -- Whitehead,
Shteyngart....

255,"Things are moving forward. All in all, it's been a pretty good week. Here are some
updates:
Monday (2/7): Ben and I had a bit of an emotional parting. I started to get anxious about
                    
how I would fare on my own, as did he, despite his herculean efforts to set everything up
expertly for me (meds, appointments etc.). He and Sammi took incredible care of me for
a week (I was so happy to send them heart-shaped boxes of Jacques Torres truffles as a
modest thank you). We worked through our tears and anxieties and got to a better place
before Michael came to pick Ben up for lunch and then take him to the Megabus.
It turns out I've been fine. Shortly after Ben left, I worked with my therapist (online) and
part of what I got out of it was a revised attitude towards my sleeping, realizing that I do
not, in fact, need to be awake through the night to maximize my time (terribly
counterproductive as I'm usually tired the next day). Yet, the thoughts keep coming as I
drift in and out of galaxies. My friend Maria came by later to deliver unsweetened
cranberry juice for a minor UTI that, thankfully, now seems to be resolved with a few
days of antibiotics. And there was a lot of couch resting and snoozing.
Tuesday (2/8): A locksmith came in the morning to rekey my doors, which I felt
necessary. Later, the LpN came by, just to take vitals. From 4-6 a very nice woman
named Abbye was here; she's a local woman who does errands, tasks around the house,
things I might be too tired to do right now. She washed my dishes, made my bed, ran a
bunch of errands for me (dry cleaners, framing shop, Ulta). She's sort of the 'missing link'
in terms of my care right now, and is extremely helpful. Lots of couch resting and
snoozing.
Wednesday (2/9): My house was thoroughly cleaned by my two house cleaners and is
getting back to being a very calm, hospitable environment. That took a few hours. In the
afternoon, someone from PT came and we did some exercises. I am doing very well on
that front, don't even use a walker, use a cane sometimes when I go out. I lack some
strength but am working on it (sorta). I am also throwing out/purging/paring as much as I
can from my house; it's time. Ben and I threw away three massive boxes of my class
notes and I've finally gotten the top of my desk all clear. This will continue; it's crucial to
my sanity. Lots of resting and snoozing in my sunroom, so peaceful.
One day (I forget which), Isabelle and Vinni, my dear grad school friends, sent me four
*pints* of the most delicious ice cream packed in dry ice, from a place in Maine called
Rococo (self-indulgent ice cream as its name suggests). Maine Whoopie Pie, Cardamom
Chai, Pear Caramelized Ginger (my favorite) and Goat Cheese Blueberry Chambord are
all heavenly! So sweet and thoughtful of them; they were encouraging me to eat ice
cream for breakfast, too!
Thursday (2/10): OT came for a visit. Two takeaways were a)to buy a foam mat for my
bathroom that depresses with my footprints and does not move around when I exit the
shower (which I'm able to do) and b)keep bowls and dishes I need at a handy reach
(currently not the case). Later that afternoon, Abbye came over for about two hours and
did more errands and tasks for me (changing the water in my flowers, the vases are
                    
heavy etc.). Lots of resting in my sunroom. Ben and I had cooked all my meals for the
week (a pot roast with udon noodles, corn, broccoli and Thai-ish bbq sauce; butternut
squash; butternut squash soup etc.) so I was set on that front. Taking many meds
throughout the day, including the last of the Oxycodone for pain and a tapering down
steroid, Decadron.
Thursday (I think) my friend Deb Guerrero brought me lots of goodies from my
hometown! These included 'viennoiseries' from a bakery across from her place in
Chelsea; a Breads Bakery babka (the grail...); two Breads Bakery loaf cakes (to be shared
on my birthday) *and* a lasagna from her husband Tony, who is a great cook (I had it
last night; very tasty indeed). Deb and I drove to NY together not too long ago and we
have kids around the same age. I hope we'll be able to do that again sometime; we had
fun.
To be continued now  - this link is acting up....",2,fear,0.41283882,0.0072657173,0.0016442329,0.41283882,0.38330102,0.10491605,0.0623052,0.02772894
256,"Friday (2/11): two-hour consult with radiation oncology at MNMC (the hospital), with a
nice nurse and then the very young radiation oncologist, Dr. Veejay Patel (no relation). I
did not come away entirely happy, and tomorrow and Monday I need to get to emails,
likely with Dr. Bettegowda at Hopkins, Dr. Beavis and perhaps Dr. (Nilesh) Patel.
Everything with the nurse was fine: we reviewed my meds, went over the procedure for
radiation. This coming Monday I'll have a CT scan at the hospital; then it will take about
7-10 days for the oncologist and physicist (!) to read and study the images, make a
model (I think) and work out the details of my plan (schedule, duration, targeted
locations etc.). The nurse showed me a positively medieval, Monty-Pythonesque looking
mesh helmet that I have to wear and that then gets bolted into another surface during
radiation. The better news is that the radiation treatments are fairly short, nothing like
the 30 mn or so I needed to hold still during MRIs. These treatments, it seems, are more
like a few minutes. Potential side effects; hair loss (done deal already), nausea and
vomiting, fatigue; skin rashes, burns; etc. Nothing I haven't contended with before (other
than the skin issues).
What annoyed me is lack of consultation/coordination among my doctors, specifically
between Dr. V. Patel and the others. He told me what he wanted to do for me and what
he planned to do but I made him assure me that he would talk to Dr. Bettegowda first.
Frankly, I thought that a different set of mets needed to be radiated than the ones he
proposed but I could be wrong; obviously, we all need to be on the same page about
this. And I am hoping he has read my file very carefully (at one point, he alluded to it
being very 'thick' but I am worried that he hasn't read it carefully). *He* asked *me* if I
was supposed to get full brain radiation -- dear God... Also, they do not use gamma knife
technology at MNMC, which I know to be quite cutting edge (pun intended?). Part of me
wants to bag MNMC and be treated at Hopkins, but there is a real advantage in my
receiving treatment here, not having to make 7 hour round trips to Baltimore; being able
to be in my home, near my friends, in my comfort zone. Dr. Bettegowda was fine with
me being treated here in State College -- as long as the treatment is good (of course
they do this all the time at MNMC but I am anxious).
[In all honesty, what Dr. V. Patel described as treatment did not sound that bad: 3-5
treatments (but there again I thought that contradicted what I had been told], a good
prognosis (but how does that jive with my life expectancy?). Maybe I'm so used to
arduous treatments that I'm surprised this seems so 'lite.' I'm confused and need more
info, which I'll get. :(
So voilà. I am letting things 'sit' as nothing happens over the weekend, Dr. V. Patel said
he'd be in touch with Dr. Bettegowda and I currently feel ok (sleep still a bit wonky, but
improving) Tomorrow I'll start crafting emails. Dr. Beavis can always 'quarterback' for me
even if she's not a neurologist. I worked a lot of this plan out with my trusted  and kind
                    
friend Jackie, who was kind enough to drive me to both appointments yesterday, with a
cappuccino stop in between. Needless to say, I needed this help! 
A bit unnerving. I came home and rested for a while. Then it was time to go to Gray's
Woods to have my sutures removed by Dr. Damaske's nurse practitioner. This proceeded
smoothly and I'm glad to no longer have stitches (you can see my 'before' picture above
- not for the faint of heart....). After the suture removal, I climbed into bed at home and
took a nap.
****
Maria is coming over in a while and we'll take a short jaunt into the country on this pretty
day. Thanks too to Monique for the treats and to my friends Cheryl and Sandy (and Jon
and Ron) for the opportunity to have a delicious Valentine's Day meal from the
Hummingbird Room tonight. I wish I could join you but need to be 'under wraps' at home
for just a few weeks more while I recover. And Mary, thank you for the MBB gift card! I
am dreaming of fresh fish from Maine, which I will make with za'atar and preserved
lemons (easy enough). And to everyone else for texts, emails, well wishes. I hope not to
have forgotten anyone. I am so grateful.
I guess I'm progressing further into one of my nine lives (I actually don't think I've had
that many), this one as a cancer patient. Although I hate any thought of myself as an
'invalid' (""in-valid??""), I do need to be a bit dependent right now.  And this new stage as
a cancer patient is simply...different than the previous ones. It's becoming somewhat
easier for me to sit with the dichotomies and contradictions, the 'double lives' (doubles
vies>W of the Perec novel's title).",2,fear,0.31366163,0.07238203,0.012678087,0.31366163,0.07633134,0.22689728,0.14191802,0.15613167
257,"Because there was some concern about the confusion surrounding my radiation
treatment options, including seeming lack of coordination among members of my
medical team, here's a brief update:
Drs. V. Patel and Bettegowda spoke by phone and I feel much better about things now.
At this point, I am leaning about 98% towards 3-5 stereotactic radiation treatments here
in State College, mainly or exclusively directed at my cerebellum. The confusion over
what to radiate stems from the fact that there is another tiny spot that *may or may not
be cancer* in my brain as opposed to what Dr. Patel called an 'artefact;' they will know
more once they study CT imaging I had done this morning at the hospital. Regarding
gamma/cyberknife: according to Dr. Patel, there is *no data* indicating that
gamma/cyberknife is a *better* technology; whether or not to have it available is an
institutional choice. The technique he will use will accomplish the same thing, and he is
hopeful that my cancer will not recur there (but one never knows, I suppose...). And then
it will be back to chemo to treat my ovarian cancer: whee!! Dr. Bettegowda is completely
on the same page as Dr. Patel. So that's the plan. Full-brain radiation is not in the
picture; it will be very directed. I had written to Dr. Beavis asking her to 'quarterback' for
me, then walked that back a bit after my time at the hospital this morning. She's aware
of the situation, though, and may insert herself into the conversation somehow. My last
email will likely be to Dr. Bettegowda (to whom I've already written a thank you note),
just to make sure Dr. Patel's reporting was completely accurate. Each of these
communications does take something out of me as I try to recuperate. Each is stressful
but as mentioned I feel considerably relieved now.
This morning I was at the hospital for a few hours for CT imaging and to have my
'helmet' made in preparation for radiation. Initially, it felt like a lovely spa experience (or
at least I imagined it so), with the warm plastic goop pressed into my face but then it
became less fun. Please see the pics of the personalized Darth Vader helmet I'll be
wearing during radiation, bolted into a table. Oy!

258,"Many thanks to all for your expressions of care and concern. Herewith, a few updates on
the week:
Tuesday (2/15) - My friend Martina was kind enough to take me to my routine
mammogram appointment at Gray's Woods in the morning. Happy to report that that
exam was normal, thankfully. Another cancer would have been a kick in the head (no
wait, I already had that one...). Martina drove me to get a coffee after that and to CVS to
pick up a prescription. And we stopped by the liquor store so I could pick up a few items
to share on my birthday (I am abstaining from alcohol these days; if my doctors ok it, I
might have a small glass of something on my bday). Abbye came by in the afternoon
and ran some errands for me, which is a tremendous help. Frame shop to digitize old
family photos etc....
Wednesday (2/16) - Physical therapy came in the morning and we did some exercises. I
know I should be grateful for weekly visits (which are almost over) from PT, OT and LpN,
but to be honest sometimes I find them disruptive (the therapists often call you on the
day, wanting to come over shortly after that) and tedious, and I'm not too keen on the
therapists themselves.
In the afternoon, my friend Jessica drove me to Spectacles, in part to deal with a new
                    
problem as I try valiantly to address various health kinks: I have an *ulcer* (!) on/in my
eye, which explains why my eye has felt very irritated and scratched recently. Dr.
Damaske's PA had given me antibiotic drops for this but they did not help as this *open
sore* on my eye needs to be treated like a virus (even though it's an infection). I now
have new drops that are helping but my eye is not yet fully better. I have already
returned to the optometrist once for her to check the eye and will return again on
Monday. My eye is healing, but has not yet healed completely. It's truly annoying and
uncomfortable, although I'm not letting it hinder me too much. I may also check in with
the ophthalmologist next week. Once the eye is healed, I'll proceed with getting my new
prescription tweaked and filled, new frames etc. I hadn't seen the optician (Joseph, the
optometrist Julie's husband) in a while. He's French (and Jewish, half-Ashkenazi half-
Sephardic as I recall, last name Haloua) and we always enjoyed chatting in French (this
week was no exception). After I filled him in on my cancer, he shared that he has
epilepsy -- grand mal seizures - and we agreed that serious illness can lead to
unexpected perspectives on just about everything.
Thursday (2/17): Stephanie, the occupational therapist, came by for a short while. She
gave me some ""Thera-Putty"" akin to Silly Putty, which keeps my hands and fingers
supple. This is actually helpful as my hands had been cramping up while doing mundane
chores like writing cards, putting on a necklace etc.
Friday (2/18): It turned out to be a somewhat hectic day, by my current standards. I
spent about two hours or so in the morning making soup (and standing the whole time),
which I hadn't yet done since my surgery, and which did tire me out a bit, but not
excessively. But now I have a good week's worth of meals or supplements, so it was a
worthwhile and enjoyable activity. I made harira, a North African/Middle Eastern
vegetarian soup/stew that I'd made once before and that's very tasty and nutritious:
onions, celery, carrots, crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, turmeric, cumin, salt, pepper,
harissa spice (and paste), coriander, parsley, chick peas, lentils. I usually add more
harissa paste and maybe a dollop of sour cream when I'm eating it and might serve with
a piece of crusty sourdough bread from the Bellefonte Bread Baker. Yum.
Brian the physical therapist called and of course wanted to come over immediately. I
forestalled him a bit before he came by, led me in some exercises, and then pretty much
signed me out in terms of further treatment with him. My optometrist called and wanted
to look at my eye a few hours after that, so I set that up including ride etc. (thank you,
Jackie!). Abbye came by at 3:00, took my laptop to have a new battery installed (an
important errand I haven't been able to get to) and to pick up four delicious fresh fish
fillets from Maine Bay and Berry for me (thank you, Mary, for the gift certificate). For
dinner, I baked a salmon fillet with za'atar and preserved lemon + asparagus + a
delicious potato pancake my friend Helen had picked up at a deli in CT when she was on
a business trip (thank you, Helen, and for the half-sours and the cappuccino at my
doorstep!). Abbye also washed some of the remaining soup making dishes, pots etc. and
                    
made my bed. She's the essential 'missing link' in my care, at least for the next few
weeks as I continue to gather strength.
I also talked to my friend Clare and we planned a little outing for later today, to a
consignment store we both enjoy called ""Arcadian."" Looks a bit gray and wintry out
there, but I am glad to be here!!!
Last night I continued the Sidney Poitier films series I'm curating for myself; I really don't
know why I hadn't seen more of his films aside from ""To Sir, with Love"" (which I had seen
several times). I fully understand now why he was so lauded at his death (and before);
what an amazing actor. I was engrossed in all of these and can recommend (*****) them
all: Lilies of the Field, A Patch of Blue, A Raisin in the Sun, To Sir, with Love, and In in the
Heat of the Night. Anything else I should watch?
Overall, I feel pretty well. I still need a lot of rest; my body gets tired, but I am sleeping
better (although often in several 'chunks'). I am grateful for the reprieve as the doctors
continue to study my brain imaging and work out my radiation plan. I expect radiation
will begin late this week or the beginning of the following. Once my radiation oncologist
clears me, moreover, I need to get back to chemo, likely weekly Taxol (as before the
brain episode) for the time being. I am actually more concerned/nervous about the
chemo than the radiation, but I'm putting it out of my mind for now. Basically, as my
chemo treatment options become fewer, it is likely that they'll become slightly riskier.
More on that -- but not now. The sun just came out! And I'm off to shower, to have a bowl
of harira, and to the consignment store.
Very grateful thanks for all the generous 'acts of affirmation' this week (Paula for the
divine-smelling rose spa treatments; Melissa for the lovely card; Zia for the call and
email>I'll get back to you, especially after Ethan just ran into you on the UWS!; Heather
for the VDay card; Gay for the card; Mar for the tasty turkey chili). Please excuse me if I
neglected to mention you personally here. Thank you to others for reading my blog,
emails and texts etc. It helps me!!",0,anger,0.6044351,0.6044351,0.0054360777,0.03747895,0.08126228,0.18724144,0.054614447,0.029531706
259,"Please direct some good thoughts my way tomorrow (Wednesday) around 10 a.m. when
I begin a new phase of my cancer journey: radiation. I will have five treatments: this
Wednesday and Friday, next Monday and Wednesday and perhaps Monday 7 March (I
need to reschedule, as I asked for a 'reprieve' on my birthday). Each appointment is
short; the first one will consist of a 'dry run' (rehearsal?), followed by radiation (30
minutes total?), the remaining four will take even less time (perhaps 15 minutes). I have
no idea how fatigued I'll be, if I'll have other side effects etc. I am eager for radiation to
get underway. Yesterday, I felt a bit of the type of discomfort I was feeling from swelling
in my head (yet nowhere near the head-splitting pain this became), but perhaps this is
just phantom pain. My dear friend Jackie will take me tomorrow and next Monday, while
kind neighbors the Matthiesens will transport me on Friday. I have another appointment
too on Friday, with my PCP, which I need to arrange a ride to/from. When I return
tomorrow, my home will be in the process of being cleaned (including my perennially
messy study, a huge victory as I've been purging lots of stuff). A very clean home will
help a lot psychologically.
My radiation oncologist, Dr. Patel, continues not to inspire the utmost confidence. I
believe this is due to his 'youth' and relative inexperience. When I spoke to him on the
phone the other day, he led me to believe that what needs to be radiated in my
cerebellum is still sizeable (""not exactly huge, but not exactly small,"" was how he put it,
most inexactly). Imho, the early 40s of Drs. Beavis and Bettegowda (as far as I can tell) is
the sweet spot in terms of age. Dr. Patel the Younger also equivocated on when I should
restart chemo (I could hear hesitation in his voice), despite Dr. Beavis deferring to him
for this decision. He merely told me, hesitatingly, that he had a few patients undergoing
chemo at the same time as radiation. Then Dr. Patel the Elder's scheduler called me to
arrange my chemo; it turns out that Drs. Beavis and Patel the Elder had already
                    
conferred and decided I should resume weekly Taxol as soon as radiation was finished. I
opted for a slightly later appointment than I could have gotten, on March 16th, a)so I
could meet with Dr. Patel instead of his PA (who I also don't trust) prior to chemo and
b)so I can recoup more energy post-radiation. I hope I can delay these extra few days
without negative repercussions. Despite hiccups, things seem to be falling into place for
the next phase.
In better news, the ulcer on my eye appears to be healed but I need to use the drops for
another week. And today I'm generally feeling ok, having slept well in 'only' two chunks.
AND I believe Dr. Bettegowda is clearing me to begin driving on Feb. 26th! I have to
confirm this. I think I'm ready for it, although I won't undertake anything ambitious, just
some short drives to appointments, around town etc.
My former colleague and buddy Jim Davis sent me the most delicious toffee (the
crunchy, buttery, non-gooey kind) from a place in Palm Springs that is known for it,
Brandini. And my friend Scott gifted me a big slab of homemade carrot cake. I think a
conspiracy may be afoot to fatten me, but I'm trying to eat as healthily as possible of my
own accord, and look forward to a bowl of butternut squash soup for lunch.",4,neutral,0.5541139,0.011580573,0.012455028,0.36773536,0.004836375,0.5541139,0.022357963,0.026920768
260,"A brief update: everything seems to have gone smoothly this morning during my first
radiation treatment. I was a bit anxious and slept so-so (perhaps 6-7 hours, in two
installments, with some time for thinking in between). My very responsible friend Jackie
drove me and we wound up talking about the puzzles/word games we do to keep our
minds sharp (I'm a NYTimes Spelling Bee and daily puzzle stalwart, and am dipping my
toes into Wordle, but it involves strategy, which I'm terrible at; a plus for the NYTimes
puzzles, I have a large vocabulary); stuffed animals; and my pre-radiation anxiety. 
The treatment itself was fairly short: 30 minutes all told? The sweat-inducing part was
literally being tightly *bolted* onto a table via the futuristic helmet made for me and
being told that I must lie very still for fear of the radiation being misdirected. Two
technicians conducted the procedure, yet Dr. Patel and The Physicist (an individual I
know only as The Physicist; being fairly scientifically illiterate, unfortunately, I don't know
what she or he does, but I'm curious to find out!) were seated behind a barrier,
supervising (or assisting?). I was told to relax and think pleasant thoughts. I kept my
eyes closed and held as still as possible. Some 'good' easy listening music helped: James
Taylor's ""Carolina in my mind"" (one of my favorite songs), a nice Simon and Garfunkel,
Heart's ""These Dreams."" Perhaps coordinated with all the prayers and well wishes
headed my way at 10 a.m., Queen also came on: ""We are the champions, my friend/And
we'll keep on fighting 'til the end!""
I was most concerned about which side effects I'd feel afterwards. So far I'm doing ok,
rather worn out but unable to sleep so I'm writing. Very low-grade headache, but not
bad. So far, no nausea, vomiting, or visible rashes. We'll see. Next treatment Friday
morning. My kind neighbors Pat and Denis Matthiesen are taking me. They seem
undeterred by the ""wintry mix"" forecasted. My friend Clare will drive me to PCP
appointment that afternoon, weather permitting. Then Jackie will accompany me again
on Monday. Helen and I have a little outing planned for Sunday, in Bellefonte, which I
look forward to.
After treatment today, Jacke drove to Lemont so that we could get coffee at Café
                    
Lemont, a latte for her, a cappuccino with a shot of almond syrup for me, reminiscent of
the steamed whole milk with syrup I drank every evening during my last trimester of
pregnancy, and which contributed to my packing on 70 pounds (I lost most of it, and Ben
was worth every kilo!). Café Lemont's coffee is the best in town, imo.
I'm picking up from a few comments that maybe I'm being too hard on Dr. Patel the
Younger. I will give him the benefit of the doubt; I need to trust him. But I also need to
advocate for myself. Contradictory aims. I am eager to speak with him again.",2,fear,0.85728174,0.0059845424,0.0058459803,0.85728174,0.007069246,0.090279765,0.013643294,0.01989553
261,"Radiation appeared to go smoothly yesterday. The only blip came in the form of a  phone
call in the morning asking if I wanted to shift my appointment to the afternoon, due to
inclement weather that shut our town and campus down for the day. So I moved my
                    
morning appointment to 3:15, forcing me to also shift my afternoon PCP appointment to
another day, as yet unidentified (my PCP does not have openings before July! I'm
working on this with scheduling). In any case, treatment was more crucial than the
relatively routine follow-up appointment with Dr. Damaske (for whom I do have
questions, though, including about when I might have a shingles vaccine).
My helmet-like contraption is bolted so tightly into the table that I was afraid my teeth
would pop out, so firmly are they held in place by a mouth guard! I asked the technicians
(two very nice women) to let me know when 15-10-5 minutes remained; this is helpful.
Otherwise, I close my eyes and listen to ""hits from the 60s, 70s and 80s"" -- yesterday,
Jim Croce, ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,"" Marvin Gaye, ""What's Goin' On?,"" Fleetwood Mac,
""Go your own way,"" the Eagles. I calculate that each song lasts about three minutes; that
means five songs or more per treatment, each lasting 15-30 minutes. During that time,
eyes shut, I hear whirring and buzzing when the radiation is actually directed at my
cerebellum, feel the table rock slightly to secure me into position, smell a singing,
burning odor at one point (unpleasant), and lie still throughout, crick in my neck be
damned. Dr. Patel and ""The Physicist"" (whose name, I recently learned, is Neil) sit in a
control room behind a window, overseeing the treatment (the radiation machine is
actually programmed to deliver the radiation on its own, according to my individualized
radiation plan).
No more than 30 minutes and not bad. When I told the technicians that my side effects
so far were minimal, they found that unsurprising as only a small area is being radiated
(as opposed to, say, an entire abdomen). This contradicts somewhat Dr. Patel the
Younger's assessment of my tumor as ""not exactly big but not exactly small"" so I'm
getting to treatment a bit early on Monday to talk to him about how treatment is going.
My neighbor, Denis Matthiesen, drove me to treatment. Nice man, nice neighbor in his
70s (?), who lives with his wife, Pat (second marriage for each), across the road from me.
From Queens (and has the accent to prove it!), devout practicing Catholic, Democratic
voter (father a lieutenant in the fire department who died of cancer resulting from
fighting fires). Flirtatious to the point of making me a bit uncomfortable at times, but
nothing untoward so far other than a friendly pat on the shoulder (and I know how to
deflect). Monday I'll be with my stalwart pal, Jackie, and Wednesday with another
stalwart pal, Maria. Denis drove me to get a cappuccino after treatment, warming
comfort in a cup.
I slept miserably last night, but I'm ok. I had taken my steroid later in the day because of
the later appointment, and that can cause insomnia, plus I had ingested caffeine 4-5
p.m. Mistakes. I do know how to shut my brain off at night and focus on my music
(Tibetan bowls, chanting, thunder storms, waves) but somehow my brain was stubborn.
So I was galaxy-hopping again.
                    
At first I was shaken by events in Ukraine, grief-stricken for the civilians, impressed by
the courageous resistance of the Ukrainians, fearful that this is yet another 'canary in the
coal mine' harbinger of the blows against (end of??) democracy, thinking of the late
1930s (Munich, Anschluss) (even earlier, centuries earlier) and the power of autocrats,
but in a vastly different, globalized and interconnected world. Somehow, these anxieties
merged with my own interest in genealogy -- we come from that part of the world
(Belarus, Lithuania, about whose history I am realizing I need to know more) -- and I
wondered if Ben would like a narrative account of our family's history. So I pretty much
wrote part of it in my head, relying on some of the documents I have uncovered on
genealogy sites. Of course, the further back you go with Jewish genealogy, the harder it
becomes to trace, similar to the genealogy of former slaves. Scratch the surface and you
come up against the Holocaust, with at least one of my great-grandmother's sisters
deported to a camp in Russia. I'll do more digging.
Then I was was micro-managing a gathering I'm having on my birthday (the 4th),
'making my lists and checking them twice,' ensuring that we'll be well provisioned.
Next I was back to the idea of turning my Caring Bridge journal into a performance piece,
towards which I'm leaning more heavily recently, especially since my therapist and I
discussed how it might be of help to some others, as they have told me my journal is.
This idea is particularly appealing, relieving some of the focus on me and the
particularities of my journey. I also have a partial play list in mind to accompany the
piece, and a wonderful local musician on board to sing/play guitar. I'm in the process of
cutting and pasting the journal into something resembling a book (several hundred
pages so far), and then I'll be moving on to editing, cleaning up, and seeing what I can
do with this behemoth (performance would be both live at my house and live streamed
and other voices would add to mine in the form of the hundreds of comments people
have left, of which I'd choose a modest selection).
Finally, I was revisiting the fun photo shoot my friend, the photographer Stéphane Cojot-
Goldberg, and I joined forces for in Paris in 2019 when I needed some professional shots.
I'd like to do this again with Stéphane on my next Paris trip, with some different locales
featured (the Pont des Arts w/the Institut in the background would be nice, and maybe
l'As du Falafel in the rue des Rosiers could be fun along with other sites in the Marais)
and as long as Stéphane is feeling well enough from his recurrence of and treatment for
leukemia. I'm envisioning some bald shots, different wigs, different outfits. That was
about 3:30 a.m. I think I finally drifted to sleep around 4 a.m. and awoke at 8:00 a.m. My
'carer' Abbye brought me a delicious cappuccino so I'm doing alright, just feel like I have
some cotton balls stuffed inside my head. Luckily, I can rest today and am eyeing my
couch already. Reading's in store, and some house straightening, work on my journal,
maybe some Vever work (to which I returned this week!). Maybe a nap. I look forward to
lunch with my dear friend Helen tomorrow in Bellefonte (Bonfatto's), followed by a stop
at a newish market that sells local products, including local pickles (an obsession of the
                    
past two years) with a lot of spice and snap!
Be well, everyone. Happy 18th birthday to my dear nephew, Isaac. Sorry I can't be in the
city for the festivities as I continue to gather my strength. Hope Ben and Sammi continue
to have fun skiing in Stowe, Vermont, in preparation for their Colorado ski trip.",2,fear,0.41229698,0.019701153,0.07069505,0.41229698,0.007967478,0.24707206,0.09193731,0.15032996
262,"Radiation went smoothly yesterday. Happy to report minimal side effects, beyond some
fatigue. Took about 20 minutes. I had requested to speak to Dr. Patel the Younger before
my treatment. I'm feeling better about him now, just as I warmed up to Dr. Patel the
Elder after a rocky start. Veejay Patel confirmed that treatment was going well, that the
tumor had shrunk considerably (from about a 5 cm size...), that it was fine for me to
have a drink on my birthday, that it was fine for me to restart weekly chemo with Taxol
on 3/16, that the likelihood of my having a stroke or other major neuro event was low as
those affect a different part of the brain (the cerebrum) than the one we are treating etc.
Since then I've thought of additional questions that I will ask him at visit #5. I'm just glad
that radiation is going smoothly and that I feel generally well.
Jackie was kind enough to provide a ride and we had a good chat. After treatment, I
headed to my former Dean's house to drop off some homemade butternut squash bisque
for her (she's a cancer survivor as well). Then we headed to Pump Station for my ritual
post-treatment cappuccino, and ended up in Jackie's car in my driveway having a good
talk about some challenges arising from a situation involving Jackie's sister and her
family in Germany. When I returned home around noon, I lay on the couch for a while
and finished my book (_Sag Harbor,_ an early Colson Whitehead novel; he writes
captivatingly, in this case in a teenage, middle-class Black boy's vernacular, but the
novel has no plot; it ambles along, like the boys' summer at the beach in Long Island,
and that gets tedious after a while. I'm not sure I'd recommend the novel but I wouldn't
dissuade you from reading it either. May move on to Gary Shteyngart next).
I had bad insomnia again last night! That was unexpected. The previous night I had slept
well. I likely made the mistake of (re)watching, shortly before bed, a documentary called
_End Game,_ focusing in part on terminal patients and the kinds of decisions they face
(this was *after* watching the very worrisome news reports from Ukraine). Some of
these patients are being cared for at the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco, founded
                    
by the man who's become my guru for all things End of Life, the physician and palliative
care/hospice care authority, B.J. Miller. As always, B.J. had some compelling things to say
about death (that it fosters ""love, connection"" and something else I can't remember; and
""from what I've seen, what happens after we die ain't all that bad""). He encourages
honoring each patient who dies at Zen Hospice Project by covering their shroud or coffin
with flowers, thereby marrying moments of grief with simplicity and beauty. This gave
me a lot of ideas, much to think about. Plus B.J. is hot, a truly beautiful man in his fifties,
who lost parts of three limbs in a college accident in which he was electrocuted at 19
while goofing off on top of a train car at Princeton U. I need to soon rewatch his popular
TED Talk, ""What Really Matters at the End of Life,"" read some of his writings, and
perhaps find out more about another service he founded, Mettle Health.
B.J. Miller encourages ""cultivating a relationship with death."" But this is such a challenge
when one is enamored of life, as I am. Part of my problem is that once the issue of
lifespan was presented to me, I started to become very anxious. Dr. Beavis, whom I trust
completely, said it could be as short as six months (!!) while Dr. Frader, the head of
KGOS (Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service at Hopkins) told me she had a patient with
my profile (OC then brain mets) who lived for ten years. Dr. (Nilesh) Patel, in my last
convo with him, refuses to pronounces on lifespan, deeming each case highly
individualized. Having gotten over the initial shock about these varied predictions, I need
to query Dr. Beavis further about how she thinks this will all go down: we run out of
treatment options? I develop some sort of complication? I run out of steam? I simply
conform to the overall odds of 50% of OC patients making it five years? How can I
possibly be feeling so good and full of life now and have six months to live? (Dr. Beavis
did say that her prediction tended towards the 'two years' side of the equation and of
course there are 'outliers'). Well, I guess at this point I always come back to the idea of
embracing every day, hour, moment, second and trying to live 'in the moment.' Another
challenge, especially for someone like me, drawn as strongly towards past (nostalgia,
memory) and future (plans, dreams, hopes) as to the present.
Just to put it out there: I do understand that, for all of us, ""none of our tomorrows is
guaranteed"" but let us concede  that this is a more pressing, germane, and 'real' issue
for advanced cancer patients such as myself.
I also want to get a better sense of why I saw a palliative care doc at Hopkins, which at
first I confused with a hospice doc (it is not!). From what I understood, palliative care
coordinates all the different strands of a patient's care (not just medical but also
spiritual, emotional etc.). From B.J's documentary, though, it seemed as if palliative care
was a sort of transitional step, anticipating (even at a far remove) end of life care in
some way. That idea jolted me a bit. I'm either in denial or not understanding something
correctly.
A college classmate, Nancy Audesse, died a few days ago, of throat cancer. I didn't know
                    
her in college, but she seemed an exceptionally brave, clear-sighted soul. When about
fifteen of us classmates gathered at Lisa Peters Driver's funeral a few years ago, Nancy
paid for dinner for all of us, somehow wanting to honor the beauty of that moment and
the warm connections we all formed and furthered in the wake of Lisa's death. At that
dinner, wheelchair-bound Nancy -- recovering from a massive stroke and several bouts
of cancer -- was cared for lovingly by David, another college classmate whom she had
not known prior but with whom she was cultivating a budding romance! Both Nancy and
David had lost long-time partners w/whom they had had loving relationships. They
married shortly afterwards and enjoyed several years of marriage, despite (or because
of?) Nancy's illness. A beautiful love story.
That close-by 'whoosh' of death always unnerves me some -- ""it tolls for thee"" -- although
I'm feeling well overall (despite insomnia) and very much looking forward to my bday on
Friday. In my sleepless state last night, I was fretting about the effect of pressure in air
planes on my brain (yes, I have the travel bug again) and what I would need to tell TSA
about the titanium bolt in my head while going through pre-check.
But today the sun is shining. I've just received a box of luscious pears from Harry and
David (don't know who they are from yet, but thank you!), an eye-catching beaded
dragonfly purse from Jane, with a box of 'schmear' (nova, bagels and lox) to come - what
a treat!; and an iconic Jo Malone shopping bag from my mother, undoubtedly containing
the very divine-smelling gift I was going to offer myself (or something similar)! Will wait
until Friday for the big reveal. My mother has never gotten my tastes wrong, in 63 years!
So much love. I'm a lucky girl. Be well, everyone.",3,joy,0.7813525,0.003885938,0.0039016,0.013923188,0.7813525,0.12640513,0.049845006,0.0206865
263,"A brief note to say that radiation went well yesterday; last treatment will be on Monday! I
have had practically no ill effects except fatigue. I slept well the night before, Maria
                    
picked me up and we were able to gab a bit, treatment took 20 minutes, and then we
were on to Café Lemont to pick up the cappuccinos. I rested for about an hour when I got
home, ate lunch (harira soup/stew; very nourishing) and then was able to work at my
desk for the rest of the day. I look forward to asking more questions and receiving an
update on Monday. Then back to weekly chemo on the 16th - ugh. Dr. Beavis and I have
exchanged emails and will talk by phone or videoconference sometime soon about the
plan going forward. I'll see Dr. Patel (Nilesh) on the 16th, before treatment. I feel well
overall. After a nurse comes to check my incision, my nice neighbor Janis will drive me to
Café Lemont to get a coffee (which I'll be able to do myself as of next Wednesday!).
Like everyone, I'm distraught about events in Ukraine. How can so much love, caring,
concern and respect, such as I've been shown, coexist with such misery, wanton
disregard for civilian life, disrespect for the rights of sovereign states, murderous, power-
greedy intents and autocratic desires (bolstered by nuclear power)? And the bravery of
the Ukranian people, and the many Russians against the war, and others, throughout it
all... I know that comparing my situation as a cancer patient and the complexities of
politics, geopolitics, history etc. is sort of ridiculous and I'm a hopeless Polyanna, but
still... So worrisome. People, our young people, must understand the history (yet also the
novelty of this situation in a globalized context). I awoke about 6:30 today and found
myself scrolling through videos of human suffering, Ukrainians walking miles to reach
border safety, families sleeping in subway stations, children receiving chemo in a kids'
hospital in Kyiv... Regular people, like you and me. What will happen? It won't be good.
How can we help? I've given to International Red Cross and José Andres' World Central
Kitchen (nominate that man for a Nobel Peace Prize, immediately). But what else, when
our own government (rightly, for now, in my view - that nuclear trigger, again) won't put
boots on the ground but is doing everything it can (I think?) through NATO. CaringBridge
is not the forum for this discussion (yet again, maybe it is: health and *caring*), I know,
but please pray that the situation resolves peacefully. It's so upsetting, yet of course this
awful disregard for human rights is not unique to Ukraine...",2,fear,0.90057546,0.0062443134,0.002470148,0.90057546,0.0052333474,0.015290261,0.055671807,0.01451468
264,"This morning I had the last of my five radiation treatments, and all went smoothly. The
technicians asked me if I wanted to *keep* that hideous Monty Python mask as a
'souvenir' (?). No thank you very much, the few pictures I snapped of it will probably do
for a lifetime... They gave me a 'joke' diploma (again: lol) to confirm that I had completed
the ""the prescribed course of radiation therapy"" ""with the highest degree of courage,
determination and good nature."" Heehee. Then, I met with the nurse, PA (who kept
addressing me as ""Wilma"" or ""Willow), and finally Dr. Patel. We once again seemed to
have some misunderstanding about the spots that were to be radiated (I'm sure he
radiated the right spot -- post-surgical radiation -- especially as he was basing much of
what he was doing on imaging -- but I may write to Dr. Bettegowda to be ultra-sure and
to assuage anxiety that I'm sure is at play here). He confirmed that all went well, that he
estimates there's a 15% chance of my brain cancer recurring, that I'll have an MRI in
three months unless I become symptomatic before that (worsening headaches, vision
troubles etc.), that there's really nothing much else for me to do as far as radiation goes.
The entire visit took about an hour. Jackie was kind enough to take me/pick me up and
as usual we managed to get in both a good conversation and a cappuccino at Café
Lemont (with thanks to the ""cappuccino fairies,"" Kathryn and Isabelle!). I rested and read
for a while when I returned home, and was then at my desk the entire afternoon, happily.
Weekly chemo (Taxol) will start up again, here, next week. I hope to speak with Dr.
Beavis soon about the treatment plan going forward, and about whether there might be
any clinical trials for me to enroll in. The effects of not having had chemo in so long while
we dealt with the brain issue (quite a detour!) are unclear to me. Thank goodness my
last OC scan, benefitting from the clinical trial, was stable.
I'm reading a good book: _The Beauty of Dusk,_ by Frank Bruni, which recounts the
struggles of this former NYTimes restaurant critic and current op-ed columnist with
sudden near blindness brought on by a stroke. It's a book about learning to make
adjustments, to live with uncertainty, to find open doors to compensate for the closed
ones. One takeaway I like is the importance of humor in these totally eccentric,
unprecedented situations (Monty Python plastic helmet, anyone?). Bruni writes very
nicely so it's an engaging read, and I'm ripping through it. 
Very much looking forward to my mother coming to visit next week! I will be glad for the
company.
I had a lovely birthday. The whole day was punctuated by greetings from friends and
family near and far -- texts, emails, FB messages, cards and gifts, a gorgeous bouquet, a
donation to José Andres' World Central Kitchen in my name, phone calls. Each one
brought a smile to my face. I am trying to respond to each in some fashion (have
responded to all the texts). Please bear with me. I am so appreciative of the well wishes
                    
and attention and outpouring of caring!
I also spent the day 'beautifying' my home for a gathering of about 20 local friends who
have been particularly kind and helpful over the past several years, throughout my
health ordeal, and who have never shied away from getting 'down and dirty' with me
when the going got tough. Again, I felt so blessed to receive this help and kind, non-
pitying connection when *I really needed it.* So the party was meant both to thank all
these wonderful folks (only two could not attend) and to celebrate. Everyone seemed to
have a blast; I think we were all happy to enjoy some maskless socializing (we all tested
beforehand and no one fell ill) after so many Covid restrictions and self-restrictions. We
all seemed to enjoy, as well, putting on our 'party clothes' after months in yoga and
sweat pants in front of Zoom. Therefore, I put quite a bit of thought into my outfit,
ordering a new 'party dress' (on sale) from my favorite Parisian clothier (Anne-Elisabeth),
buying some new makeup (my favorite sales guy at Ulta, Josh, the one who wears drag
show makeup and is himself immersed in drag culture), helped me pick out a bright pink
Mac lipstick, shimmery pale pink nail polish from OPI (called ""Princesses Rule!""), fake
eyelashes (for the first time *ever;* just felt like trying them as I'm hairless now), and an
eyebrow enhancer. I teased my newer wig so it looked quite nice and wavy. I wore the
perfume from my mom, Jo Malone's Sambac and Marigold, which is divine and which I
would have bought myself. I truly did look well and happy; as it happened, I felt well that
day and was certainly happy to be surrounded by friends all enjoying the celebration. I
prepared a 'groaning' dessert table with both savory (cheeses, pâté, sausage) and sweet
treats (cake, chocolate strawberries, homemade Tahini cookies, lemon cake from Breads
Bakery in NY, candy, fruit salad w/homemade whipped cream etc.), wines, liqueurs etc.
Cake, from a fairly new local baker (The Cakeshop by Tati) was extraordinary, and lots of
people photographed it before I cut it. I was glad for the opportunity for folks to meet
those they didn't know. Helen and Greg, off to Paris the next day, came over a bit early
to help me set up while the amazing Maria (with some help from her Greg) cleaned up
for me as I was starting to flag.
Everyone told me how good I looked. I wish that correlated with prognosis. While near
death *does* look, well, near death, per Dr. Beavis, I know that my outward appearance
is to some extent misleading. Even Dr. Beavis once said: ""It's surprising, you could cross
the path of someone very ill w/cancer in the grocery store and have no idea anything
was wrong."" I do want readers to hold onto this lest I be accused of 'false advertising' in
any way. Clearly the OC/brain cancer double whammy is not an ideal scenario. *But* I
was happy to dress up in my party dress + new makeup (w/great pink faux pearl
dangling cocktail earrings to match!) and revel in the celebration. Every day a blessing.
And I made it to 63!

265,"Now that radiation is finished it's back to chemo for the ovarian cancer, after a hiatus of
well over a month as the brain issue was resolved. Instead of viewing the resumption of
chemo as 'regression,' I consider it simply the next phase in treatment of a chronic
condition. Thursday I had blood drawn; there were no red flags to delay the start of
chemo. My bloodwork looked fine. I also met with Dr. Patel on Thursday. I was happy to
see him. After a rocky start a few years ago, when I found him rather brusque and
'unrelatable,' we have developed a warm relationship as we've gotten to know each
other better. He showed me MRI scans of my brain where I saw, for the first time, the
large tumor that was constricting the left side of my cerebellum - yikes. He said he
thought I was doing well for my situation, meaning that I'm mobile, driving, have
recovered well from the brain operation etc. Dr. Patel (still) refuses to pronounce on life
span, refrains from quantifying. He said that it will depend entirely on a) whether the
cancer has progressed to other organs or has simply progressed in the abdomen and b)
the ability of the chemo medication (Taxol) to control the cancer. While this initially
made me feel better than Dr. Beavis' prognosis, I was also starting to realize that the
cancer had to progress from my abdomen to my brain *somehow.* Bloodstream? Lymph
nodes? Will this happen again? This thought, coupled with Dr. Beavis' early statement
about my cancer being particularly aggressive, in fact made me worry more. Dr. Patel
                    
always advises me not to fetishize the CA125 number (""It's just a number""). At the same
time, I know he is committed to helping me, agreeing heartily when I said: ""If you
continue to treat me, I'll continue to fight"" -- or something like that. When I brought up
travel -- Paris is on my mind big time -- he encouraged me to go sooner rather than later,
for example, before my next scans for him (in two months) and, of the brain, for
radiation oncology (three months). This is what I had been thinking too, I would simply
need to think through some contingency plans if I start to feel unwell there (I have
enough Parisian friends to be able to garner a wealth of doctors' recommendations). I
was grateful that Dr. Patel had also called me a few weeks ago simply to check in, and
that I saw two of my favorite nurses when I was at his office, both of whom were very
kind, knew about my neurosurgery, and had lots of encouraging words for me.
The next morning my neighbor Janis drove me to chemo. I'll be having weekly Taxol
infusions (or rather three weeks on, one week off) for one hour, preceded (or
accompanied by) infusions of saline solution, Decadron (a steroid), anti-nausea medicine
and Benadryl (which usually knocks me out immediately). I was taking Taxol during the
clinical trial along with another drug, Fostamatinib (the combination of the two was the
'trial' aspect). As mentioned, my having had brain surgery now makes me ineligible for
most trials. Two of my favorite nurses, Tracey and Brynn, administered my infusion, and
were super kind to me. We enjoyed catching one another up on our lives and I showed
them some of the pictures of my fabulous birthday cake! Jackie picked me up and drove
me home w/a detour to Café Lemont to pick up a cappuccino. I rested for most of the
afternoon, reading a Gary Shteyngart novel that Michael had recommended to me, _Our
Country Friends_ (excellent, love his gift for wit and satire! Another novel that makes me
laugh out loud).
Surprisingly, I didn't sleep well, waking at around 4:30 this morning and sleeping just a
bit after that. I was tired, but also at times worried about my health, thinking about
things I had to do, etc. Hopefully I'll sleep better tonight. I'm very much looking forward
to my mother visiting for a part of this coming week. I'll have chemo again next Friday,
plus a visit with my PCP, Dr. Damaske. Will also televisit with Dr. Beavis this Wednesday
and will be eager to speak with her.
Overall, though, feeling ok. Sure glad I don't have to deal with the host of stomach woes
of the first half-year leading to my second, Jan. 2020 surgery (fistula repair): stomach
drainage bags, ultra-strong antibiotics, multiple stomach blockages, several failed
stomach plug procedures, many trips to Hopkins. All is well on that front!
One day at a time.
Be well, everyone.",4,neutral,0.42657545,0.011730981,0.009111404,0.21718518,0.26458436,0.42657545,0.0477223,0.0230903
266,"I see I haven't provided any updates in a while, partly as I was hosting my mother for the
better part of last week. Since then, I've had one chemo infusion -- Taxol -- which was
surprisingly 'untaxing.' My blood counts looked stable aside from a slightly elevated
bilirubin count. My friend Jackie picked me up from chemo and we returned to my house
for a Friday pre-dinner snack along with my friend Martina, bearing adorable plants that
flowered from seeds from a bag of lemons I had in the fridge. The get-together was also
the pretext for Jackie and Martina to meet my mother (in Martina's case, to meet her for
a second time as they had met at an MLA convention a long time ago). Earlier in the
week, my friend Helen also came over to visit with me and my mom; we had all enjoyed
a lovely lunch outdoors at the Ale House last summer, along with my friends Kathryn
(w/whom I enjoyed another *indoors* Ale House lunch this last week) and John. In any
event, the chemo did not tire me out excessively, and I was able to take a long drive
Saturday after I had put my mother on the Megabus back to the city.
I also had a post-op visit with my PCP, Dr. Damaske, and a video visit with Dr. Beavis and
nurse Justin Mahonsky, who had worked with me when I was participating in the clinical
trial. Our hour-long meeting was very useful, as always, and I suppose a bit sobering.
Both told me I looked ""amazing"" (I'll cling to every shred of my vanity for as long as I
can!). After my two scans (brain and pelvis/abdomen/chest) in about two months, Dr.
Beavis would like to add Avastin to my chemo cocktail, as it has been shown to make
Taxol work better. As you may recall, a potential side effect of Avastin is bowel
perforation, which I *may* be even more susceptible to as in March 2020 (just as COVID
hit) I had a long operation to repair a fistula between my bowel and abdomen. However,
as the number of viable treatment options 'dwindles' (my word, which Dr. Beavis found
apt), the risk/reward calculus must be reassessed with that in mind. Since I asked Dr.
Beavis, in this same conversation, how my 'demise' would likely 'go down,' she told me
that it would entail running out of viable treatment options. At that point, a likely (but not
definite) way death would occur would be loss of appetite (how ironic!) as tumors begin
to colonize the bowel, causing obstruction. Her recent suggestion of a potential lifespan
of ""six months to two years"" (while of course with the added caveat that these are
averages, there are outliers, each case can be different etc.) made me tell her and Justin
that I was ""mad"" about this (why wouldn't I be? It sucks!). But then I felt guilty towards
Dr. Beavis, whom I feared might think I was mad at her, so I wrote her a note to clarify.
She understood completely - she must get this all the time from patients.
Indeed, fear and anger are fairly new components of my emotional vocabulary right now,
despite my efforts to allay them and my firm intent to maintain a posture of gratitude
and happiness (I told my therapist today that I felt ""it would be a crime"" for me not to
remain positive, although she thought the word 'crime' was a bit strong...). On my
brother's recommendation, I just bought Fear: Essential Wisdom for Getting through the
Storm by Thich Nhat Hanh, and look forward to reading it now that I'm between two
                    
Shteyngarts. I also want to read Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of a Life
Interrupted by Suleika Jaouad, a bestselling NYTimes author who wrote ""The Isolation
Journals"" for the Times when she was a 22-year-old leukemia survivor (her cancer has
just recurred at age 33). I'm interested in what she has to write about creativity and the
special (sacred?) nature of these 'life interruptions.' In the meantime, rereading my blog
(actually editing it into user-friendly shape), time with friends and family, buds on trees,
cooking and more are proving therapeutic and keeping me 'positive' (I really don't know
what the appropriate word is here...).
I have a big, complicated decision to make about whether or not I'll go to Paris during an
off week for chemo. I won't write too much about it here because it's a fraught decision
that I'm still contemplating and that seems to have taken on existential dimensions for
me (while I still have a niggling feeling of 'first-world problems' with so much crisis
occurring in the world). I change my mind every day. My doctors are presenting this to
me as a 'bucket list' item, for which I have a very small window of opportunity. I'm very
tempted to flip this script and hold out for a wider window, simply out of cockiness. After
all, both Dr. Patel and Dr. Damaske refuse to pronounce on lifespan, stressing that each
case is individualized and really depends on how effective the medication is. Reward v.
risk: spending time with beloved friends, returning to meaningful places (a bench in the
gardens of the Palais-Royal; the marché d'Aligre; my old apartments beginning in Passy),
touching base with work contacts, eating favorite foods in favorite places. For now, I'd
like to eschew the idea of a 'victory lap' or, rather, 'valedictory,' much as I'd like to
sidestep the 'bucket list' idea. Risks: coming COVID surge in Europe (??), falling ill
w/cancer or COVID in Paris (potentially disastrous on many levels), neurosurgeon's
suggestion that the jet flight could make me 'slightly uncomfortable' but would not cause
damage to the work he did (!), uncertainty about whether I could have the experience I
wanted rather than something else, perhaps tinged with a bit of worry; potential
necessity of making the trip myself (which normally would not be a problem but that
leaves me a bit anxious right now); unease of certain family members. I need to gather
some additional information (have queried Dr. Bettegowda about just how uncomfortable
my head might be from the flight; need to follow up with my friends who still *might*
want to make the trip, as we had planned from the start). I believe there's no right or
wrong decision here; whatever I decide, I will create the optimal conditions around it.
Btw, Drs. Patel and Damaske are strongly in favor of my Paris idea; Dr. Beavis sounded
more cautious but would support the idea as well. She doesn't want me to wind up in the
hospital in Paris.
My mother and I had a lovely time taking drives to neighboring towns, lunching,
shopping, feeding the ducks in Talleyrand Park, talking, watching _West Side Story_ (an
American masterpiece; mediocre movie) etc. It was nice to have her company. I'll attach
a few pics.
                    
I'm very much looking forward to lunch with the ""III Cs"" this week and to spending time
with other survivors, at different points in our treatment, survivorship etc. I'm less
looking forward to having an X-ray (likely on Thursday) of my left hip, which has felt a bit
sore recently (but which I'm hoping 'just' has a touch of arthritis). When I mentioned it to
Drs. Beavis and Damaske, I had in mind that my dear grade school friend Debbie's
cancer had spread at one point into her hip, nearly incapacitating her (not my case in the
least). Much as it's a bit scary, I felt I needed to 'come clean' about this and not delay
further. Fingers crossed. I also had my fourth COVID shot today, a bit of extra protection
for us immunocompromised folk. Hoping not to experience flu-like effects from it. So far
so good.
Since I'll be tethered to my chemo pole once a week (three weeks on, one week off),
please come visit me this spring or summer, provided I feel ok. Am I being pathetic and
needy here or simply stating my needs and desires explicitly? Or invite me to come visit
you or meet you halfway, if it's not too far. Local friends: I will continue to reach out too,
of course. We have: breweries, farmers markets, farm to table restaurants, a network of
creeks, hiking trails, state parks, Creamery ice cream, a local music scene, a beautiful
arboretum, roadside fruit and vegetable stands, Amish farms and hamlets, antiques
stores and, chez moi, a private bedroom and bathroom upstairs (""Ben's lair"" when he's
here), comfy condo, summer kitchen. My grad school besties are coming out in late April,
after I return from the city (where I'll get to cheer Ben on in the first Brooklyn half-
marathon). But consider a country getaway!

267,"Since last week my abdomen has begun to make itself known, with significant discomfort
in my stomach and other points in my abdominal area. New cancer? Scar tissue?
Blockage? Dr. Patel ordered a CT scan for tomorrow afternoon, never pleasant (long
procedure, four hour fast, drink that tastes like greasy melted chalk) but necessary to
find out what's going on. Luckily, there was a cancellation tomorrow afternoon at Gray's
Woods; otherwise I would have needed to wait until mid-April for the scan. Never a dull
moment. Of course, this makes me very anxious. I received the result of the hip x-ray
but as a non-medical professional am having trouble parsing it. The bottom line seems to
be that an MRI or CT-scan is needed for further clarification. And some of the discomfort
there may simply be due to cartilage loss and not necessarily new cancer, as I
suspected.
My sleep last night was fairly atrocious. I awoke every hour or two with horrible leg
cramps, most likely due to dehydration because of diarrhea (tmi?). A combination of leg
massages, heating pads, numerous glasses of water etc. finally relieved me of the
cramps but I feel slightly zombie-like today. Oh well. The night before I slept well. I
rested a bit and got myself a cappuccino and felt better.
I am trying to get on top of my anxiety. Sometimes it's hard. I'm reading _Fear: Essential
Wisdom for Getting through the Storm,_ by Thich Nhat Hanh but it's not helping! Phrases
like ""there is no death, only continuation"" really don't resonate with me. I do believe that
each individual lives on after death, indirectly, in the fruits of the actions they performed
on earth, in their accomplishments, in their progeny etc. but this is in no way comparable
to having the physical person around. It is a memory-based connection, at least that's
how I'm conceiving of it now. Mindful breathing, mindfulness, grounding oneself in the
present moment etc., which this Buddhist Zen master recommends, are all useful
practices. But I'm simply not finding his book that useful, so maybe I'll return to B.J.
Miller's Ted Talk about ""what really matters at the end of life."" Maybe I'm just not cut out
to be a Buddhist or even a JewBu. I could use  more Zen in my life, but my at times
paralyzing anxiety needs to make way for it.
Therefore, no decision about a Paris trip yet until I get a handle on what may or may not
be going on with me physically.
No other major developments to report from last week. My Taxol infusion, once again,
did not knock me out last Friday - something to be thankful for at least. I have a week off
from chemo this week as my white blood cells replenish. Was at the dentist for cleaning
and for Steve to look at some bonding work that needs repair. Otherwise, always a high
point was lunch with the ""III Cs,"" four other survivors whose company feels safe and
uplifting. Deb, a twelve(?)-year survivor who has been in treatment nearly continuously
and has outlived all predictions, is an inspiration. Felt equally gratified attending the
                    
Alumni Association awards dinner at the Penn Stater Saturday night with Morgane, a
graduate student whose dissertation I direct, and her husband, Aaron. Morgane is one of
thirteen recipients university- wide of the Alumni Association Dissertation Award, which
recognizes the quality of her research. She's an exceptional student and lovely person
and I'm happy to have any small role to play in her success. Sunday morning Maria and I
drove out to Elk Creek Café, a cool farm to table restaurant/brewery out in Amish country
and, with the church-going buggies rolling by, we enjoyed brunch with Mar and Jessica,
two other friends we hadn't seen in a while (Mar's painting are on exhibit at the café).
Our former long-time dean (27 years?), Susan Welch, died last night of liver cancer.
When I was a rank and file faculty member and department head, Susan was always 'the
dean,' a slightly formidable figure. She worked indefatigably to raise the profile of the
College of the Liberal Arts at Penn State, and succeeded. She was a prominent political
scientist who recently began working on the Holocaust. Her legacy is remarkable.
Sunday a building will be dedicated in her honor (sadly, she will not have made it to the
inauguration ceremony). Through our shared cancer journeys, though, we became closer
the past few years -- lunches out, email, soup deliveries, sharing details of our
treatment. We bonded. I saw her a few weeks ago when I brought her some butternut
squash soup. She looked quite frail but was headed to the office to work! And there goes
that 'whoosh' of cancer close by, again. I hope she had a peaceful death, the death she
wanted.
Also had a long overdue zoom catch-up with my dear first cousin, Julie Eagle-Cardo, the
one I was thrown into the crib with when we were both a few weeks old. We've been
thick as thieves our entire lives, from commuting between the city and Fairfield County,
CT, when we were teens to enjoy adventuresome weekends, to travelling together in
Europe, to experiencing milestones at the same time, to having sons, to producing
reams of correspondence and emails over the years. I never had a biological sister but
Julie comes close. May you be so lucky as to have such a close relative/'forever friend'
too.
Finally, several people have inquired about the Stride and Thrive event for which I
organized a team the past two years to help raise funds for KEGOS (Hopkins' Kelly
Gynecologic Oncology Service). Our great team, both in State College and elsewhere (in
the States and abroad), ran/walked on clear June days while sporting our #willapower
shirts. I just got off the phone with one of this year's organizers, who seemed to want
feedback from me as my fundraising efforts have been so successful the past two years.
Long story short: they are not opting for the run/walk format as they have the past two
years (which itself had replaced a 'cast of thousands' event in Baltimore, which Covid put
an end to). Instead, they will be hosting a garden party in Maryland on June 26th. A
month before that, though, they will organize a run/walk, similar to the Stride and Thrive
of years past. To be honest, they seem a bit disorganized and behind schedule. But there
*will* be an opportunity for fundraising once they work out some blips in their website.
                    
All this to say that I hope to raise funds for KEGOS once again this year, and will share
details, but must wait for Hopkins to get its act together first!",2,fear,0.9014649,0.0040873806,0.007970589,0.9014649,0.0024561605,0.04588975,0.02836135,0.009769802
268,"As for the title word of this blog post, I just like it. It also contains the word 'gris,' which is
how I was feeling a few days this week. And I love that blue-green patina formed by
oxidation. Confused yet?
I spent so much time at Gray's Woods this past week that it was really starting to
depress me -- until I remembered that the place is full of medical professionals whose job
it is to *help* patients and hopefully make them feel better. I also feel innately
compassionate towards people with serious health challenges. My house cleaner, Missy,
told me yesterday that she has a brain tumor (benign yet growing) and other health
issues, and that her fiancé has cancer. Her parents were both alcoholics. She is rural and
poor -- like many who live just beyond State College -- and works hard to make it. I wish
her a happy day today, fishing with her granddaughter.
I had separate appointments at Gray's Woods for the first shingles vaccine (which I
wanted to make sure to get), a urine analysis (yep, I have *another* UTI, which hopefully
the antibiotics will take care of; must keep ultra-hydrated at all times), and a CT-scan (oh
yes, I think I was there a fourth time, to pick up a disk with CT-scan imaging on it,
because they were unable to burn a disk while I was there. This is really pretty lame,
considering that, over the past few years, Geisinger has *never been able* to forward
imaging directly to Hopkins; I always have to pick up a disk and then upload the imaging
myself).
Anyhoo...
The CT-scan did not reveal a stomach blockage! I am so relieved. I went on a liquid diet
for a few days and that seemed to help. It's hard for me to parse the results of the
radiologist's report but Dr. Patel called me briefly to discuss (I'm not convinced he looked
at the actual imaging, which I want him to, and which I'll discuss with him this Friday
when I see him). Besides the results pertaining to the bowel, the scan revealed some
decrease in size in certain cancerous masses and lymph nodes and some increase in
other lymph nodes (which is what chemo is for...). I don't know, though, whether the net
result is an increase or a decrease in cancerous mass and exactly where these nodes are
situated (they had names I did not recognize; I suppose I could look them up but I'd
prefer to let Dr. Patel or Dr. Beavis, who has been away and will return this week,
explain). Dr. Patel said that the most enlarged lymph node was in my abdomen but that
it ""shouldn't bother me a lot."" I also still don't understand why I have marked discomfort
at the bottom tip of my right rib cage (the CT-scan revealed nothing of concern in my
liver). More points to bring up with the doctors this week.
So...onward we go, with what sometimes seems like a ticking time bomb inside me. Not
easy.
                    
All the medical 'stuff' was at the root of a dark hole I was plunged into, and couldn't get
out of, for about two-three days this past week. I was afraid that being mired in my
health issues was going to wipe out the memory of how much *fun* I certainly used to
be, and like to think I still am! I was feeling super-stuck and therefore doing nothing,
feeling paralyzed, when I still get on my case for every moment 'wasted.' 'My incredible
shrinking' world depressed me. And so did not feeling well, of course.
What helped lift me out of my gloom was the support of friends! May sound corny to say,
but true. ""Be of good cheer,"" writes Whitman in _Song of Myself._ ""We will not desert
you."" A few texts reminded me that I am not alone.While opening gifts that arrived
simultaneously from two wonderful friends and reading the note from one, I *literally*
felt my spirits lift and I could hear myself saying ""Awwww!"" and smiling (I do want to
clarify here - not that it's necessary -- that I am not ""holding out"" for gifts, nor do I
consider them *at all* a more tangible display of friendship. I am certainly not that kind
of materialist, either! Gifts are lovely [thank you for the tea, Martina!] But a kind word,
visit, call -- or simply taking the time to read what I've posted -- is really a mood-lifter).
In any event, my dear old friend and colleague, Jim, sent me _The Book of Joy,_
conversations between the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu. I can't wait to read this book,
as Thich, no matter how noble a man he was (and I'm sure he was), is simply not doing it
for me. And my college friend Wilson, w/whom I've reconnected, sent me blueberry
preserves and pear compote that he canned himself from fruit on his farm. He sent me
the kindest note, too. Wilson, thank you so much for lifting my spirits and I will write you
soon! Thinking of the right words to you in response...
I'm feeling generally ok. It looked like the sun was out this morning so I got myself out of
bed, got a cappuccino at Café Lemont and then drove to Tati's cakeshop, the one that
produced my stupendous birthday cake, for some muffins. Will take another drive this
afternoon to view early spring in the country; it will be calming. Dinner tomorrow night
with my friend Maria, and thank you, Monique, for coming to dinner at my place after my
tiring CT-scan experience.
I did enjoy a lovely dinner at the Tavern with Dallas, a former undergraduate student
who I taught *thirty* years ago! We lost touch for a while but have since reconnected as
friends. We talked about Henri Vever (whose 1898 diary he read, and I signed with a
dedication to Dallas) and many other things French, essential oils, life, work and much
else. Dallas is returning to French after varied and interesting first (and second) careers,
substituting and perhaps eventually teaching in a private school in his home of Reading,
PA. He was kind enough to share that he remembered I always dressed up for class (at
least in the early days!), in my cute Parisian skirts and heels and jewelry, and that it was
always fun to see what I'd turn up to class wearing. Love this memory! Dallas (who must
love good smelly stuff like me), also gifted me a lovely lilac candle from Etsy with a
                    
heady odor; that smell will always remind me of the end of the semester, when the lilacs,
as if on cue, bloom on the path besides ""Deans' Walk,"" a row of office in Sparks Building).
There is a line from the prayerbook we use for shabbat services that came to mind: ""We
are loved by everlasting love. We are [?] by arms we cannot see.""
Ben - who turns 27 on Monday! - will be coming 'home' in about two weeks, around
Passover. Then, if all goes well, I'll head to NY later this month to watch him run in the
first Brooklyn Marathon. He graduates next month from NYU with an M.S. in Data Science
and is narrowing in on some worthy job possibilities. He and a friend are off to a
butchering class in Brooklyn today, a present from their girlfriends - I asked for pictures
of these two bros sipping a beer after butchering an animal -- so Brooklyn.
I wanted to remember a strange dream I had: Michael (my ex-husband) said he was
about to join a (the?) squash team. People in his household were also about to embark
on a sale of Girl Scout cookies. I inquired about purchasing thin mints, my favorites. In
the next scene,  I was dancing with Jason Momoa (not unpleasant!); he was behind me
and we were kind of loping/dancing along and having a conversation at the same time.
He expressed a wish to be invited to my house (but I think it was my mother's house?)
for a stay. I alluded to the previous guest, who had had drug issues (somehow conflated
in my dream with my ex-boyfriend Gregory). End of dream. Wonder if the final part might
echo the death of Taylor Hawkins, a musician I long found charismatic and talented; I
had listened to many interviews with Taylor and Dave Grohl, although I really didn't
know the Foo Fighters' music very well. What a pity.",6,surprise,0.45569438,0.0043997495,0.010125329,0.0066920584,0.06237887,0.13272367,0.327986,0.45569438
269,"Dear friends,
For the third year in a row, I am privileged to be raising funds for KEGOS (the Kelly
Gynecologic Oncology Center) at Johns Hopkins, and its programs. I would be honored if
you would consider making a donation in any amount, to help women like myself (and
including myself!) thrive while confronted with often insidious diseases. The website for
donations is: ttps://runsignup.com/Race/127044/Donate/Qq4CULKMK4y6KGMx
The website has changed a bit since last year. If you are able to make a donation to my
team (#willapower) as opposed to a donation to my individual fundraising account (there
may be a button on the page for this purpose), please do. All donations go directly to
Johns Hopkins.
If you have any questions/problems, please ask!
The format for the culminating event has changed a bit. This year a garden party for
survivors is planned at an estate in Maryland, on June 26th. I *believe* that one month
before that, on May 26th, there will be a 'fitness challenge' similar to the 1k walk/5 mile
run some of us have participated in the past few years in locations as far flung as State
College, New York, Philly, Baltimore, Michigan, California, Massachusetts, and Japan! I
will let you know as plans for this event develop and, as/if they do, look forward to
(re)assembling team #willapower for the occasion!

generously to the Stride and Thrive/Reunite and Reignite Fundraiser for KEGOS: Phil,
Clare, Susan Wolfert (whom I don't believe I know), Kathryn, Denise, Helen, June (my
cousin), Julie (my cousin), Sharon (aka mom), Jane G. We are nearing 20% of our
fundraising goal. The link to the donations page is in the entry just before this one.
Thank you in advance for helping women like myself combat ovarian, uterine and other
'below the belt' cancers.
I've appreciated the blessing of a relatively 'normal' (all things considered etc.) week,
meaning no unexpected medical visits, subsiding abdominal pain, a suspected UTI that
turned out not to be one, decent energy level etc. This meant that I was able to fully
enjoy great convo and brunch with Martina at the Naked Egg Cafe (a cute local place);
drinks with Katerina at Gigi's (a mocktail for me), and dinner at the Ale House (packed to
the gills; this town always confounds me that way) with Lisa S. Taxol continues to treat
me fairly kindly; I did crash for almost two hours after returning from my infusion around
noon yesterday (but I attribute that in part to the early start time of my appointment
with Dr. Patel), A day after chemo, though, I feel relatively chipper, have a pot of chicken
soup simmering and may head out in search of horseradish (the Amish make a
                    
particularly pungent variety).
Per my appointment with Dr. Patel, things *seem* status quo; when I asked him whether
there had been a net increase or decrease in the amount of cancer in my body, he said it
was hard to tell. Because cancer cells mutate so efficiently, with the goal of 'outsmarting'
the chemo drugs, the Taxol may prove more effective against certain types of cancer
cells than against others. Also, he explained that different groups of cells have different
blood supplies -- at least that's what I understood. So treating these stealthy cells is
complicated indeed. He attributed the discomfort at the bottom tip of my right ribs to an
irritation of some sort, but I'm hoping that the Hopkins' radiologists will also offer their
analysis of the imaging. For now, then (and 'now' may mean a shorter or longer window,
as I've become used to planning for small increments of time), my situation seems
relatively stable (and I feel obliged to add that 'relatively' there!).
I'm looking forward to digging into _Between Two Kingdoms_ by Suleika Jouad (Jon
Batiste's wife), a compilation of the pieces she wrote for the _NYTimes_ as ""Life,
Interrupted"" when she was a twenty-two year old diagnosed with leukemia and then
recovering from it (sadly and unusually, her leukemia has recently recurred ten years
later). The book has been well reviewed and I'm interested to learn more about her
perspective and absorb any wisdom I can from it). Will start _The Book of Joy_ after that,
or maybe at the same time.
I've been wondering what people mean when they say they are 'inspired' by me. It
seems to me that if you want to live, you make that your goal and pursue it tenaciously.
Undergoing treatment for cancer is a *project.* Not everyone undertakes it tenaciously,
but wouldn't most people? If at some point I decide to refuse further treatment, will I still
'inspire' you? What about me inspires you? Do my actions inspire you to act or live
differently, to adjust your perspective or your values? I've actually received some pretty
interesting and often surprising answers to this question (my cousin Julie offered one,
having to do with my writing I believe, but I can't remember the particulars). I do
understand that for the seven or so 'thrivers' (a word I sometimes prefer to 'survivors')
reading my blog, including a few dealing with serious chronic illness and several in
treatment for cancer now or in the past, it is possible to empathize and draw strength
from the words of another person confronting a more or less analogous situation. But I'm
never sure what it might mean for others. Is it something people say -- reflecting a
tendency to heroize suffering -- or something that truly helps them on their journey?
I'm also confused by people who demur about discussing their problems with you
because they feel you 'have it much worse.' I don't understand what kinds of feelings
generate a statement like that. Some sort of guilt, I guess, but why? Everyone's frame of
reference is different. If it's a problem for you, it's a problem. There are people worse off
than me; if they were my friends, I wouldn't let that deter me from sharing my troubles
with them. If you sincerely feel guilty about talking about your problems because you're
                    
afraid I might find them trivial, I will let you know that. I will also let you know if I need to
talk about what's going on with me in terms of my health issues (I will likely calibrate the
amount/type of information I share depending on my interlocutor). But I don't need to
talk about them all the time; it becomes boring after a while and I'm still more than
capable of friendships based on exchange (I thrive on them, actually). As most of you
know, I also abhor any kind of statement even slightly tinged with pity, which doesn't
mean ignoring that I have a serious illness that is simply a *fact* of my life right now.
Anyhoo...
I am so excited about Ben coming 'home' on W for a visit over the holiday. I hope we'll
have a meaningful seder and a good meal (there must be matzah ball soup! and brisket!
and lotsa matzah! and tzimmes!). Whatever 'narrow place of bondage' (mizraim) --as
Egypt was for the Israelites -- you find yourself in, whether physical, emotional, spiritual,
psychological -- I wish you a way out of it. I have found several prayers for Ukraine that I
will incorporate. While I hope at times to be released from the 'bondage' of serious
illness, I know for sure that opportunities for joy in life abound and are present for me.",3,joy,0.69724584,0.006040389,0.008538672,0.006231609,0.69724584,0.25679857,0.008306001,0.016838951

It's a busy time -- which I hope is a good thing as opposed to a depleting one -- but
wanted to share the news that I *have* decided to go to Paris for a week, May 4-12. One
deciding factor was the wonderful offer by a very dear high school friend, Jill Morey
Gaines, to accompany me on the trip! Jill has proved an exceptional, highly supportive
friend throughout my illness, driving out here from Princeton, NJ (where one of her three
daughters lives) a year or two ago to lift my spirits, help me out around the house and
town, and drive me to Hopkins if necessary (it turned out not to be, at the last minute).
But then again, Jill is the friend who, after my parents got divorced many years ago
(when we were in high school), invited me to spend the weekend in Atlantic City in an
apartment owned by the family of another friend, Debbie (of blessed memory). They
were the only two friends who reached out to me in such a direct, kind way, and that
seaside weekend with my two friends was a balm for me, as I recall. Jill went to a French
school before joining us at Nightingale for high school, speaks French, has been to Paris,
and understands the adjustments I may need to make on this trip (ie sadly, likely no
more 15 km strolls around Paris and perhaps a mid-afternoon nap on some days when
my stamina is low). She said she'd be content to sit in a café together for several hours
and people watch (as would I) and knows that there are a few friends I may need to
                    
spend a bit of time with solo. I can't think of a better travel companion, in fact. She's a
lot of fun! And we're totally on the same page when it comes to shopping, eating out,
some light museum going etc. Merci, Jill :). Jill will fly from her home near LA at the
beginning of May, spend a night or more at her apartment in NYC, then meet me at
Newark for our flight (let's just say we're both pampering ourselves throughout the trip).
We'll return on the same flight on the 12th, then I'll catch a connecting flight from
Newark to State College, just in time for chemo the next day...
A particularly luminous spring day in State College also, somehow, made me yearn for
the luminosity and visual gorgeousness of Paris in the spring. One *can* feel a deep
emotional connection to a place, and I want to be there, sitting on a bench in the Palais-
Royal, strolling the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, spending a lazy afternoon in the Tuileries
or Jardin du Luxembourg chatting with a friend, eating a baguette sandwich in the place
des Vosges, people watching over a café crème on the _terrasse_  of a café.
Jill and I are staying at Hôtel Le Mareuil in the 11e, a nice-looking boutique hotel Jill's
travel agent identified for us. I had wanted to stay right in the Marais, but the hotel I like
there (Grand Malher) is fully booked. We won't be far, though, from the 'haut Marais,'
République, the trendy Oberkampf neighborhood, even the Canal Saint-Martin, and the
marché Richard-Lenoir, so we're well-situated. 
I've started making some plans with friends (Jill and I will have a reunion with one of our
32 high school classmates, ie 'sisters,' Christina, and her delightful husband, Vincent). If I
haven't contacted you yet, Paris friends, I will do so within the next day or two! 
Restaurant recs welcome, btw. I do have my favorites, of course, but it will have been
*three* years since my last visit, and the dining scene can morph rapidly.
I understand that my plans could still be upended. There is so much uncertainty
surrounding my illness. Between now and May 4th, I could still experience a stomach
blockage, headaches, or other worrisome cancer-related symptoms. And then there's
COVID. I've asked a few friends to supply doctors' names/numbers there in case of
emergency. I will take all the precautions. Hopefully, I'll have the will(a)power to make
some necessary modifications to diet, alcohol intake etc. while in Paris -- many
temptations there, of course, as I search for the ultimate _tarte au citron_ (and have a
good idea of where to find it), and I again need to chart a middle ground between
indulgence and the real care with which I must treat my body. Oy!
I am feeling generally ok these days -- something like a modified 'honeymoon period' as
I've experienced with OC before -- chemo went smoothly yesterday -- and just need to
stay well during a busy upcoming stretch -- always need to find that balance between
taking advantage of the well-feeling periods and not overdoing it. Ben is here for a few
days and we enjoyed a lovely seder last night with all sorts of yummy food that I cooked
                    
over a two-week period (I'll perhaps write another entry about that). Thursday or Friday,
after chemo, we will most likely drive into the city, where I'll spend about a week. On the
agenda is hanging out with my mother (who's recovering from a fall in the street,
fortunately *not* resulting in any broken bones but still a badly sprained knee and ankle
and nasty bruises); lunch with two more wonderful high school friends, one of whom I
haven't seen in a few years outside Zoom; part of a day with Mitchel, my very dear
college friend of 45 years, who will be visiting the States from Nice; if all goes well (ie
somewhat iffy Achilles heel permitting), the first Brooklyn half-marathon, in which Ben
will be running; a little shopping for Paris. Then back to State College for the arrival of
my three grad school pals (""les filles""), Isa, Vinni and Shanny, for one night chez moi and
a second at Bedford Springs resort and spa in Bedford, PA (about a 1.5 hour drive from
here). Following our nascent tradition that began at Kripalu yoga center a few years ago,
we'll seek answers to our pressing questions from Shanny's crystal pendulum, act much
younger and sillier than our age, collapse into gales of giggles, take goofy selfies of
ourselves, have slumber parties, reminisce, and share some serious talk too. A few days
after the pals leave I head to Paris. Kooky planning? Too much? So far the efforts are
proving uplifting and not debilitating as it's all about fun, vibrancy and life as I like to live
it, taking it by the horns and riding it for all it's worth. And then there are those seeds
planted in the back of my mind by my medical team (whose members are generally
enthusiastic about my making this trip) about these weeks representing some sort of
'window of opportunity' that may or may not present itself again. Hence a
certain...franticness? Of course, I hope this episode won't end with a curtain falling on
the action, but I'm apprehensive about a potential upcoming change in chemo regimen
and some telltale scans, likely in June. Ah well, ""I'll think about it tomorrow.""",3,joy,0.8711045,0.0045415326,0.00020251321,0.01481037,0.8711045,0.015273181,0.06299031,0.03107759

Also: would any State College (or other?) peeps be available to drive me to Newark
airport on W 4 May to catch my 6:30 p.m. flight to Paris? On the return, I will fly from
Newark directly back to State College, but would really prefer to drive directly to Newark
on the 4th rather than getting there via NYC. The direct flight to Newark from SC will not
work out for me on the 4th. I realize this is a big ask but thought I'd try.
I haven't written in a while. There's been much activity recently. I'm trying to take
advantage of the proverbial ""window of opportunity"" my doctors have identified for me
to travel, see friends and family etc. This makes for a very busy time. Cancer time is so
strange. Because there is so much uncertainty surrounding my health, I am often
compelled to measure time in very short increments. Let me get through the day, the
week, two weeks. Long-range planning is tough. Cancer time also seems to unfold as it is
doing now: 'honeymoon periods' of intense activity v. periods of fallow time. I've had to
adjust to a completely different way of structuring my time (which is in part a feature of
retirement): the academic calendar, semesters, portions of semesters, school holidays
etc. used to structure my time. No longer.
Like Icarus' wings of feathers and wax, mine are flimsy, yet I still, often mistakenly,
expect that they will allow me to 'reach the sun,' to fulfill all my goals, realize my hopes
etc. It's not really a question of hubris in my case, but rather wishes, hopes, dreams, and
imaginings that things might be 'like before.' They can't, and at times I still rebel against
accepting this.  I almost passed out in a coffee shop near my mother's house yesterday,
due to a combination of feeling overheated in a small, crowded below ground coffee
shop, dehydrated, slightly nauseous, and tired from standing for about 15 minutes to
chat with a close friend I had run into in the coffee shop. Beyond this, my red blood cell
count is somewhat depressed from chemo.  This perfect storm forced me to slump down
into a chair, in a cold sweat, with my head on the table until I could get sufficient fluids
into me. The baristas called EMS! The nice EMS workers asked if I wanted to go to the
hospital, but I definitely wanted to avoid this. Instead, the friend I had run into (my
wonderful photographer friend Laurent, whom I've known for 41 years since he was my
student in Avignon and whom I seem to run into on the street every time I'm in the city)
insisted on walking me home, arm in arm, to make sure I was ok. I lay down for a while
when I got back to my mother's apartment and felt ok, but took it fairly easy for the rest
of the day.
                    
This morning I had planned to get up very early to head out to Brooklyn to see Ben run in
the Brooklyn half-marathon (the ostensible original purpose of this NY trip). But I slept
very poorly and had a bit of a stomach ache, so I gave up on that idea at about 6 a.m.
and wrote Ben to tell him. I was extremely disappointed not to be able to check out the
lively scene (20.000 runners!) and cheer Ben on, but feel I made the right decision,
especially foregoing standing amidst a huge crowd for hours.... My brother Ethan, who
had kindly agreed to meet me at Grand Army Plaza, did make it out there, snapping  a
pic of Ben as he ran past. Oh well. It's still hard to live with so much 'fomo,' and hard to
channel regret into acceptance rather than depression. Serenity is needed.
I'm feeling ok, tired, stomach a bit queasy, but ok. Every other night or so I seem to
sleep poorly and that is wretched. [p.s. For my friends I have plans to see in the city the
next two days, and then in State College, and then in Paris, I definitely want to meet up
with you - my friends are important to me - and feel well enough to do so. I just need to
not go too far afield and must get ample fresh air and water --- it's all good and I'll let
you know if that changes!]
Every day a gift, no matter what, must retain that. 
Have had some strange dreams recently. One featured my high school classmates, our
band of 32 'sisters,' several of whom I will be blessed to reunite with soon (lunch with
Eva and Zia tomorrow; trip to Paris with Jill; dinner in Paris with Jill and our classmate
Christina and her husband Vincent). In the dream I was late to an event at the
schoolhouse on 92nd street (depicted extremely realistically in the dream). I saw myself
running through the corridors and up the staircases of the school to get to the event,
some sort of ceremony in the auditorium (also appearing in exact detail!) in which my
class was participating or would be honored. Finally catching up to my class as it
processed into the auditorium in a compact group, I noticed that the classmates were all
stylishly dressed, yet I could really only see them from the back as I was following the
group. Christina (whom we'll see in Paris) was wearing a chic off the shoulder dress in a
colorful pattern. Another classmate was wearing a white suit (skirt/jacket) in a crepe-like
fabric. I looked good enough, but my outfit seemed *old-fashioned;* a maroon dress that
reached to the knees or below, hair done fairly stylishly but nothing like the others. So
there I was, *behind the times, of another era, frozen in time in some sense, hoping to
catch up, hoping not to be left back.* I don't want to leave these girlhood friends - the
dream was clear on that point.
Last night's dream: I'm in a house that belongs to me but is unfamiliar. It's luxurious:
tiling on the floor (as in an Italian villa), a long, elegant hallway with many rooms off it. I
am tasked with showing it to Christina B., one of my former undergraduate students
(who also participated in a trip I led to Paris). I was unfamiliar with the house and had
trouble finding the light switches so I could illuminate successive rooms and parts of the
house. The first room we came to off a long hallway turned out to belong to my former
                    
brother-in-law, Bruce (whose voice I may have heard 'offstage'). For some reason, today,
the Biblical verse ""In my father's house there are many rooms"" is stuck in my mind, but
I'm not sure why. The other 'half' of this dream (presenting a contrast, but it's vague in
my memory) had to do with hospitalization, procedures, medical equipment,
unpleasantness (and my connection to these), yet also a cake being left for me as a gift.
Paging Dr. Freud?
Ben came home for over a week, which was wonderful. We enjoyed a meaningful seder,
using a new (to us) Haggadah by Marcia Falk, which has a much more feminist, current,
'relatable' bent than our old school, ultra-patriarchal Haggadot (that instructs the 'master
of the house' to perform various  ritual actions). The Haggadah drew attention to the role
of women in the Exodus story and pondered why none of the women (except Miriam,
belatedly) are named, including Pharaoh's daughter, who raised Moses. The meal, which
I had worked on intermittently for about two weeks, was delicious, and we enjoyed
singing some traditional songs (and some less traditional ones), including ""Miriam's
Song,"" which we had introduced to Ben when he was little (he'll always know,
consequently, that a 'timbrel' is a tabmourine!). We also talked about the ""personal
mizrayim"" (""narrow places"") that we hope to be delivered from, and read a prayer for
Ukraine. The rest of the week Ben and I did our separate things -- he had class (online),
job interviews, homework etc. while I had plenty of tasks and work to take care of. I
introduced Ben to the movie ""The Woman in Gold"" so he could learn about the history of
looted art in Vienna, where he'll be headed next month to visit Sammi; we also checked
out several nights of NBA playoffs. He drove me to chemo, labs etc. and also to the city
this past Friday. I've always enjoyed the long car trips with Ben -- we listen to podcasts
(""The Daily"" and other NYTimes podcasts) and tunes, share lunch (the last of the matzah,
mine with avocado spread) at a picnic site off Route 80, and shoot the breeze. This is
where the best talks happen. :)
Another lesson from today: My son and my brother are here, and they will finish the race
for me.
Be well, everyone.

274,"[Hi everyone, I am in Paris right now, having a great time -- and so far Covid free,
yippee! -- but wanted to send this entry of which I wrote a draft on May 3, hoping to
finish before I left for France. The moving image changes quickly and the past several
weeks have been most eventful, but I did want to at least get a short post off before I
have a chance to write more fully when I'm back. It's a gorgeous day in Paris, and I'm off
to do a bit of present shopping before meeting my friend Doris in the Marais for lunch
outdoors at La Terrasse des Archives. Then later, a drink with my friend David Drach at
the Cafe La Perle and dinner with my ride or die travel companion, Jill, at Breizh Cafe
(among the best crepes in Paris, I'm told). As of today: Life is good!). XO
I wanted to write a quick update on the eve of my departure for Paris tomorrow. It's been
over a week since I've written. I do feel well enough to undertake the trip, despite all
manner of cancer-related symptoms. As per my labs, my magnesium levels were low so
Dr. Patel ordered magnesium infusions that wound up taking about five hours yesterday
and today. Diarrhea is still a problem (and a worry, for all the reasons - I have lots of
medication with me!). The past few days, I've also been having some discomfort on the
right side of my head (my 'bad' side): my skull feels stiff, tight and somewhat
constricted, I have some tenderness behind my ear and in a few other spots. The anxiety
that consumed me on Sunday abated considerably when one of the nurses messaged Dr.
Patel on Monday; he ticked off the telltale signs of brain cancer recurrence (searing
headaches, blurry vision, balance problems), of which I have been experiencing *none.*
Today he was in the office and was able to briefly come to the infusion room to examine
my head. He thinks my symptoms are related to post-op changes (yes, even after three
months) -- perhaps the formation of scar tissue, perhaps some inflammation. If I had told
him sooner, he said, he likely would have ordered an MRI out of an abundance of
caution, and we'll probably move my brain scan up from mid- to early-June or late May.
But I only began fixating on my skull a few days ago, despite less recent (and maybe
milder?) symptoms. Meanwhile, I will travel with a veritable pharmacy of meds -
Oxycodone, a steroid, antibiotic etc. in case I become symptomatic. Energy level is
pretty good. In the moments when I stop being anxious I can hardly contain my
excitement.
I feel like such a worry-wart. But please understand that very soon after my last trip to
Paris, three years ago, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I am nearly positive that I
had cancer already when in March 2019 I took eighteen students under my wing for a
transformative week of meetings with Auschwitz survivors, hidden children, historians,
visits to Holocaust memorials etc. I remember showering one morning in the hotel, my
hands running over my bloated belly, a telltale sign of ovarian cancer. I've forgiven
myself for letting a serious health issue take the back seat to a once-in-a-lifetime study
tour. But I still carry guilt and trauma with me. Hence, my anxiety.
Many thanks to my friends Nancy, Sandy and John, the most recent contributors to the
""Reunite and Reignite"" initiative to help KEGOS. Please help *if possible;* I realize not
                    
everyone can, nor does everyone want to, for a range of valid reasons. I do not take this
*in any way* personally. But I will continue to be a warrior for women's cancer care.
Given the uncertainty of so much in my life right now, this is one of the ways I feel I can
have real *agency* and empower myself to help other women with 'below the belt'
cancers.
My recent trips to New York and Bedford Springs were memorable for my 'reunions' with
very dear friends from grade/high school, college and grad school. Why were these get
togethers so heart-warming? I'm not entirely sure! Whenever I'm with Eva, Zia, Mitchel,
Bryan, Vinni and Isa (et al - these were the friends I saw on this trip), I'm in a safe space.
The shared history, the road travelled, the coming of age together are all grounding. The
affection. And I rarely *laugh* as hard as I do with the old friends. [I will add that of
course it was wonderful to spend time with my mother -- we made a beeline for the pizza
place as soon as Passover was over -- Arnold, and Ben, with whom I drove to the city
from State College].
In the city I had breakfast w/Bryan, a college friend and NYC kid like myself, at my go-to
coffee shop around the corner from my mother's, Sunburst. We talked about Paris (a city
both of us love, where we've also hung out together), classmates, our aging mothers,
current life/career goals and challenges. A nice morning!
On one occasion, you reach over and casually pick up a chunk of my scone from my
plate. With other dear ones, we laugh hysterically, doubled over, nearly falling off our
seats, our body movements signaling the many other times we've laughed this hard in
the past, all the goofy adventures. Friendship. :)
The ostensible reason for my trip to the city was Ben's participation in the Brooklyn half-
marathon. Unfortunately, I didn't sleep well Saturday night and consequently felt
unsteady Sunday morning -- so I didn't make it. This depressed me, as the pre-cancer
Willa would have had more stamina, poor sleep or not. Fortunately, my brother, with
whom I had planned to meet up at Grand Army Plaza, continued on to Brooklyn and
cheered his nephew on, snapping a pic of him and even getting a low five from Ben as
he ran past. So glad that the valiant Ethan could be there. Ben finished the 13.1 mile
race along with several of his buddies, and their day continued on over beers and cheers
and brunch in Brooklyn.
 
More soon! Greetings from my happy place! :)",3,joy,0.38632223,0.010348523,0.004135946,0.32329008,0.38632223,0.19230959,0.046223454,0.037370145
275,"I don't have Covid, at least not yet. Nor am I symptomatic. I've consistently tested
negative since this past Monday, the day my dear friend and travel companion
extraordinaire, Jill, tested positive for the virus, in Paris. Jill's comment (like me, Jill
usually goes light on the swear words): ""Un-fucking-believable.""
I had finished a loong lunch (the way we like 'em) outdoors at the Terrasse des Archives
Monday, catching up with my wonderful grad school friend Doris and indulging in my
'one per trip' entretcôte frites, when I looked at my phone and saw a message from Jill:
""Can you please call me?"" Uh-oh. We were supposed to meet up later so that I could take
her to dinner at Breizh Café, a well-known, highly recommended crêperie in the Marais.
Before that I was to meet my friend David Drach for drinks at Café La Perle nearby. I sat
on a bench in the ""Place des 260 Enfants"" deported from the Marais, which I've visited
many times with my students, and FaceTimed Jill. I found her propped up on a pillow
against the bright floral wallpaper of her hotel room. ""Willa,"" she moaned, ""I tested
positive."" She was clearly distraught, more concerned about my catching it than having
it herself (she's that caring and mindful a person). Apparently, she had been out
shopping in the morning and had begun to feel ill (with cold symptoms) when she sat
down for lunch. She returned to the hotel, took a Covid home test, and voilà. Un-fucking-
believable. Jill is of course vaccinated and boosted. We had taken pains to be careful in
Paris, masking upon entering stores and in Ubers, in the hotel etc. But undeniably we
had removed our masks to eat breakfast as well as fixings for one dinner bought at the
marché d'Aligre in the room designated for this purpose in the hotel, and in the street. I
                    
was surprised by how few people appeared to mask in Paris, though (and perhaps it's no
better in the States, but my impression is that in New York most people are more
vigilant). When had Jill contracted COVID? From whom? Was I slated to be 'felled' next,
given how much time we had spent together the past several days? Should I prepare for
the Covid-cancer whammy?
Jill suggested I might want to change my flights and leave earlier than planned, an idea I
pretty much dismissed out of hand as I was enjoying my week and somehow feeling
'entitled' to it given the cancer-related challenges I had confronted to get to Paris. Over
the next twelve hours or so, on speaking with a few friends, and thinking through the
situation, I began to change my mind. My contracting COVID on top of cancer and being
stuck in Paris was, in fact, my worst nightmare (and Dr. Beavis' as well). Of course, I felt
terribly for Jill and didn't necessarily want to leave her to fend for herself. On the other
hand, I had confidence in Jill's sensible nature and stability (although she was driven to
tears at least once and if our situations had been reversed I'm convinced I would have
been a blubbering mess at the outset), the support arriving from her husband in Cali, her
three grown daughters, her travel agent who had helped arrange the trip for us. the kind
and helpful staff of our hotel, and, I hope, from me.
In any event, I did continue on to drinks with my friend David Drach (a dear, whose
father's film about the family's fate as French Jews during the Second World War, _Les
Violons du Bal,_ I have shown many times to my students and who has travelled to Penn
State several times to present it) and his newish boyfriend, Patrizio (hope I have that
name right). It was wonderful to see him, but I felt distracted and stressed. Then, since I
was right near Breizh Café, I dined solo there, preoccupied by our Covid worries and
unsure what to do. I walked back to the hotel (despite swollen ankles and feet, a problem
that concerned me all week, although I felt no pain from it, thankfully), stopping en route
at a pharmacy place de la République, which turned out to be open *24 hours/24,* a
relatively rarity in Paris. Outside the pharmacy a Covid testing site was set up. I
explained to the technician, a kind young woman in a hijab, that I had been exposed to
Covid and wanted to be tested (antigen test, pretty much identical to the home test).
She had me fill out a form and then pay a 20 euro fee at the register in the pharmacy.
She then explained to me that the French test involves much more 'force' than the
American one, and that I should prepare myself for that. Indeed, she jabbed the swab
deep into my nasal cavity, leaving me gasping and pained. I was most thankful, though,
for the negative result, which she implied would likely persist (I was not sure I believed
her fully on that, though, as I hadn't explained the entire chronology of the past several
days to her).
Back at the hotel, Jill and I, although in adjacent rooms, FaceTimed each other, as we
would the next day, an absurdity that made us laugh in spite of ourselves.
I slept poorly but my insomnia had the benefit of giving me time to formulate a plan to
                    
return home a day early, *provided* that I receive an official negative Covid test result,
required in order to leave France. As I had an appointment at the Maison Vever at noon, I
had to move quite quickly Tuesday morning. So first I returned to the Covid testing site
for my 'official' test and again, miraculously to me, received a negative result, which I
had actually prayed/wished for. This time I would need to get on the same long line
*twice* to pay. When I told the technician that I really preferred to pay for everything at
once (ie once for the test and then again for the official stamp and form), she was nice
enough to eliminate one of my trips to the cash register. While awaiting my test result,
nervously, I walked to the café next door and ordered a café crème and a croissant,
which I consumed while contemplating the massive statue of the French Republic in the
middle of the square. Armed with my ""get of France free"" (or almost....) card, I then
hurried back to my hotel a few blocks away, called United, and succeeded in booking the
same flight home a day earlier. When I was on hold w/United, I got on the Expedia
website and also changed the Newark>State College leg of my flight to a day earlier
too.  Having taken care of these 'essentials,' I felt much better, as I had found myself
sweating profusely most of the morning, when these arrangements were still in flux.
So...much...uncertainty. I had just enough time to contact my cousin Claudia and let her
know that I might have to cancel our dinner for Wednesday night (damn you, Covid) and
also let Mme Vever know that I might be a bit late for our noon rdv. I then FaceTimed Jill
(in the next room) to see how she was feeling and whether she needed anything.
Jill is still in Paris. She isn't feeling too badly and tells me that her Covid feels more like a
cold, at worst a mild flu. And every day she feels better. She spoke with Randy's doctor,
who looks hot btw (Randy showed me his photo!) and who Jill said was lovely (I had
given her Dr. Mallet's number). The doctor wrote Jill a note in French and English
enabling her to leave France next *Tuesday,* unless she tests negative before that. Jill's
travel agent helped her find a new hotel in the Marais (Jill had to change hotels as ours
was booked), and she's there now; she feels well enough to take short walks and buy
herself food, medicine and other essentials. I feel terribly for her, but she's a trooper
(and a fabulous travel companion, whom I will laud appropriately in another post!).
I am back in State College. Irony #1: the United agent who checked my passport would
not have looked at my Covid status form, which she is supposed to check, if *I had not
reminded her to do so.* In essence, I could have 'gotten through' without it (because of
this particular agent's oversight); presumably, Jill might have as well. Irony #2: after all
the precautions, tests, official forms etc. on my part, a woman sitting in the row behind
me CDG to Newark had a hacking cough and coughed, spit up saliva, and remained
unmasked during most of the seven-hour flight.
We live in strange times.

276,"[I'm back in PA now, but catching up on everything, including rest, after a four back to
back trip tear whose pace some friends have described as 'insane.' No plans to go
anywhere for a while. I started this post a few days ago, in NY.]
Once again I'm writing 'out of order' as I still want to recount my previous trips (NY,
Bedford Springs, Paris). I'll get back to that. But today is a big day, as I'm in the city
(once again) to celebrate Ben's graduation with an M.S. in Data Science from NYU over
lunch for twelve in Chinatown (Ben is opting out of the actual ceremonies, both for the
entire university -- at Yankee Stadium featuring Taylor Swift as speaker -- and for the
Masters' candidates, at the Beacon Theatre uptown). The lunch -- my idea -- will bring
together the Berkman and Silverman clans: Ben's parents (ie me and Michael) and
stepmom (Sue), grandmother (Sharon) and Arnold, Ethan and family (Ronit), Michael's
brother Bruce, and three cousins (two Silverman, one Berkman, Eve, Isaac and Rachel).
Thirty-three years ago we celebrated my own graduation with a Ph.D. from NYU with a
luncheon at a now defunct Italian restaurant on University Place. I remember it as
pleasant. My dad, of blessed memory, wore his own academic regalia as I wore mine that
day; today, though, belongs to Ben, as we celebrate three generations of our affiliation
with NYU. And Michael was with us for lunch on graduation day in 1989 as he was to wish
his son well in 2022. We weren't married yet, but he helped me celebrate my
accomplishment just as I travelled with him out to Bloomington that year to celebrate his
(a loong road trip with an overnight in Columbus, Ohio). We miss Michael's parents too,
and my dad. They would be kvelling.
I am happy to be alive, to toast this happy moment with family and friends. My trip to NY
last month, overnight at the Bedford Springs resort with Vinni and Isa, and recent week
in Paris were all 'shehecheyanu' occasions, colored by my gratitude for simply having
*made it* to the day: ""Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Sovereign of all, who has kept
us alive, sustained us, and brought us to this season."" The four consecutive trips since
late April, taken together, have a somewhat 'breathy' quality to them. I'm tearing
through what my oncologists have described as a 'window of opportunity' before my
upcoming brain scan and pelvic/abdominal/chest CT, possible change in treatment plan,
and lots of new question marks regarding my health and prognosis, all of which are
making me anxious and, at times, depressed. These feelings are perhaps amplified a bit
by Dr. Patel's brusqueness yesterday (in my perception); he intoned somewhat
ominously, re my upcoming scans, ""there will be findings,"" and, re my treatment, ""we'll
run out of options"" (neither of which are news to me, but somehow I expected a lighter
touch from him). I'm in frantic carpe diem mode (""But at my back I always hear/Time's
winged chariot hurrying near.""). I'm certainly feeling 'well enough,' or perhaps I simply
powered my way through on some combination of adrenaline and #willapower. Yet I may
also be sensing in myself some undercurrent of panic, a need to keep moving at all
costs, to invoke a _perpetuum mobile,_ to dance on the edge of a volcano, to make
                    
myself a moving target, to 'run on empty,' to ward off the inevitable (?), despite Dr.
Beavis' observation that I ""sounded good"" in her response the note I sent  her yesterday,
accompanied by a photo of me looking peppy and radiant in Paris. Catch me if you can...
If I keep busy, if I keep surrounding myself with loved ones, I reason, I'm safe. If I stay
still for too long, cancer will find me. Perhaps 'bringing the happy' is actually having a
beneficial effect on my health (or perhaps that's just magical thinking). Who knows? Just
puzzling it all out can be exhausting. In the meantime, though, I plan to get out and
enjoy this gloriously beautiful day in the city, fortified by a yummy cappuccino, nails
manicured with Opi's ""Princesses Rule"" polish and decked out in a new dress from Anne-
Elisabeth (one of last week's purchases in Paris).
""Well, after all is said and done
I did all right, I had my fun
I will walk before they make me
I will walk before they make me run.""
The gathering of the clans:
Our dim sum lunch for twelve in Chinatown, on a glorious spring day under brilliant blue,
cloudless skies,  was great fun. Clattering silver carts bore all manner of dumplings,
sesame balls, rice cakes and cooling coconut and tofu desserts. If I can compliment
myself on two things (and God knows I have much to reproach myself for, too, over the
course of my life), I will note my happiness over 1)my ability to, even talent for,
*federating* disparate friends and family members during uplifting events such as these
(for which I provided the impetus). Nothing makes me happier than to introduce
members of my different friend groups in the hopes that they too might become friends. 
This worked most marvelously in the case of Mitchel, my dear best friend from college,
and Randy, a dear best friend from grad school. Introduced at a party at my mom's
apartment (I think) in the early 1980s, this pair became best friends themselves, thick as
thieves, and the three of us form an unbreakable, 'ride or die' trio. Mitchel befriended a
number of my grad school friends; there are crossovers between Mitchel, Randy and my
high school friends, too. Although I'll be six feet under, literally or symbolically (haven't
decided yet), nothing would please me more (hint, hint) than the image of having all
these folks who are so important to me gathered together, with hope that their own
friendships will form or deepen, in perpetuity; 2)any small role I've played (and I believe
I've worked hard for it, as have Michael and all others involved) in ensuring the success
and continued health of such post-divorce gatherings. It was warming to see how
genuinely happy everyone seemed to be together (in some cases, after many years),
how relaxed everyone appeared, how much affection was visible (at least, that's how it
seemed to me). I personally was delighted to chat with Michael's older brother, Bruce,
who I took to lunch in State College not that long ago, and his older daughter, Rachel
(who was two at our wedding, now a lovely 31-year-old Pilates instructor living in the
                    
city). Of course, Ben's graduation with an M.S. from NYU, his new job (one of five offers)
and two-week trip to Vienna to visit Sammi (he just arrived this morning) all added up to
an eminently ""the kids are alright"" moment, and Ben seemed...well, like Ben (kudos,
Ben, for your history of navigating potentially fraught family situations with ease and
grace, as you are so good at doing; we love you and you can count on your family's
support). One big happy modern family! I rest easier knowing that Ben and Michael are
and have always been extremely close and that Sue is an excellent stepmother. More
than me, Michael was often the one awake at 3 a.m. to change or comfort Ben in the
middle of the night, hanging out with his baby to watch frisbee golf on t.v., the only
reasonable option at 3 a.m. on a weekday.  I know I can count on them to watch over
Ben and also, I hope, to maintain my memory and continue to impart my values and life
lessons.
We lingered outside the restaurant, snapping pictures and chatting. I love days when
time unspools in a most natural way, seemingly untethered to clocks or schedules or
'conventional' time.
Michael, Sue, Bruce, Ben and I then walked to NYU, where a sprawling, crowded street
fair for the graduates filled Washington Square Park and the surrounding streets, awash
in NYU violet splashed on regalia, signs, banners etc. We enjoyed iced coffee outside for
a while at a café on Laguardia Place, at a table dwarfed by NYU's pink-red granite Bobst
Library across the street. Memory dump:
>It is 1974 and I have my first summer job, as a book shelver at Bobst. I am fifteen. To
set it up, my father had spoken with the manager of Bobst, Mr. Flanagan, whom he knew
slightly and whose daughter and her friends had nabbed the same job as me. These kids
were all (Irish) Catholic and had thick Long Island accents; I had never met anyone like
them before. Working with us was a big bunch of 'older' (college age?) folks, so different
from me that I was taken way out of my upper-east-side girls' private school comfort
zone in a good way: a nice couple, Richie and Emily, who took me under their wing, a
good-looking guy named Doug whom I had a crush on (according to my diary from that
summer, Doug was one of several of my coworkers who piqued my attention -- and vice-
versa), a guy named Henry, just back from service in ....'nam (the war was still ongoing,
so long ago...), a beautiful, delicate-looking man from Haiti, Jean, to whom I jabbered in
my best high school French, a guy named Calderon who taught me some Spanish, a guy 
named Sidney who had his own radio show on the NYU station, and others. My family
had been watching the Watergate hearings on t.v. that summer and I remember walking
home from Bobst the day Nixon was expected to resign, extremely worried about what
would happen to the country (it was the first time in my life, but certainly not the last,
that I sensed a threat to our democracy). I remember feeling grown up that summer
sharing dinner, laughs, and perhaps an illegal beer for me with my coworkers at Factoria,
a 'fun' Italian restaurant near the Plaza (58th st.) with unlimited pasta and pitchers of
beer and sangria (a kind of Cheesecake Factory before its time?). The others invited me
                    
to continue our summer night in the city at a club, but in those days my parents still
imposed a curfew...
>It is about 1983 and Mitchel (then an NYU law student), Randy and I are studying at a
long table in a large room at the front of Bobst, overlooking Washington Square Park
(this memory is faint).
>It is summer 1985, and Vinni and I are back from a year in Paris, spending the summer
studying for our Ph.D. comps in October before heading back to Paris for another year.
We grind and cram all day, emerging only at lunchtime, a bit dazed, for a break under
the sweltering July New York sun. We try to find shade on a bench in the park for a while
(I remember buying Sabrett hot dogs for lunch from a cart on the corner), testing each
other on both random facts as well as themes we might need to be conversant with for
our exams (""History of anticlericalism in France; go!""). Then back into the air-conditioned
library for a few more hours.
>2018 (sometime in first half): A seasoned researcher and author by this point, I spend
about a week in Bobst's rare book room, reading the records of Gilded Age New Yorkers
who employed the upscale caterer Louis Sherry for their luncheons and dinners, this for
a project on 19th century Franco-American culinary exchanges. I still head out to the
benches in Washington Square Park at lunchtime and get lost in people watching.
Ben and I peeled away from Bruce, Michael and Sue and checked out the street fair, then
sat on a bench in WSP for a while (it still reeks of pot, much as I remember from my
teenage years). We then continued on to my mother's (all in all, a good 2+ mile walk for
me that day), where we hung out until Ben had to go on to a graduation party in Bklyn.
A good day. Shehecheyanu.

277,"I guess I've sort of bought into the narrative spun by Drs. Beavis and Patel, of a ""window
of opportunity"" dutifully taken advantage of during my four successive trips, a sort of
'victory lap' or 'hail and farewell' before all-important scans and then some sort of
'descent' (Dr. Patel on the upcoming scans: ""There will be findings."" Dr. Beavis: ""I may
want to start you on Avastin after the scans"" -- Avastin, the drug with a 5% risk of bowel
perforation, perhaps a higher risk in my case because of my fistula operation, a bowel
perforation that would mean, per Dr. Beavis, ""game over""). So that's why I lay awake
again last night, consumed by thoughts of my mortality: how do I arrange for a 'green
burial?' Ensure that specific pieces of jewelry are given to certain individuals? Work out
all the financials, beyond the basics of my will? I feel 'well enough,' despite being
                    
increasingly concerned by discomfort and stiffness on the right side of my skull (the
surgery side) that has bothered me for about a month. While Dr. Patel and Dr.
Bettegowda's PA, both of whom I queried about this before leaving for Paris, told me that
they thought the skull stiffness and discomfort was attributable to 'post-op changes'
(even up to four months after the fact?...) rather than cancer (I have none of the
recognizable brain cancer symptoms: headaches, double vision, balance problems), Dr.
Patel (who even briefly examined my skull before I left for Paris) now wants me to have a
brain/head MRI asap. Consequently, I've moved my MRI up to this Friday from June 13, at
the ungodly hour of 5:30...a.m.! Driving to the hospital at that hour should
be...interesting (I'll need to keep my eyes sharply focused on any deer that may cross
my path), although the sun will be out by the time I'm done, just in time for me to head
to...chemo. Oy. I don't know what's up with my head/brain/skull but I hope it doesn't get
worse (I may try to move my MRI up to even sooner). I also hope I haven't waited too
long to act, but was relying, perhaps erroneously, on what my doctors had told me
(including Dr. Patel the younger's statement that there was only a 15% of my brain
cancer recurring). I'm fairly consumed by anxiety about this, as you can likely tell.
As I shared with my friend Jackie, who picked me up from chemo on Friday (we always
get right to some quality conversation in the car), I was unhappy with Dr. Patel's
brusqueness the previous day. This is a trait I detected in him from the outset, but it
seemed to have mellowed the more I got to know him. When I asked him to what he
might attribute the stiffness in my skull, he barked ""I need a test!"" He sees so many
patients that he seemed to have forgotten basics about my treatment, including which
drug I'm currently receiving! And perhaps he was simply having a bad day; he expressed
frustration to me about another ovarian cancer patient he's seeing, who is refusing
treatments that would benefit her and whose husband seems completely clueless about
his wife's condition. ""It's very challenging,"" said Dr. Patel. I can only imagine (but please
don't take your frustration out on me!). Meanwhile, Dr. Beavis is in Spain on a well-
deserved bike trip and won't be back for a while. Dr. Stephanie Wethington, who I know
a bit from Hopkins, is in charge of Dr. Beavis' patients while she's away, and my
impression is that, like the entire KEGOS team, she's extremely competent, kind and
responsive. If there's a problem, I will contact her.
Despite my fatigue, I managed to do some work today then, as I like to do, took a long,
relaxing drive in the country in search of fresh produce. This led me down the bumpy
driveways of Amish farms every time I saw a sign for ""Asparagus,"" now abundant, as is
rhubarb (I'm thinking chilled asparagus soup tomorrow, and an omelet w/asparagus and
cheese tonight). I'm the rhubarb 'queen' so can always find a use for the fresh pink fruit.
Also bought some fresh eggs. I love these little roadside farm stands that operate on the
honor system. Take what you need and leave the $ in a cash box; the family's likely
planting or plowing the field (with teams of horses!).
Writing about my recent trips also boosts my morale, so please indulge me (or skip this
                    
section if you prefer). It's all about keeping the 'good' and 'bad' in balance. The bleak
moments make the fabulous ones even sweeter; the fabulous ones make the bleak time
easier to handle, as there's such an accumulation of stuff to be grateful for. See series of
pictures above: 1-3. Wonderful reunion lunch in the city with my high school pals Eva
and Zia. While I've seen Eva (blonde) and Zia (dark hair) separately not too long ago --
Eva in East Hampton this summer as she lives year-round in Sag Harbor, Zia via Zoom
on several occasions during the pandemic -- the three of us hadn't been together in
years. We had so much fun reminiscing and catching up over tapas at Boqueria in the
Flatiron district. Both Eva and Zia entered Nightingale in about eighth grade; perhaps I
felt some kinship with them because our families engaged in artistic/intellectual
professions unlike the Mad Men professions many of our classmates' fathers seemed to
exemplify -- the well-known art movie house, Angelika, was named after Eva's mother,
Angelika Saleh, and her father was a film producer; Zia's mother is the Indian cooking
'guru,' Madhur Jaffrey while her father (stepfather), Sanford Allen, was the first Black
violinist in the NY Philharmonic, and a prominent, highly talented one at that. Zia and I
both lived way downtown, far from the pristine Upper East Side where many of our
classmates lived; Eva and I were both Jewish. I'm sure  our classmates' reality was much
different than the way I perceived it at the time, but nevertheless I often felt marginal vis
à vis the dominant NBS culture. Eva and Zia were partners in crime, engaging with me in
all sorts of kooky mischief (much of which cannot be divulged here!); confidants (all
those sleepovers! all that laughter!); and later, cherished, trusted friends. Zia and I have
always bonded over writing, including a few tentative joint writing efforts; she's a
talented published author, and a writing teacher at the New School. I hope the pictures
convey how happy we were to spend time with one another. As Zia and I were seated
too far away from each other across the table to give one another a hug during the
photo, we held hands and lifted them in a kind of triumphant 'salute,' and then giggled
about it.
Pictures 4-5. As soon as my mother opened the door to her apartment to welcome
Mitchel, I knew I'd hear his warm, energetic, enthusiastic voice: ""It's so good to see
you!!"" Then I knew I'd get the biggest, tightest hug ever. My first real friend in college,
Mitchel and a female pal of his befriended me my freshman year (they were
sophomores) in a class we were taking on Proust. I was the only freshman in the class,
really way out of my league. I barely opened my mouth the entire semester. Mitchel and
his friend took me under their wing, inviting me to parties and showing me much
friendliness. When I was twenty, Mitchel and I travelled Italy north to south, a memorable
trip. We overlapped for several years at NYU, and have always visited with one another
either in NY, Paris (often with our friend Randy), or Nice (where Mitchel now lives with his
partner, Fabien). Mitchel has a gift for friendship and laughter; here we are sitting on a
bench in St. Mark's Place in the Village (we had had a lovely lunch near my mom's
apartment, and had then walked over to Veselka, where I bought a quart of their
delicious mushroom barley soup). We had just taken this selfie and were accusing one
another of looking 'feeble,' heads cocked awkwardly, odd smiles, and eyes looking
                    
askance. For some reason, we both found this vision of us as feeble hysterical and were
literally nearly falling off the bench, doubled over in laughter. The second picture of us,
on the couch in my mother's living room, contains all the love, connection, silliness, and
memories of a beautiful friendship. :)

278,"Am still catching up, and for the moment seem to be veering into diary writing as a
""preserving memories"" exercise rather than a means for providing health
updates, pace Caring Bridge. But the two are in fact related, as mentioned in my last
entry. I'm in a bit of a funk, concerned about the stiffness in my skull as I await my MRI
on Friday (no earlier appointments available this week as of this morning), have written
to all my doctors (depressed that Dr. Patel the younger never responded to a message I
wrote him on *May 2* to discuss the concern about my skull), have considered then
rejected the possibility of going to the ER here (truly a place of last resort for me, unless
the situation becomes intolerable). A bunch of my friends are away for the summer or a
good part of it (while others, thankfully, are here) and I feel isolated in my worry, vox
clamantis in deserto. Nevertheless, I managed to do some work this morning, my brain
appears to be functioning in terms of cognition and memory, and I feel nowhere near as
ill as I did when my friend Martina kindly drove me to Lewistown hospital for an MRI in
January, and from there I was life-flighted to Hopkins....
It's summer, and I'd love to be travelling or out in nature, in abundant good health. Oh
well. Must hold on to the good memories from the past few weeks.
I wonder if I'm writing in my journal too much. Today, it's diverting me, calming me,
providing me with an interlocutor, lifting my mood a bit. But I don't want to bring anyone
down with this.
*Update just now: Dr. Patel the younger's office just messaged me and asked me to
come in for an appointment tomorrow at 2 p.m. in case I need a prescription from him as
a radiation oncologist. I will do this! The fact that they are not telling me to go to the ER
immediately makes me feel somewhat relieved.
I knew that among the friends or groups I wanted to spend time with these days my grad
school friends would have pride of place. There's something about the intensity of the
range of  experiences we shared from approx 1982 to 1988, in addition to all the dinner
parties, outings, travel (two years in Paris for me and Vinni, plus London, Madrid...),
laughter, adventures, life milestones, illnesses, new jobs, children (many sons!) etc.
we've experienced together, that has created an unshakeable bond among us as friends,
women, colleagues. Further, this group of (mainly) women friends has been
extraordinarily caring to me throughout my illness. I am so very grateful.
I concocted a plan to treat my 'filles' to a weekend in the country (chez moi), including
an overnight at Omni Bedford Springs Resort and Spa, a pretty ritzy resort about 1.5
hours from here, which in the late 19th c. was the site of a 'wellness retreat' for well-
heeled patrons, due to the many mineral springs in the area. I had stayed at the hotel
once, which is chock full of memorabilia and photos recalling the resort's past as a place
for 'taking the waters.' As many of my grad school friends are devotees of the c. 1900
era, I thought this would be a great choice for us, and we've always been in favor of all
                    
sorts of indulgences over the years (most recently, purchasing, when we have the
means, specific porcelain patterns, original posters from the c. 1900 era etc.). So a 'girls
spa day' seemed like an appropriate treat.
Two friends, Harriet and Shanny, were unfortunately unable to make the trip. Shanny
surely would have brought her crystal pendulum for us to interrogate, her intention-
setting cards, and her irreverent humor (she's the one who instructs us -- all of us
lifelong scholars of France, one of us French -- to yell ""Fuck France"" instead of ""Cheese""
or even ""Fromage"" when our picture is taken). But Vinni, Isa and I had plenty of laughs;
in fact, we've been laughing, crying, and everything in between together for forty years.
Our invented franglais lexicon includes the terms ""frapper la route"" (""hit the road""), ""sac
de louches"" (""scumbag"") and, as of our most recent visit, ""sans clou"" (""clueless""). For
anyone in the know, these are literal translations of French phrases and are completely
meaningless and inane, nevertheless sending us into gales of side-splitting laughter, as
do all our numerous 'in jokes.' Maybe you just had to be there...
Vinni and Isa drove to my place from Isa's in Montclair, NJ (Vinni lives near Boston and
had flown to Newark, then met up with Isa for the drive), and we spent the evening
chatting over apéro and dinner before it was time for bed. One or the other of us kept
'losing' her cell phone in my house; highly competent women, we can all nevertheless be
a bit ditzy when we're together... The next morning we breakfasted then fortified
ourselves with coffee from Café Lemont (to which these ladies had kindly offered me a
gift certificate, knowing I love this café's cappuccino, made with milk from a local dairy).
We sat outside in the sun at the café for a bit, before we decided to ""frapper la route.""
We enjoyed a wonderful day at Bedford Springs: lunched outdoors (weather was lovely)
and later enjoyed Prosecco on the same outdoor patio; hiked one of the many trails to
the 'limestone spring;' dined at a good Italian restaurant in the cute town of Bedford;
checked out some of the c. 1900 artefacts from the resort; toasted marshmallows and
made 'smores at the fire pit; drank champagne and were silly (think feather boas!) in our
hotel rooms.
The spa was very 'ooh la la' and smelled divine. We were given a tour of the different
baths and related relaxation spaces and then had time to enjoy them: first, an energizing
shower called ""Le Déluge"" (après moi le déluge?) stocked with the heavenly-smelling
(and pricey) products sold in the spa shop; then, the steam room; next, a hot whirlpool
bath; and finally, a cold bath (I was too wimpy to try that). We cycled through the series
of pools and saunas a few times; the decor, fittingly, was again 'Gilded Age' with all
manner of refreshing flavored waters and fresh fruit available throughout the spa. Before
my pedicure, I relaxed in the lounge, a large space outfitted with chaise lounges, potted
palms, small treats to eat and drink, fluffy white robes to wear. Ahh... No massage or
facial for me (unlike for Vinni and Isa) as any manipulation of my lymph nodes is not
advisable for me. But my shiny purple toes are a great look for summer!
                    
After our spa morning, we had lunch at the hotel restaurant before Vinni and Isa took off
for Newark airport and I drove home (in pouring rain).
Two years ago we had a lovely time at Kripalu Yoga Retreat in the Berkshires, this year
we blissed out at Bedford Springs. Where to next time, beautiful and brilliant ladies? It's
guaranteed to be a blast. And in the meanwhile, if any State College (or other) friends
would like to join me for a trip to Bedford Springs (en route to D.C.; easily accessible
from Baltimore and Pittsburgh), please lmk!

280,"When evil manifests itself so blatantly, I sometimes (fleetingly) think that death will be a
relief from such a cascade of atrocious news. I remember feeling this way in regard to
certain friends or relatives who have died (eg ""I'm so glad X didn't live to experience
September 11th;"" I'm so glad my father didn't know most of the horrors of the Trump
presidency"" « Or Covid. »). I woke up crying today thinking about the massacre of
children and teachers in Texas. The last time I remember literally waking up crying was
when Trump won the presidency in 2016. And yet, of course, we must go on, and must
do what we can to protest this inhuman, evil, obscene aspect of our culture (if my health
holds, I'll definitely put my time behind our critical PA elections in Nov.). And yet, love
abounds as well, as I can attest. Choose the blessing over the curse... (Deuteronomy
30:19).
Somewhat perversely, today I snapped pics of some of our many local gun shops, on the
same road about ten miles out of this progressive university town. Outside one of them,
a sign is proudly, almost brazenly unfurled: ""God, Guns, Trump."" That pretty much says it
all, doesn't it? Don't tell me gun control is not a political issue. Then needed to drive way
out into the country, amidst the rolling hills and farm stands (fifteen stalks of freshly cut
                    
rhubarb for $2, anyone?), to begin to clear my mind, haunted by the niggling feeling that
in these parts 'quaint' and 'picturesque' often (but not always) translate to conservative,
right-wing (if the road signs are any indication).
Health update: I was able to get an appointment yesterday with my neuro-oncologist's
PA to address the continuing stiffness in my skull and upper neck. I was relieved that her
diagnosis pointed to inflammation rather than the ""C word;"" she told me that
inflammation can often occur in the skull/brain/head at any point after brain surgery and
radiation, even this far out. She prescribed steroids for me and perhaps just the relief of
having some understanding of what may be going on helped me sleep last night. I don't
feel, at this point for example, that I need to rush to the ER. Of course, more will be
determined from my MRI, scheduled for this Friday. I will then have a neck CT Friday,
June 3 (I actually requested this to address 'puffiness' in my neck, perhaps also caused
by inflammation per the PA) and an abdominal/pelvic/chest CT in mid-June. After these
important scans, a determination will be made about my treatment, eg continue with
weekly Taxol alone or add Avastin; some other option that I may not be aware of.
Knowing that I'm running out of viable treatment options, I will also do a bit more of my
own research on available clinical trials, but those options may be limited for me. In my
fantasy, the situation will be as it has been with my gums: I've been at risk for gum
surgery for years, but somehow have 'held on,' with my gum recession unchanged, for
many years, just on the precipice in relation to the maximum erosion tolerable before a
painful gum graft is prescribed.  My dentist and I have gotten a laugh out of my 'hanging
on by a thread' for years; it's quite remarkable. Wouldn't it be nice if my cancer could
'hold steady' as well? Perhaps I am an outlier. Who knows? We'll find out more soon. Dr.
Beavis has checked in with me from Spain and is definitely on top of the latest
developments, as is Dr. Patel.
I'm concerned for Brenda R., my college classmate who is surviving Stage 4 ovarian
cancer. As I've mentioned, I did not know Brenda in college (unfortunately) but was
introduced to her fairly recently by another Brenda (P.). Brenda R. and I have zoomed
and check in with one another periodically. Brenda reported a few days ago that she's
been in the hospital every month since November, sleeps a lot, and is closely watched by
her two sisters, both staying with her. Her doctors say they've never seen anyone at her
advanced stage survive so long. ""Not that I'm going for any records!"" Brenda quipped to
me, her text accompanied by several 'laugh' emojis. Yeah, sometimes all we can do is
laugh! You go, Brenda, warrior sister. You are in my thoughts. 
Despite yesterday's tragedy, I am grateful for this pretty day (although actually a bit
cloudy in the end), for being in touch with a number of friends, and for a pretty drive in
the country. Nice memories -- ""no, no, they can't take that away from me.""
I am working through emails and texts that accrued during my trips, and writing
everyone back in order, more or less. My apologies for the delays. I hope you will hear
                    
from me soon!
This was going to be a post about my Paris trip, but I'm still too overwhelmed by the
thought of children being murdered. But I do want to write about Paris too. A good
project for the holiday weekend.

281,"Yesterday was grueling. Despite my best efforts to package an alarm set for 3:50 a.m. to
begin my day as an 'adventure,' it wasn't fun. I was up by 4:00 a.m. after about two
hours of sleep, ate a bowl of yogurt topped with homemade strawberry rhubarb sauce
and turned my attention to the NYTimes Spelling Bee (miraculously I attained ""Genius""
level at that hour; I'm a faithful Bee girl, sorry all you Wordle fans). Blessings on Ben,
who texted me around 4:30 to wish me well. Although six hours *ahead* of me with
Sammi in Budapest, he had not yet eaten breakfast, but then sent me a photo of the
yummy looking *Israeli* breakfast they were sharing near their Airbnb in the Jewish
quarter of Budapest. Go figure. Many thanks to those who sent very early morning (or
even day before) texts or emails conveying well wishes. You know who you are. I greatly
appreciated them as 4:30 a.m. is an isolating time, at least for me.
I drove to the hospital in a dark rain; as I approached, a few more cars appeared on the
road. A brain MRI is not fun; fortunately, I'm not highly claustrophobic, but the hour's
worth of jackhammering and blaring sounds swirling around my head as the images
were being captured is jarring. Luckily, I was still pretty much half asleep, yet also
fixated (once again) on my process for picking out certain of my jewelry pieces to give to
specific people. I had a few copies of the images made on discs to send to Drs. Beavis,
Patel and Bettegowda. It still astounds me that it seems so complicated for the hospital
here in State College to push the images forward to Dr. Patel the elder, also in State
College yet working for a different medical system, Geisinger Health.
I might mention that my brain MRI was scheduled for a few weeks from now at a more
reasonable hour, but I decided to move it up once what is increasingly seeming like
inflammation, manifesting itself as a 'stiffness' in my skull, began to bother me. A steroid
I'm taking for that problem appears to be helping a lot, thankfully! I'm feeling much less
tenderness on the right side of my head, and can sleep on my right side now too.
I emerged from the hospital as the sun was rising and drove home, then crashed on my
bed for about two hours, before I had to wake up again to go to chemo. My stalwart
neighbor, Janis, drove me, while my equally kind friend Jackie drove me home. By then it
was about 3 p.m.; all the cafés with decent coffee were closed, so I opted for a swing
past Meyer's dairy and a small sundae with mint chip ice cream. My eating yesterday
was as odd and untimely as my sleeping, but I just allowed myself to indulge in
whatever, whenever. Chemo and a magnesium drip proceeded smoothly; my neuropathy
was bothering me so I found I couldn't get into a comfortable position for sleeping, but
must have dozed for a bit as on awakening I felt disoriented about my whereabouts.
At some point a chemo nurse came over to my bay and let me know that the hospitals'
radiologists had read the report on my MRI and, thank goodness, everything appears to
be clear. No clear signs of new cancer nor any other significant finds. This is certainly
                    
good news, but I haven't worked up the courage to read the report myself yet and Dr.
Patel was out yesterday. I may read it this weekend or may wait to 'bundle' the scan
reports for a more 'holistic' explanation from my medical team (next scan, on my neck at
my request to check out the puffiness there, will take place next Friday; the third, on my
abdomen/pelvis/chest, to be done on June 13th). For the moment, though, it *appears*
as if I won't have to deal with a brain/ovarian cancer whammy, which doesn't mean my
cancer won't recur in my brain at some point, and which also doesn't mean that I won't
have to contend with other metastases (as I am already with regard to several lymph
nodes, colon etc.). We move forward, in the meanwhile, and enjoy these short reprieves
right now as much as possible.
After Jackie brought me home, I once again crashed on my couch, this time waking up
around 9 p.m.! I turned on the Celtics-Heat game and ordered some Indian food off Grub
Hub (my stomach feels a bit yucky today). Exciting game, unlike some of the lackluster
play I've seen in this series. I miss the days of Jordan and Magic - who wouldn't miss that
thrilling level of play? -- and of course the beloved Knicks teams of my 20s and 30s
(Ewing, Mase, Oakley etc.), but I do enjoy watching Steph Curry (who'll be waiting for the
winner of the Celtics-Heat Game 7 on Sunday) and Jayson Tatum play.
I was in bed by midnight and slept well and soundly, waking up once around 4 a.m. After
a day spent totally out of whack, my Circadian rhythms seem to be back to normal.
Stayed in bed until 10 a.m., then went to Café Lemont for an iced cappuccino, gassed up
my car, and headed out on what proved much easier to present to myself as an
adventure: a long drive to Milroy, Reedsville and Belleville in search of fresh produce.
This long drive (75 miles for the day?) involved many treks down gravel roads to tucked
away farms; slowing down for all manner of Amish carts and buggies; stopping at
numerous roadside stands; conversations with the Amish farmers (invariably surrounded
by a gaggle of sweet-faced, curious children); working out rough calculations of prices for
the foodstuffs, often picked right out of the garden (strawberries!). I bought some
delicious looking asparagus, more rhubarb, a hothouse tomato, and a big jar of
unpasteurized cream (hopefully devoid of bacteria that might harm my fragile
stomach?). I love going to farmers markets, but also very much enjoy dealing directly
with the farmers on their farms and their ethic of sustainability. No chemicals, all natural,
plots tilled by hand or larger ones by horses etc. We'll see what tastiness I'll hopefully
concoct from these products. In my heart, I'm a city girl for sure, but the mellow
countryside, network of gurgling streams, acres of green fields, silos, old barns and quiet
balance me.
Having brunch with a friend tomorrow, outdoors, then maybe some cooking and
planting. Two defenses coming up in next two weeks, so currently reading two
dissertations awaits. Onwards.

282,"As my week in Paris was a designated part of my 'wellness therapy' consisting of a return
to my 'happy place' after three years away, I do want to leave a trace of it here. Despite
my coming very near to not making the trip for fear of contracting COVID or having my
cancer worsen there, I am of course overjoyed to have taken advantage of this 'window
of opportunity,"" so designated by my medical team. Mann Tracht, Un Gott Lacht: Man
Plans, God Laughs. Despite myriad precautions (near constant masking, bags of
medications crammed into my suitcase, lists of Parisian doctors' names and numbers in
                    
my purse etc.), Jill came down with COVID on our fifth day in Paris, leaving me to depart
a day early while she was required to remain in Paris an extra week until she tested
negative (in fact, I believe she received a written note from my friend Randy's physician -
whom he dubs ""Dr. Love"" [don't ask] - stating that she'd be asymptomatic after a week:
another 'get out of France' card). After Monday I never saw the poor woman again, but
had to resort to FaceTiming her in the room next to mine! Through it all -- sitting across
from Jill in enclosed indoor restaurants and breakfast rooms, sharing a dinner with her
shopped for at a local market -- I never tested positive for COVID. Go figure. Maybe in
this sense things did 'work out' as my contracting Covid as a cancer patient in Paris
could have yielded catastrophic results for me, but of course I felt terribly for Jill, and was
loath to leave her alone. She's all better now, back in Cali with her husband and with her
three adult daughters checking in regularly, and we've had a good laugh about our
(mis)adventure. I'm sure it brought us closer in some way. Mann Tract, un Gott Lacht: at
the airport flying home, I had to *remind* the attendant to check the results of my Covid
screening for my negative result. I'm quite sure I could have sailed through precheck
without this apparently vital control.
Speaking of Jill, she was a wonderful travel companion. And friend.  We had never
travelled together, but she had kindly visited me in PA during an earlier stage of my
cancer journey to help me out, driving here from her daughter's home in Princeton, NJ.
We've seen each other here and there over the past few years, over drinks in the city
(where she has an apartment), at the memorial service for another classmate, and have
kept in touch, but were likely not one another's very closest friend (ie we had drifted out
of one another's lives a bit). Not only is Jill a seasoned traveler, completely on top of our
logistics, helpful to me when I flagged physically during our long wait at CDG passport
control, security etc., not only was she laid back and agreeable (while always looking
ultra-stylish), happy to accompany me to favorite spots, neighborhoods, museum etc.
while also striking out on her own with complete confidence at other times (her French,
remembered from her studies at the Lycée français in NY, was completely sturdy). She is
also a wonderful and interesting and and kind and smart and fun friend (a UCLA MBA and
former Tufts undergrad, she runs her husband's law office in Calabasas). Every time we'd
sit down to dinner or at a café, I knew there'd be no lack of things to discuss, not just
about our trip but also about our families of origin (whom we both knew versions of from
our high school days) and families we've created, lives, careers, Jewish identities, travels
etc. What a blessing to reconnect with my girlhood friend in these circumstances. Jill,
thank you for offering to be my travel buddy. You deserve every iota of the lovely life
you and Fred have created for yourselves and your family. I would travel anywhere with
you!
A highlight for us may have been dinner with *another* of our high school classmates
(remember, there were only 23 of us so it's really a sisterhood), Christina, and her
                    
charming French husband, Vincent. While I've met up with Christina, who excels at
teaching and touring Paris with American students on study abroad programs, each time
I'm in Paris, Jill had not seen her in many years. We laughed when we realized we were
sitting outside at a café/bistro underneath a sign marked ""Produits frais"" (""Fresh
Products"") and Vincent took a few whimsical pictures of me with a giant teddy bear at
the café, one of the omnipresent ""Ours des Gobelins"" (kind of therapy bears to help
Parisians through the pandemic), a lovely touch in often whimsical Paris (https://www.sor
tiraparis.com/news/in-paris/articles/180876-the-phenomenon-of-the-giant-teddy-bears-at-
les-gobelins-neighborhood-in-paris/lang/en).
What I loved best was a week spent appropriating the Parisian space, cutting a swath
through 'my' Paris, the one I've come to love particularly over the years, revisiting
places, tastes, smells, sensations - and people - that make me happy. The weather was
magnificent. I loved sitting in the mellow sunshine under that ""certain slant of light"" at
about 6 p.m., either in the beautiful courtyard of the MAHJ (Jewish Museum) or relaxing
over a drink (I couldn't overdo it, but did allow myself some wine and a Campari spritz --
along with lots of Perrier menthe, my refreshing go-to drink on hot days in Paris). I loved
sitting with Doris in small gardens tucked off to the side of the Archives nationales, which
I discovered a few years ago. I absolutely loved renewing my habit of spending Sunday
morning at the marché d'Aligre, tasting samples of fresh fruits, buying favorite foods,
visiting the covered marché Beauveau, the large outdoor market, and the flea market
(my 'scarf lady,' Martine, remembered me!), ducking into wonderful fromageries along
the rue d'Aligre, stopping for a coffee and people watching, buying a sweet pain brioché
in an excellent bakery, enjoying life.
Friends: I prioritized, in part, seeing friends as I knew that would make me happy and
wanted to catch up with and check in with my oldest pals - a high school friend, college
and grad school friends, French colleagues who have become friends. I certainly would
have liked to have seen others but was careful not to run myself ragged - and I did as
much as I thought I was able to in six days, without tiring myself too much. Aside from
dinner with Jill, Vincent and Christina, I had a lovely lunch with my dear friend Doris (one
of our group of 'filles' from grad school at NYU) at the Café des Archives in the Marais;
had a drink with my filmmaker/actor friend David Drach, with whom I've nourished a
translatlantic friendship for a good ten years, also in the Marais (and met his new
boyfriend); unfortunately, I had just learned of Jill's Covid diagnosis so was feeling upset
and distracted...; enjoyed dinner at a lovely boutique bistro, La Pharmacie (in a
renovated 19th c. pharmacy), with my colleague and friend Vincent Duclert (whom I first
met in about 1995 (?) when I showed up in a rainstorm at the Archives nationales where
he was then working, my socks drenched; Vincent procured dry socks for me somehow. I
also credit Vincent for introducing me to the chocolate shop Jadis et Gourmand in the rue
des Archives, from which he had been gifted that day a giant 'message board' composed
of tablets of milk and dark chocolate, which he shared with me, spelling out something
like ""Félicitations!"" -- there have been many causes for congratulations over the years in
                    
Vincent's eminent career as an historian, but in those days we were both still starting
out). Now my friendship with Vincent includes his delightful and kind American wife,
Diana, who unfortunately could not join us for dinner that evening); and spent a number
of hours over drinks and dinner at Mensae in Belleville with my 'ride or die' partners in
crime, Mitchel and Randy (my friends from college and grad school). Our 'Three
Mousquetaires' reunions since the early 1980s (and of course Mitchel and I go back
further), taking us through the Village, Paris, Nice and elsewhere, don't come about as
often as I'd like, but when they do I know we'll be in great spirits, and laughter and love
will abound. I was sorry not to have been able to meet my cousin Claudia, currently on a
prestigious assignment as an international arbitration judge in Paris, for dinner the last
night, along with Jill, but she understood that our plans had been completely upended by
Covid. I hope to see her before long, on one side or another of the Atlantic!
Things I ate: I insisted of having a few of my favorites: salmon tartare w/crispy frites; a
rare entrecôte w/more frites; a yummy croque monsieur; a delicious éclair from Stohrer
in the rue Montorgeuil made with exceptional chocolate; a sole chocolate from
chocolatier Jacques Génin; the chocolate mousse at Mensae (a study in contrasts: warm
chocolate v. a hidden scoop of vanilla cream, smooth texture v. crunchy bits, black v.
white etc.); a quartet of Eastern European lunch treats en plein air at chez Marianne, rue
des Rosiers (falafel balls, humus, baba ganoush, herring in mustard sauce); a perfectly
ripe crottin, delicious; delectably ripe, sweet strawberries; rosette de Lyon, tapenade
with figs, goose liver pâté, a mi-cuit (molten chocolate cake); an excellent crêpe
w/rhubarb at Breizh Café in the Marais. I missed out on a few faves: have to say I did not
taste an exceptional croissant (the ones in the hotel were frozen...), nor a superior
baguette sandwich, nor did I get to have my favorite pastry (tarte au citron), nor a
macaron (coffee or chocolate), did not register any truly exceptional wine and did not
have a truly 'aah' inspiring café crème doused in warm, creamy foam. But hey. I was still
in foodie heaven.
Hotel: Very nice, in the 11e (my favorite arrondissement), small boutique hotel, Hôtel Le
Mareuil. On a quiet street (rue de Malte). Closer to 'hipster' 11e (rue JP Timbaud) than to
my preferred 'bobo' 11e (rue Paul Bert, marché d'Aligre). Well-situated, a close walk to
the upper Marais (rue de Turenne, rue de Bretagne, République). Very helpful, bilingual
staff (although I was happy as a ....croissant to be jabbering away in French and
delighted to tap into that part of my cultural/linguistic identity); clean, Covid-safe (or so
we hoped?). I had a 'deluxe' room on the top floor, which of course, being Paris, was
quite small but clean and comfortable, with a view over Parisian rooftops. Breakfast was
adequate. Apparently there were some American style amenities like a gym, which I
didn't have time to check out. I do recommend.
What I bought: My shopping appetite was whet, as was Jill's, and we enjoyed introducing
one another to some of our favorite shops. Practically on arrival, I headed straight to my
favorite jewelry store, La Tonkinoise in the rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, where Chantal
                    
Manoukian, the most creative jeweler who upcycles vintage pieces found in flea markets
into all sorts of striking bracelets, earrings, barrettes etc., remembered me very well (I
follow her on Instagram and she knows I'm always in the market for dragonfly-themed
pieces). I bought a pretty bracelet featuring a kind of Art nouveau/Deco piece in silver. I
also took Jill along to my favorite clothing store, Anne-Elisabeth. Fairly slim pickings in
the sale basement, but I did buy a nice summer dress and two shirts. Also selected a
nice smelling body lotion at Artisan Parfumeur in the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, where
the saleswoman was unnecessarily snooty, and was tempted by unique skirts in a pop-up
store in the same street. No time to go book shopping, unfortunately (although Vincent
kindly gifted me three of his recent publications), and the rest of the items I bought were
either food-related or gifts.
Other visits: Beyond visiting with friends, walking (perhaps around 3-4 miles/day for me,
not bad considering my stamina is subject to off-kilter blood counts, effects of
medication etc.), café sitting, sensual imbibing etc., I did make it, as planned, to La
Samaritaine, an iconic 1869 Parisian department store located near the Pont-Neuf (1er),
recently subject to a vast, meticulous renovation to its former glory. The multitude of
pricey sales points in the store held no interest for me, but the architectural restoration
was fascinating -- a torrent of arabesques, peacock motifs, pastel yellows and blues,
steel and glass forming an ornate pre-Art nouveau shell. Delightful. Also had time for one
exhibit, on Proust's Jewishness, at the MAHJ (quite interesting, yet I took issue
w/comparisons of his editorial annotations on his manuscripts to midrash). Would have
loved to have seen the Boldini exhibit at the Petit Palais. Might I be cautiously optimistic
about a 'next time?'
A memorable morning at the Maison Vever: One of my week's highlights was visiting the
showroom of the recently relaunched Maison Vever, the fabled jewelry house to which
I've devoted much of my research over the last fifteen years or so, founded by Henri and
Paul Vever's grandfather in Metz in 1821. Camille and Damien Vever, the adult children
of Dorothée and Bruno Vever (Bruno being Paul's descendant, as Henri, the subject of
my research, left no direct descendants), are the brainchildren behind the relaunch, and
the showroom sits high above the rue de la Paix leading to the Opéra and in view of the
Place Vendôme, a stone's throw from the original Maison Vever. The showroom is
sublime (and subject to heavy security), the first jewelry lines, featuring gold, plique-à-
jour enamel, and lab grown diamonds both hearkening back to earlier pieces like Vever's
_Sylvia_ pendant but with a modern sensibility, are gorgeous (gingkos!), and also on
display in the new Vever boutique at Le Printemps. I was delighted of course to see my
book, an edition of Vever's diary from 1898, on display, while the family was also kind
enough to show me some original Vever pieces (including charming earrings Lalique
crafted for Henri Vever's daughter, Marguerite) in its possession. We casually discussed
possible directions for future collaboration around art, commerce and research, as the
Vevers wish to penetrate the American market, and plan to visit New York before long to
this end.  After joining for group photos on the showroom's 7th floor terrace, I enjoyed a
                    
convivial lunch with Bruno and Dorothée Vever (who has been exceptionally kind and
well-disposed and supportive towards me over the past several years and whom I like a
lot), our conversation ranging over French history (Louis XIV's policies!), Vever of course,
my treatment (briefly) and much else. After lunch, Bruno and Dorothée desposited me at
Foucher, another illustrious _chocolatier_ founded in 1819 in the avenue de l'Opéra,
when this area was the epicenter of Parisian luxury commerce and aristocratic tourism.
Dorothée had first taken me to Foucher a few years ago, and I bought some gifts for
friends.
It goes without saying that my relationship to Paris, and France in general, is like any
major relationship that defines one's life, lest you think for a second that I'm simply a
cliché-spouting Pollyannaish, garden-variety Francophile.  It's full of ups and downs, rifts
and reunions, disappointments and pleasures, love and distaste. Anti-Semitism is
abhorrent to me (as is all prejudice, of course), and I revile that part of France's history,
having not only devoted much of my research to these questions but also having been
privy to banal, run of the mill (yet no less revelatory) anti-Jewish 'humor' (and worse) in
certain social situations in France. Bureaucratic inertia makes my skin crawl. But I
daresay this 'fraughtness' is just part of what has 'complexified' infinitely my relationship
to France. The relationship is also a scrapbook of my life over the last (nearly) half-
century. So many 'Willas' have sojourned there.  But what I've tried to capture here, in
this post and during this trip, is a more like a sensibility, a sense of well-being, at a
particular moment in time. Un 'feeling.'
Was my rambling, cosmic, ruminative revisiting of my time(s) in France since 1975 worth
a night of insomnia last night? I have to believe it was. I caught a glimpse of my sixteen-
year-old self drinking cheap wine and flirting, with the rest of the summer study group in
which I participated under the auspices of the Northfield Mount Herman School, at a little
restaurant in the Latin Quarter, called ""Le Bateau Ivre"" (_pace_ Rimbaud), then getting
lost in the warren of streets around St. Michel with an American friend made on the trip,
Margot, before somehow hopping onto a _bateau mouche_ at the last minute for an
evening cruise around Paris with the rest of the group, which left me 'éblouie' (I have a
journal or a letter to my parents that recounts this evening but I can't find it right now).
More pictures to follow.
Health update: holding steady. Neck scan this Friday.

288,"I haven't written in a while and I apologize. It's turned out to be a busy week, marked by
two dissertation defenses since last Thursday, one in Art History the other in FFS (French
and Francophone Studies). I had to move into high gear work-wise, a mode that has
become less familiar to me since I retired (in terms of serving on committees etc.), and
was determined to bring my 'A game' to the defenses. This was especially true in the
case of this past Tuesday's defense, as the student defending, Morgane, is my advisee,
with whom I've worked closely over the past several years. As Morgane is in all likelihood
my last advisee, and as she's a particularly impressive younger scholar, I was committed
to ensuring that all would go well (in terms of not only logistics for this zoom defense but
also the quality of the discussion, lines of questioning etc.). All went as planned: Morgane
presented a fascinating project on unpublished life-writings from the Alsace-Lorraine
borderland during the period when this region underwent multiple sovereignty changes
and experienced two wars (1870, 1914-1918). The discussion with the committee (which
included an outside member from the History department) was stimulating and rigorous,
ranging over questions of gender, Morgane's positioning in terms of the events and
themes she presented, material culture, future plans for this manuscript and more. The
discussion and my reading of Morgane's dissertation actually made me give a lot of
thought to my own practice as a diarist/blogger. I found after both defenses that I had
really been missing that level of discussion with colleagues and students, and felt good
about Morgane's work as well as that of the dozen or so other doctoral students I've
helped launch into academic positions during my time at Penn State (several have
become close friends since). As happens often in these situations, it makes me reflect
that, had I stayed on for five more years or so at Penn State, I could have/would have
done more: more students advised, another book written (not out of the question,
actually!), a Fulbright or other major grant scored, more extended stays in France,
collaborative work with international colleagues. ""I coulda been a contender."" Oh well.
It's a regret, for sure, but knowing that I can't do anything about it I try not to let that
realization get me down.
I drove up to campus after the defense - bearing champagne - for a lovely celebratory
lunch in our conference room in Morgane's honor. She's off to take up a position as
Assistant Prof. of French at High Point University in NC; her husband Aaron has a VAP
position at Wake Forest (VAP = Visiting Assistant Professor).
I find that having discrete, manageable goals (such as preparing for two dissertation
defenses within a two-week period) is a helpful goal for me these days. It keeps me
grounded and structured, and helps prevent me from going into an emotional and/or
existential tailspin, consumed with questions about how I should be using my
(remaining) time. My next goal is to finish off and submit a long article (to the journal
_Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide_) on Vever's collaboration with the graphic artist
Eugène Grasset on twenty striking jewelry pieces displayed at the 1900 Paris World's
                    
Fair. It doesn't need much more work. Then it will likely be back to editing Vever's 1899
diary; I'm pretty far along on that project as well. Colleagues at the Smithsonian and I
are also working on Vever's 1891 travel diary to stops along the Silk Road after he
participated in a trade show in Moscow, a fascinating document recording a trip that took
Vever and his wife all the way to Samarkand!
Anyhoo, after last Thursday's defense in Art History, I found myself preparing a batch of
rhubarb-strawberry compote, as I do so often (aside: some of you know about my long-
standing obsession with rhubarb - the color, the taste, the texture - resulting in a
cascade of compotes, chutneys, cakes, etc. tumbling out of my kitchen and my drives to
farms where nice Amish farm ladies will go into their gardens and cut stalks of rhubarb
for me -- ""If I die young, bury me in a pile of rhubarb, lay me down on a bed of rhubarb,
sink me in a river of rhubarb at dawn"" [!!!] -- Yes, it's to that point. I recall that my first
encounter with rhubarb was in 1980, when my French 'mother,' eighty-year old Madame
Marcelle Bloch, cooked rhubarb often. I remember that she always overcooked it and
that it was invariably stringy and of a grayish color, not that pleasing vibrant pink. I did
enjoy the taste, though).
In any event, I was working (too) quickly and instead of slicing a piece of rhubarb, I sliced
my finger with a serrated knife, deeply, seemingly cutting into/off a chunk of it near my
nail. It began to pulsate immediately and spurt blood (thank you, blood thinners). I ran
into the bathroom and tried to wash it, but that sent waves of additional pain shooting
through my finger. By wrapping it in four bandaids applied extremely tightly, I was able
to staunch the bleeding, and was then distracted for the rest of the evening by the
basketball game I watched  while lying on the couch. However, the throbbing pain was
so intense that it woke me up several times during the night and essentially I wound up
renouncing sleep; I thought I had severed a nerve. At 6:00 a.m. I said to myself out loud:
""I need medical attention."" I threw on some clothes and drove to the ER. Fortunately, it
was empty but I was assured that the Covid ER patients would begin to trickle in around
7 a.m. The nice young doctor and then his older attending doctor took good care of me.
When we removed the bandaids, the finger was still bleeding but the cut was not as bad
as it could have been. The throbbing may have been made worse by my applying the
bandaids so tightly. I also learned that long nerves run up the two sides of the finger. I
didn't need stitches nor 'skin glue' nor an X-ray. The doctors cleaned my wound
thoroughly and wrapped it fairly loosely in sterile gauze. The finger's coming along well
and I'm reminding myself not to rush when I'm cooking (and especially cutting).
Accidents happen.
I realize in retrospect that this was also a ""Jesus, take the wheel moment"" (wrong religion
for me, I know, but the image from the song fits). Sometimes I become completely
overwhelmed by all I have to do to take care of myself: make, note and attend multiple
                    
appointments each week (labs, chemo, magnesium drip, scans etc.); advocate for myself
when doctors who say they will call to discuss test results don't call; try to inform myself
about treatment options (I think I don't do a great job with this sometimes); arrange
rides to/from some of my appointments (the ones during which I'll be zonked out on
Benadryl; the others I can drive myself to); keep a running list of questions to ask my
medical team; pay medical bills; keep my house relatively in order, with help from a
house cleaner (not always 100% reliable, but fine) and woman who helps me with
errands; prepare healthy meals for myself (I try to make one dish a week that will last for
3-4 nights; this week it was turkey chili as I try to feature protein and veggies) etc. ""I
can't go on. You must go on. I'll go on."" Sometimes I really want for someone(s) to take
care of me. And I would be negligent not to say that my wonderful circle of friends and
family and neighbors do help immensely with that. And I'd also be negligent not to point
out that my being 'alone' (a word I find distasteful and misleading in my case) is to a
large extent my choice, as I often find it much *easier* and less cumbersome to do
things for myself than to have to involve another person in a 'caregiver' role, especially if
that person feels ambivalent about being in that role (of course, there are times, postop
for instance, when I truly need help, ask for it, and am only too happy to receive it). If
you know me well you know that I value my freedom above all (which of course is not to
say that I don't revel in my friendships and relationships, on the contrary), and have
politely declined at least one marriage proposal and two relationship proposals in recent
years, from guys who all went on to remarry, which is what they wanted (happy for
them!). Currently living in a completely existential (ie carpe diem, in this case) mode.
Well, enough on that for today, shall we?
One night thoughts and questions about the final stages kept me up for a while: can I get
hospice care at home here? How can I ensure a home death (which is what I want?). We
are not there yet, though! So at one point in the ER, I remember saying to the two
doctors: ""Please just take care of me;"" I think this ER visit may have represented my
acting out this scenario (of wanting to be cared for) in some way but it's hard to tell. I'm
not saying I cut myself *in order to get attention,* but once in the ER it felt so good to be
attended to by the nice physicians. The young one kept going on and on about how
much he loves rhubarb (wish I could have given him some!), while the older one simply
said, before exiting my room: ""When you look at your finger, which will likely bear a scar,
you'll always think of rhubarb compote.""
The rest of that morning was pretty crazy. I had a neck scan at 9:50 at the same hospital
in whose ER I found myself at about 8 or so. Should I simply sit in my car until my next
appointment, perhaps crawl into the back seat and doze? In the end, I decided to drive
home (about 20 mn.), crawl into my bed, and sleep for about half an hour. Then I was
back up and driving to the hospital for the second time, for the scan. Sitting in the dingy
waiting area outside the CT-scan room, I was treated to the sounds of the elderly patient
in the queue before me screaming her head off while undergoing her scan. My own scan
only took about five minutes (I honestly think I fell asleep in the machine). My next
                    
appointment was for lunch at 12:30 and at this point it might have been 11:00? So I
drove home once again, crawled into my bed once again, and slept for about half an
hour before lunch with my friend Sandy. Lunch outdoors in the sun at Duffy's Tavern in
Boalsburg was lovely despite my fatigue, and I told Sandy that I was very happy to have
my day officially 'begin' with lunch, burying the stressful, unpleasant morning. Oh well!
When I told Sandy about the title I was mulling for this entry (""It all began with a stalk of
rhubarb""), she reminded me of the first line of Ann Patchett's novel, _Commonwealth_:
""The christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with gin."" Great first line
and I love Ann Patchett.
Speaking of risky behavior (cf slicing my finger as if it were a stalk of rhubarb), I found
myself binge eating for a few days. In writing this, I do not know whether I seek
chastising, compassion, sympathy/empathy or something else. I'm a bit surprised I'm
even choosing to write about a 'secret behavior.' I think it's a bit like the ""Jesus, take the
wheel"" moments I experience sometimes; I become unregulated, and I don't care. I need
that kind of release and testing of limits. I found myself eating somewhat insatiably and
uncontrollably for a few days, even veering into some unhealthy and caloric foods that I
don't normally eat: a tuna sub from Subway (Subway! tuna, though, is the only sub I'll
eat from that place, and about once a year; I can't stomach processed sandwich meat), a
refreshing yet highly caloric and sugary lemonade from Wegmans' (ok, freshly
squeezed...); a bunch of sweets and treats from the Cake Shop by Tati, eaten in
succession (a croissant, chocolate chip cookie, and a carrot-coconut muffin that I had
told myself I'd save for the following day but in the end did not), a big bag of popcorn
(things with kernels are generally not good for me), some random candy from Trader
Joe's, an entire jar of pickles that I drove twelve miles to buy from a specialty store in
Bellefonte (Belle Mercantile) and then wolfed down in my car, savoring the salty, sour,
dill-infused brine and crunchy pickles. I think I'm back 'on the wagon' now and certainly
recognizable (yes?...) as a relatively slender person, but the temptation to cram my face
with copious amounts of food is still there. I think this binging also served the purpose of
giving me a little 'belly,' which I could subsequently blame for/confound with any
potential stomach bloating indicating new or recurrent cancer. In other words, I may be
trying to 'mask' a potentially distressing result. Further, Dr. Beavis' account (at my
request) of the final stages entailing losing the desire/ability to eat has me, I believe,
'hoarding' food as a kind of buffer and trying to ward off this eventuality as a squirrel
might stock up on acorns in view of the 'lean periods' (magical thinking?). And of course,
I do love to eat, cook etc. But in all realms I need to try to stick to 'behavior I can
sanction' (a phrase my therapist and I bandy about). But oh gosh, it's really hard
sometimes....
Both my MRI and neck CT indicate no recurrence. I had both Dr. Patel jeune and Dr.
Bettegowda at Hopkins look at the imaging, and spoke to the Dr. Patel's PA on the
phone. This of course if very good news but in all honesty I'm much more nervous about
my pelvic/abdominal/chest scan next Tuesday. I've been having weekly magnesium drips
                    
(two hours) because that electrolyte level is low. Otherwise, my blood counts have been
ok enough for chemo to proceed every week (as it did today). My CA 125 (cancer
antigen) level today is 13.9, well under the 38 U/ml limit considered normal. However,
after being told for months (years?) that this level is all important, Dr. Beavis more
recently told me that my current treatment somehow 'falsifies' this level, making it a less
significant indicator (well then, why do they even order this test? I need more clarity on
this) and to Dr. Patel, ""it's just a number."" What to make of it? I don't know. I will soon
know whether my treatment will change with the possible addition of Avastin to help the
Taxol work better. In my mind, Avastin is ""the drug that's going to kill me"" because of
the very small risk of a bowel perforation (in which case, per Dr. Beavis, it's ""game
over""). I see we may be playing Russian roulette soon. Per Dr. Patel the elder, in an
ominous tone that annoyed me: ""There will be findings"" (from the CT-scan). When I
asked him how he knew that, he replied that it's simply a matter of the natural
progression of the disease. I wish his tone had not been so foreboding. Of course it's
scary. I need a lunch (and will have one soon) with my local friend Deb, a fourteen-year
survivor who's undergone treatment all along. I've been reading in the NYTimes about
some promising new treatments for breast and rectal cancer. Wouldn't it be great if
'they' discovered some sort of 'magic bullet' for ovarian cancer?... I may not live to see it,
but hopefully it will happen one day. And through all of this, in the end, I am not feeling
too badly! My days are full; I do need to exercise more, but each day brings drives to
several farmers markets, cooking, some work, reading, getting together and/or
corresponding with friends...
Ben is coming home for a week on Monday. I can't wait to see him! And my cousin Julie
will be visiting from Florida later this month! Have already made turkey chili and will
make, this weekend, garlic scape pesto, asparagus soup, and a rhubarb-strawberry crisp.
No sliced fingers, promise!

289,"I will appreciate 'thoughts and prayers' (yes, even those!), well wishes, mi shebeirachs,
and belief in good karma today when I have my pelvic/abdominal/chest CT after many
months (it seems like this should have happened sooner but none of my doctors has as
yet raised a red flag about timing). Dr. Patel's ominous ""there will be findings"" and Dr.
Beavis' 'backpocket' option of adding Avastin to the mix soon are weighing on me, but I'll
await having my insides illuminated with the all-telling contrast dye to know more. For
now, it's merely a parlor game involving trying to parse the symptoms (is that a
pulsating lymph node lying against my stomach?). Currently off all food and drink for the
next four hours; scan is at 11:30, after which I'll go have some lunch. Ben is here this
week and that is such a joy. We were at Michael and Sue's last night for a barbecue (the
annual grilled hot dog that Michael always prepares for me), and later I'll try my hand at
cream of asparagus soup for dinner + salmon + salad. And between the NBA finals and
the Congressional hearings, we are all set in terms of our tv options. Hope to get out for
a long drive/farm stands or hike or picnic or equivalent tomorrow.",2,fear,0.8555602,0.007492988,0.008051345,0.8555602,0.0075587877,0.08989521,0.027019449,0.004421926
290,"When I finally summoned the courage to read the Geisinger radiologist's report on my
pelvic/chest/abdominal CT, on Thursday I believe, my mind immediately translated the
first line - ""Progression of disease"" - into ""I am going to die."" I ran into my bedroom to
begin frantically labelling and separating into ziploc bags all my heirloom jewelry to give
to Ben and other family members, laying these heirlooms into an extra jewelry box I had
bought for this purpose. I now understand that I was having at least in part a
physiological response to reading the report; fortunately, a number of relatives and
friends whose highly functioning prefrontal cortexes served to moderate my
impulsiveness and heightened 'fight or flight' responses, urged me to take a proverbial
breath and await further input from my medical team.
Which I did, both from Dr. Patel when I met with him on Friday and from Dr. Beavis via
email. Not unexpectedly (and I had said this to a few friends even before the fact),
several lymph nodes in my abdomen have grown in size, indicating likely presence of
cancer within. I could see them clearly and thickly on the image Dr. Patel showed me,
and they sometimes cause me some discomfort (unless I'm misidentifying the symptom).
There also seems to have been growth of cancerous tissue mass in my abdomen, also
not a surprise.
The problem is that we appear to be running out of viable treatment options. Dr. Beavis
told me this would likely be the case. I've been through about five or six lines of
treatment already; after a while, they are no longer effective. My current treatment,
weekly Taxol, appears to be helping in some ways -- tumors on the vagina, Dr. Beavis
noted, have actually shrunk in size! -- but not in others: several abdominal lymph nodes,
which of course can carry cancer to other parts of the body, are enlarging. Unless a
promising clinical trial can be identified for me at a place that makes sense for me to be
treated - Memorial Sloan Kettering, for example -- the next step is likely Taxol + Avastin,
a new drug for me. Avastin, Dr. Patel explained to me, helps Taxol work better as it
inhibits the cancer cells from creating their own, autonomous blood supplies that they
can draw on (yes, this disease is insidious, as Dr. Beavis has said; thanks, guys [or gals]
for not only setting up camp in my body but developing your own blood supply to
boot...). Tracy, one of the nice chemo nurses, told me that most patients tolerate Avastin
well. There is a risk of elevated blood pressure, some issue with a protein (my urine will
be checked every time), and of course that small risk of bowel perforation that could
mean for me, in Dr. Beavis' words, 'game over;' Dr. Patel, though, as well as the nurse I
spoke with, could really not recall this ever having been an issue with any of his patients,
though. A very scary prospect, nevertheless, and surely a 'leap of faith' will now be
required on my part, the relative riskiness of the treatment being the measure of the
stage we're at with it...
As for clinical trials, it is not certain this will be a viable option. I need to consult
                    
clinicaltrials.gov again and see if anything looks promising or applicable there. I may
simply try to get a consult at MSK if possible. I may need Dr. Beavis' help getting my foot
in the door but I'll also try myself, probably tomorrow; time to do the work, think clearly,
advocate for myself, assure myself I'm exhausting all reasonable treatment options. For
some trials, one has to have been free of brain mets for a certain length of time; my
brain has been mets-free for (only?) five months. Yes, cancer research is ongoing and
new treatments are coming available; but will there be one suited to my case/stage, and
will I be able to access it? Not clear yet - at all. At this point, I would not feel comfortable
travelling any further afield than places within striking range, close to friends and family
(Philly I suppose, Pittsburgh, Hopkins but I'm not seeing any trials going on there, DC,
MSK/NYC). Is this the right decision?
When I was with Dr. Patel, he looked at my imaging, sighed slightly (or was I imagining
this?) and said: ""Well, the good news is that your brain imaging looks clear."" Incidentally,
so do my chest and my liver, an organ I was concerned about. Actually, my liver looks a
little 'wonky;' one lobe is atrophied, another hypertrophied, several cysts, although not
cancerous, sit on its surface. To my relief, Dr. Patel explained that a liver can look like
this (is 'asymmetrical') when one lobe is working harder than the other. Dr. Beavis had
asked that Dr. Patel call her to discuss the options, which Dr. Patel did, immediately after
I spoke with him; he then stopped by the infusion room a bit later to update me on the
emerging plan. Another brief exchange with Dr. Patel - everything happened quickly, and
both doctors are so busy - had me confirming that I wanted to continue with treatment.
My reading of our quickly exchanged words was that this could be a point at which some
patients might choose to stop treatment, for any number of reasons. I told him with no
hesitation that I wished to continue; I feel strong enough and am certainly not ready to
stop. At what point I will wish to, though, is unclear. I will want to see how the new drug
combo works, if no clinical trial is available. Our goal is to maintain stability of the lymph
nodes or to have them shrink in size. I'll need further scans after a while. And I will make
sure all other viable options have been exhausted. I raised the possibility of further
radiation, surgery, which Dr. Patel dismissed (too invasive, I suppose, but need to find
out more).
The upshot of these fairly compressed discussions, on Friday, was that I did not yet start
the new chemo combo (I'm ok with this; I need to find out more, and it all seemed quite
rushed although again, not unexpected). Instead, I had my now habitual weekly
magnesium drip. This is another point of some concern, I suppose. I am having trouble
keeping my magnesium level up, although the chemo nurse tells me I'm not at a 'critical'
point. This electrolyte regulates many important biochemical functions, including those
related to the heart. Dr. Patel's first hypothesis was that I was losing magnesium
because of diarrhea, but now he wonders whether I am 'leaking' it from somewhere
(kidneys?). Another point of worry is a brown spot the dermatologist removed from
below my eyelid on Friday during a routine appointment (it's a new dermatologist as my
previous one left town; we had been watching this spot develop but to be honest with
                    
my focus on my other cancers I did not even stop to think that maybe a melanoma would
get me in the end!!). Calling it an 'ugly duckling' because of its shape, Dr. Van Ness
(whom I liked) said that she was ""concerned"" and sent it off to be biopsied. We simply
agreed that should it turn out to be cancerous, we'll ""deal with it."" Because that's what
we do.
Through all of this, I'm (still) not feeling too bad. My energy level is ok, I've been able to
take walks (1 mile?) and much longer drives that allow me to gain clarity and focus on
nature and the beautiful countryside. Lots and lots of time to think. Today I crossed
dozens of buggies filled with Amish in their Sunday best, rolling along Paradise Drive; a
group of about ten girls returning from worship in crisp blue dresses, white bonnets and
white aprons crossed my path and we waved hello. For some reason, the scene
reminded me of some of Gauguin's paintings of pardons in Brittany. I am aware of my
idealizing and likely somewhat voyeuristic fascination with this culture, but there is
something in its simplicity that grounds me.
And doing lots of cooking, buying produce right off the farms. Strawberry-rhubarb crisp,
rhubarb chutney, cherry clafoutis, cream of asparagus soup, garlic scape pesto, parsley-
feta salad dressing, a tofu dish in green curry glaze. Still binge-eating a little bit, feeling
like I want to 'ingest' life to the fullest. And therefore not sleeping all that much; my mind
is often racing. I'm determined to 'ingest' glorious June as entirely and joyfully as I can:
bring on the farm stands, the nurseries, the beautiful light flickering and filtering through
my blinds at about 6 p.m., the lunches outdoors with friends.
So yes, meanwhile, there is the business of living to attend to. I spent Saturday morning
in shul, at the bar-mitzvah of a friend's son. It was lovely, as always, to enjoy the
fellowship of a few congregants I hadn't seen in a while. Everyone kept telling me how
good I look, and I generally can't deny that! But I tend to have mixed feelings about the
comment; it can even make me feel angry, as if people are not 'getting it.' Part of me
feels as if I don't want to deceive, understanding that one can look great or at least
'normal,' and still be quite sick (Dr. Beavis and my own experience with others have
confirmed this point).
Although there's undeniably great wisdom to be found in each of the Torah's portions,
the one the bar-mitzvah explicated, about a first Passover the Israelites celebrated in the
desert (before the more familiar Passover story), did not capture my attention. But
there's usually some verse of image in the prayer book that does. This time, it was a
beautifully-worded passage (which I wish I could recall verbatim) about the burning bush
and ordinary miracles in our midst. Granted, the bush that burned without being
consumed by fire was perhaps no 'ordinary miracle,' but an extraordinary, supernatural
occurrence. However, it made me think about the 'ordinary miracles' taking place right in
front of my eyes, the work of ordinary angels in my midst. The friend who texts: ""I am
with you always."" A second friend who texts: ""Free to take a walk tomorrow?"" A third
                    
friend, a marvelous cook, who offers to shop, cook, clean for a dinner party for me, for
which I need only supply a guest list. Another friend who brings me goodies that she
knows I will love - a chocolate babka from Breads Bakery, cheeses from Zabar's -- from
New York; my dear son, a wonderful comfort and a sensitive, helpful and fun companion
all week, who offers to come over from his dad's one evening just so I won't have to
watch the NBA finals match by myself. I'll miss him but hope to get to the city before
long. I am grateful.

291,"It's been a somewhat uncanny, odd-seeming time -- time ""out of joint."" Following my
most recent CT-scan, I spoke with both Dr. Beavis (by phone) and Dr. Patel, in the office.
From Dr. Beavis: ""We still have options."" However, I detected a discernable and
purposeful (yet not vocalized) 'BUT' in her voice after that phrase. There are options...
but these are her so-called 'back-pocket options,' in extremis options (eg
immunotherapy-related options, which have *not* been shown to work effectively on
ovarian cancer), options that entail significant risk. Unless a promising clinical trial was
to be found quickly, Dr. Beavis indeed recommended (and Dr. Patel concurred) the
combo of Taxol + Avastin, the new drug that would be added. As I've mentioned several
times, Avastin comports a 5% risk of bowel perforation, which could be deadly. Dr. Patel,
though, as I've also mentioned, has never (or hardly ever) encountered this scenario with
a patient. So I will live with some trepidation. And did I mention that my new combo of
Taxol + Avastin has a *15%* success rate of stabilizing the lymph nodes or reducing
them in size? Well, perhaps I'll be one of the lucky 15 of 100 who benefit from this
treatment; I suppose I have other positives going for me (for example, not having any
other major health condition such as high blood pressure, heart issues etc.). The decision
to go with Taxol + Avastin was made pretty quickly, and in the few days that intervened
before I began that treatment last Friday (so far, so good, no marked ill effects; I'll be
scanned after about eight infusions) no viable clinical trials had been identified at
Hopkins nor at M.D. Anderson (or rather in the state of Texas), where my oncologist
college classmate/guardian angel Dr. Steven Sherman practices. 
In a late-breaking development today, though, I finally succeeded in scheduling a consult
                    
with a gyn-onc at Memorial Sloan Kettering for July 18th! I am feeling pretty jazzed about
this, because until now it's proved near-impossible for me to get into MSK. They don't
really like you to be in treatment when they see you (in case they have something else
to propose), but of course I really had to start my current treatment because I need it! So
on Dr. Beavis' advice, I very slightly 'fudged' what I imparted to MSK about my current
treatment, without veering into untruths, because I am feeling fairly desperate for them
to see me. This appointment is giving me some hope.
In another late-breaking development, my friend Steve (the one who originally got me
squared away with the team at Hopkins, for which I am eternally grateful) offered --
when I contacted him recently -- to share a summary of my treatment info with the same
colleagues of his who suggested Hopkins originally to see if they might know of any
promising clinical trials for me. The website clinicaltrials.gov, on which all clinical trials
must register, is not user friendly and contains quite technical descriptions of trials,
confusing for laypeople. I am hoping that Steve's colleagues can help me parse it and
point me in the right direction, if possible. I would consider going further afield than my
geographical comfort zone (NY/Philly/Pittsburgh/DC/Baltimore) for treatment but it would
depend on what is available -- if anything at this time.
I am not sure if there's anything else I need to be doing/pursuing right now. I am unsure
whether I should make some appointments, for example, at other major comprehensive
cancer centers to see what might be out there.
Dr. Beavis' comment during one of our late-night conversations when I was in the
hospital at Hopkins -- about her belief that each person should have the death they
desire -- has somehow recently functioned as a light switch for me. I broke through some
inertia (and fear? and anxiety?) and began to jot down notes about my wishes for my
funeral and burial, possessions, charitable contributions I wish to make etc. Dare I say
that it felt empowering and liberating? And being the 'creative,' the extrovert, and the
planner I am, in a very strange way I felt I was sinking my teeth (sorry for mixed
metaphor) into this 'project,' thinking through the myriad details much like I would those
of a dinner party, or a wedding, or a bar-mitzvah. Except I won't be there -- how odd --
unless I opt for something like a living funeral, which is not outside the realm of
possibility.
I'm choosing to embrace death positivity. This does not mean feeling 'positive' about the
the prospect of dying. As a joy-bringer, life-affirmer, highly affiliative soul, and party girl,
getting up close and personal with my mortality all the time right now pretty much
SUCKS big time. So please let's refrain from showering me with ""At leasts"" for now like
some sort of consolation prize in this awful game, shall we? (""At least you have time to
say your goodbyes with sufficient time""). Death positivity means a)striving to have the
death I desire and b)bringing death into conversations all of us should be having
throughout our lives (and I should have started much earlier), not cordoning it off from
                    
life like the...Black Plague.
I do admit the possibility, though, that my death positive attitude may contain some part
of denial. Major freakouts are likely somewhere on the horizon for me. At the same time,
though, I feel empowered, in control. At least for now.
Of course, I have no idea how long I may live. A rogue cancer cell could metastasize to
any part of my body at any time, and I could start not to feel well quickly. Conversely,
the MSK consult and/or *possible* clinical trial could help prolong my life. I could be
given two years (as Dr. Beavis has done) and live twice that. Or something critical could
emerge, and things could accelerate. So when to have these conversations? And how?
And with whom? And to what extent? Because meanwhile the crucial business of living
continues, and I am committed to it. Who do I want to hold close in the inner circle? Who
to keep in different kinds of roles? There is no road map. It can be confusing,
overwhelming. And I need to take care of myself. So I may lean more heavily on instinct
than I usually do. Instinct often serves me well. 
Btw, à propos of nothing but fwiw: I don't believe in an afterlife. I will not be reunited
with my loved ones in any type of space of place in the future. I ascribe pretty fully to
Jewish beliefs about the end being the end. Dispose of the body quickly (I desire a green
burial but there are no green cemeteries in State College, a dilemma), sit shiva, and
move on with the business of living. But I also ascribe to the lines we read in the
Kaddish: ""[The Dead] still live on earth in the acts of goodness they performed, and in
the hearts of those who cherish their memory."" Life after death continues in perpetuity,
but it will be memory- and affect-based. It will be different. What a strange thought.
I'll meet with my financial advisor and lawyer soon and deal with some of the nuts and
bolts of fine-tuning. And plan to have some of those Hard Conversations. But I'm leaving
plenty of time for buoying myself too -- dinners and lunches with friends, visits, drives,
cooking, reading, writing, outings, little trips, tending to my pretty front garden patch. In
an impulse buy yesterday, I scooped up some lavender incense cones and two small
incense burners, like those I used to love in middle and high school growing up near the
Village in the hippie-dippy late 60s -- and which remind me of my younger self -- tokens
of comfort.
There may be a part II coming with thoughts I've forgotten to include, devastated
feelings about the repeal of Roe and the current and future state of the country in
general,  plus an account of my fun weekend with Julie, my OG ride or die
pal/sister/cousin, who flew up from Florida to spend the weekend with me. For now,

292,"Pretty much status quo on the health front. Looking ahead to my consult at Sloan on
7/18; a few friends who are physicians or in biotech are also trying to help me identify
viable clinical trials. I've connected with a physician who is a 'clinical trials navigator' at
M.D. Anderson, thanks to Steve Sherman, but we have not actually spoken yet. She left a
very nice voicemail and I'll call her again after the weekend and forge ahead with
information-gathering. Chemo on Friday was unremarkable; I had forgotten that I'm only
receiving the additional boost of Avastin every other time so was infused with just Taxol
on Friday. My magnesium level increased a bit so only one extra infusion next week, not
three. And the suspicious spot under my eye that was biopsied turned out not to be
cancerous. I'll see my PCP on Tuesday for a routine appointment. My friend Zia has put
holistic-type treatments, and especially juicing, firmly on my radar screen (thanks, Z),
something I probably should have considered earlier on. I plan to buy a juicer and
experiment with all manner of greens, berries, ginger, turmeric, natural sweeteners etc.
Feel free to send along your favorite juice recipes! Meanwhile, my appetite still feels
voracious, perhaps attributable to the steroid I'm taking for lingering skull discomfort;
better than losing my appetite, I suppose. Not feeling badly overall.
I did not lack for energy during my cousin Julie's recent long weekend visit from Florida.
We had a wonderful, relaxing, fun get-together, tailored to our current incarnations as
63-year-old moms to sons (as well as older sisters to younger brothers, and daughters to
two sisters, my aunt and mother). This meant, for example, late afternoon rests, a far cry
from our marathon weekends growing up, exchanging visits from our homes in the city
and in nearby Fairfield County, CT (we'd meet under the big clock in Grand Central
Station); our hard partying college days, when once again we commuted between
Cambridge, MA and Amherst, MA, for unforgettable adventures; a high-intensity
interlude in Paris and southern France, where my passport was stolen and yet I somehow
was permitted, in these pre-September 11, 2001 days, to cross the border into Italy by
train without papers after a distraught leave-taking from my cousin, who was heading
back to the U.S.; and the several trips we took to see each other as married moms living
in PA and FL. The marriages ended (as did our mothers'), the baby boys have grown up,
but our lifelong bond endures.
Saturday took us to an arts festival in Milheim, and included lunch at Elk Creek Cafe,
antiquing, and a drive in the country, while Sunday we headed to Bellefonte for more
antiquing, admiring the well-kept Victorian mansions and strolling in pretty Talleyrand
Park. Dinner (duck!) at Central Reservation one night; the other evenings we cooked.
Convos often referring back to events of decades ago (and therefore requiring almost a
type of shorthand) mingled with musings on our current states, nostalgia working its way
                    
into some of those Hard Conversations -- thank you, Julie, for your loyalty, love and care,
and for the several important promises you made me without hesitation. 
A practice suggested in _The Book of Joy_ (conversations between the Dalai Lama and
Archbishop Desmond Tutu), involving identifying three sources of gratitude daily, has not
proven difficult for me at all! I am grateful to my dear friends Jim D. for having gifted me
this book, which turned out to be exactly the book I needed to read right now; to Helen,
for a carton of fresh eggs delivered to my doorstep; to Cheryl, for thinking of me during
what I'm sure was a packed trip to Santa Fe, returning with a pair of gorgeous blue
turquoise slab earrings for me (which I found tucked into one of my flower pots outside
my front door, along with a card bearing a meaningful Navajo quote about 'walking in
strength' and 'walking in beauty'); to Kathryn and John, for a box of delectable black
raspberries from the Amish (I much enjoyed our lunch at Voodoo Lounge the other day,
overlooking a tranquil gurgling creek); to my neighbor Pat, for baking me blueberry
muffins to enjoy with my iced coffee, delivered when she and her husband Dennis picked
me up from chemo on Friday; to Isa, for sending me kitchen gloves to ensure that I avoid
any trips to the ER in the future when/if my knife slips; to John O., for offering to cater a
dinner party for me with his phenomenal cooking! If I haven't mentioned you here,
please know that I'm grateful for many other acts of kindness (texts, emails, calls etc.).
Another practice suggested by _The Book of Joy,_ with which I was already familiar
thanks to my friend Shanny, is daily intention-setting. Recently, I set as my intention to
revel in the month of June, particularly glorious this year. This meant, of course, lots of
drives down backroads, enjoying gorgeous vistas, cooking with the bountiful early
summer produce, greenhouses and farm stands (I can't stop buying planters! My front
patio looks like a lush floral paradise, albeit a bit over the top...). Today I drove further
afield, about thirty miles away towards Lock Haven, to Sugar Valley/Loganton -- buggies,
a greenhouse, and an enchanting 1874 covered bridge, the last covered bridge, in fact,
in Clinton County. Last night was dinner outdoors on my back patio with my friend
Andrew: I made an heirloom tomato salad with ricotta and a good vinaigrette + a cherry
and black raspberry clafoutis for dessert, while he supplied his fabulous Negronis
(Stanley Tucci recipe; twice the gin!), of which I drank a few thimblefuls, ie small cordial
glasses. Lovely evening, great convo. I try to stay in the moment and focus on all the
pleasure this brings...
_Why I don't care for the 'fighting' or 'battling' metaphor:_ Yes, a non-seq here, but it's
been on my mind. A lot has been written on this by others than me, but I'm aware that
injunctions to 'keep fighting' etc. irk me. It seems to me that I'm simply doing what the
great majority of people would do should they desire to live. 'Fighting on' seems to me to
belong to a narrative we craft of control over disease, whereas ovarian cancer is nothing
if not insidious. I can attempt to have agency over 'winning' or 'losing' to the extent
possible, but at least some of it is completely out of my control. Moreover, 'battling' my
disease also means not only willing chemotherapy to kill off 'bad' cancer cells but also
accepting that the chemo is killing or damaging many of my healthy cells as well, a
                    
strange 'battle' indeed. I may be able to frame this more coherently going forward, and
for now I really can't say what type of injunction would motivate (or irk) me more than
the 'fighting' cliché. Perhaps simply meeting me and 'holding space' for me wherever I
happen to land at a given moment is the most helpful thing  you can do.
Enjoy the holiday weekend. I have such mixed feelings contemplating our flag. It's
become such a deeply divisive, multiple signifier. The local backroads are bedecked with
them, often paired with a ""Don't Tread on Me"" or occasional Confederate flag. In this
context, it's a symbol that, sadly, almost repels me, whereas it used to make me proud.
For today, I'll simply focus on all the goodness that has been manifesting itself to me
recently. I believe in the goodness in you.

295,"Health update: status quo. Chemo today: Taxol + Avastin + magnesium drip. No marked
side effects, but fatigue. Thank you, Janis, for driving me to chemo as usual and to Greg
M. for picking me up, treating me to an iced cappuccino and scone at Café Lemont, and
bringing me home (even while planning your own trip to Boston for your father's funeral),
where I conked out on the couch for a while. Three-month check-in this past week with
my primary care physician, Dr. Damaske. He tweaked some of my meds (upped my
Lexapro dosage; stressed taking high Tylenol dosage and antacids for sometimes bad
indigestion and abdominal discomfort), examined me (said he did not feel any
protuberances near surface; cancerous lymph nodes must be buried further under
surface); let me know how to alert myself to a bowel perforation, a constant source of
stress for me (basically, I'd experience sepsis>high fever and chills and abdominal pain,
warranting immediate attention in the ER). He's a kind, compassionate young(ish) doc,
                    
who (I learned, from the rainbow striped heart pin he was wearing) treats many young
trans patients locally. Highly empathic, he asked if he could give me a hug, which he did,
and I asked if I could call him Paul, which I also did (he calls me Willa on my insistence,
no longer ""Dr. Silverman""). Grateful to have him on my care team (and to have his
personal cell phone # at my fingertips if needed).
I am also in an information gathering phase regarding clinical trials and other treatment
options. I eagerly await my consultation with gyn-onc Dr. Seth Cohen at Sloan-Kettering
on July 18th. I am very curious to know whether MSK might have something to offer me
that might prolong my life  -- targeted therapy, immunotherapy, clinical trial etc. -- no
guarantee, of course. I have also spoken twice by phone to a 'clinical trials navigator' at
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, a kindly and helpful physician, Liliana Milojevic
(many thanks to my college classmate/guardian angel Dr. Steven Sherman for making
the contact). Dr. Milojevic gave me her opinion on a few trials that had been identified
for me by other contacts (Maria's physician son; Ben's friends Nikhil and Irene, who work
in biotech/biological research). While as Dr. M. noted it can be hard to assess these
aforementioned trials as they are *trials* (ie in the process of being tested), she seemed
to me to express some doubts about their viability (some would require much further
advance testing on me before I could even be considered for the trial, for example).
Rather, she sent me information about a number of trials going on at M.D. Anderson that
*might* be useful for me. *If* I were to be accepted into them (and we are *many* steps
from that point), I would need to go to Houston for treatment (and initial consult before
that), and possibly set myself up there for a while. I will also run the descriptions of these
trials by Dr. Beavis, who suggested that there appear to be no viable trials for me taking
place at Hopkins right now. I will query Dr. Patel too, but as a generalist medical
oncologist he is not likely to be up to date on the latest/best gyn-onc trials. And I'll likely
follow up with Steve Sherman as well. SO: information-gathering at least through my
Sloan consult, then assessing followed by Big Decision making. This keeps me up at
night (more or less every other night), but I'm also trying to proceed methodically and
make the best decisions for myself. Hope I am... Meanwhile, thank goodness, still feeling
ok, out and about, energy level acceptable, doing my stuff, seeing friends, finishing off
an article, cooking, taking drives, looking forward to my mother's visit next week during
Arts Fest and then returning with her to NY for a few days (will stay in Ben's apartment in
Park Slope after consult!). Amen.
Every day a blessing. Every minute, actually.
Over the holiday weekend (which was quiet and perfectly pleasant for me), I read Delia
Ephron's memoir, _Left on 10th: A Second Chance at Life, A Memoir,_ which (like Suleika
Jouad's _Between Two Kingdoms_ but in a most different style) recounts the writer's
grueling treatment (in a clinical trial) for leukemia and her *recovery* from this
seemingly near-fatal treatment, the ""poison cure."" I should likely be struck down for
occasional pangs of envy towards the author, who's in her seventies: she has means and
                    
name-recognition (and thus access to superior treatment, rooms etc.) and a remarkable
carer and adored second husband, a psychiatrist and widower named Peter Rutter, who
reached out to her after she had written a piece in the _NYTimes_ shortly after her own
husband had passed (a well-known writer, she is also the sister of the late Nora Ephron,
who died of leukemia) (http://www.deliaephronwriter.com/latest/after-54-years-we-fell-in-
love-after-five-months-i-got-leukemia). She's also been lucky. Like me, she has a
devoted, astonishing circle of friends. Lovely homes in the W. Village (my dream
neighborhood) and California; neighbors who formed a support community. My mini-
pangs were curtailed, though, by the dreadfulness of her treatment, centered on a rarely-
attempted type of bone marrow transplant (haplo-cord transplant>adult donor blood is
combined with umbilical cord blood) -- which worked. Anyhoo, a few quotes from the
book stayed with me; I share them here, at random:
>I was introduced to the expression ""casting crepe"" or ""hanging crepe,"" referring to
when a doctor forecasts a bleak outcome for a patient. It references the custom of
widows wearing crepe for a year after their husbands' deaths. I suppose I took Dr.
Beavis' prediction of my potentially shortened life span this way, while understanding
that I could be an outlier.
>""Being a patient in a hospital is the center of the world - a very small world, but I am
the definite center. Everyone is there for me. At the same time, I'm powerless. The
center of the world but powerless."" This paradox rings true.
>An excellent description of how a close friendship deepened further during Delia's
illness. I have experienced this before with a few friends: ""'What we experienced that
week was just the essence of what a true friendship is. It was sort of as if you and I had
gone on a trip together. It deepened our friendship in such a profound way.' It was, I
think, my vulnerability, her having to assist with prosaic tasks, and, mostly, simply the
amount of time we were together. Conversations with purpose, conversations with
depth, conversations that meandered.  Silence. Sleep. Yes, even after years of endless
phone calls and long lunches, we broke through to another level of comfort."" YES:
breaking through to another comfort level...
>On being a writer: ""My body may be gaining strength, but I am not writing. Both my
screenplay projects went south during my illness. I can't imagine sitting down in my
office at my laptop and having any thoughts spill out. This is huge. I am a writer first. It's
sanity and comfort. But it's gone. That big piece of me is in a boat caught in a current,
drifting further and further away."" It would take me more time/space/energy than I have
right now to discuss how my illness (and retirement) have affected my feelings about my
work, my strong identity as a writer and at the same time my conflicted feelings about
the same. A conversation with my friend Andrew the other night, though, about
safeguarding my work as an important part of my legacy, got me back to my desk
yesterday to finish up a long article that is almost done. I am motivated to send it off
                    
asap. And I've always loved personal writing, have an enormous trunk filled with my
diaries, dream books etc. and plan to also assemble stories, poems etc. currently lodged
in my computer for whomever wishes to read them later.
>A good description of my own 'flight' response; it resonates with me: ""I am curious
about many things and write about them - how people fall in love, why marriages beak
up, family madness, family dynamics, psychological cruelties, childhood, the nature of
friendship - but about the science of saving my life, I know only this: if I do research I will
panic, I will become hysterical, I will misunderstand, I will obsess. I don't even have an
appetite for it. I'm not repressing curiosity. I simply trust my ability to choose people and
then abdicate.""
>I was introduced to the expression ""friend-daughters"" and realized I have several of
these, mainly former graduate and undergraduate students who have become cherished
friends, special friends because of the unusual nature of our professional/personal
mentor/mentee relationship over many years (in part). I love them dearly. While I
certainly do not discount the extraordinary role of my male family members/friends,
women  have played and continued to play a crucial role in my journey. I liked this quote
too: ""I was amassing my women warriors. Looking back now, even before I decided, I
was assembling my troops.""
>On another note, a message from a woman (Kerri Grote) who recently passed from
cancer, posted on Facebook by my friend Chris O. (yes, I am still on FB, which great
ambivalence), slammed the ""cancer survivorship as a battle"" metaphor much more
forcefully than I did in my last post; kudos to her for helping me access my own feelings:
""But let me be crystal clear while I’m able: I did not 'lose a battle' against cancer. This is a ridiculous,
steamy pile of horse shit that society has dumped on cancer patients. Western medicine, and
Western culture, especially, is so uncomfortable talking about death that instead it created this
“battle” analogy that basically shames people who die from cancer. News flash: None of us gets out
alive from this rodeo called life. There is no shame in dying from cancer – or any serious illness. And
it doesn’t need to be a battle. It’s a transition that each of us will go through.""
https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3087224811563411&set=a.1493039927648582
Finally, I watched the TED talk, entitled ""What Really Matters at the End of Life,"" by one
of my 'guides,' the hospice and palliative care physician (and triple amputee, following
his having  survived electrocution following an accident in college), B.J. Miller
(https://www.ted.com/talks/bj_miller_what_really_matters_at_the_end_of_life). Watch it.
It's a compelling and clear-eyed talk that among many topics treats that of ""dying well""
(ars moriendi, something I hope to write about in another post). I like Miller's ideas about
aestheticizing death, replacing cold beeping hospital machines and isolation with beauty,
sensual pleasure etc. (he spoke about the delight of having a snowball melt in his hands
when he was hospitalized). I also liked this Miller quote so much I wrote it down: ""I am
asking we make space so that aging and dying can become a process of crescendo
                    
through to the end."" CRESCENDO THROUGH TO THE END.

299,"I wanted to write a brief post before leaving tomorrow for Mohonk. Rather, I will be at the
Geisinger lab at 7:45 tomorrow to have blood drawn, then will meet Dr. Patel before
proceeding to chemo. When that's all over, the 4+ hour drive to New Paltz. I've asked
the nurses not to give me any Benadryl to guarantee I'm alert. I'm slightly apprehensive
but hoping that I'll just ease into a driving groove, that the clear weather gods will be
with me, and that I can simply chill during the drive without excess fatigue. It's not ideal.
But it should work. Back Monday. I'm going to stay over in Tarrytown, NY after our lunch
                    
at Blue Stone Farms so I can be refreshed for my return drive on Monday. Ben will take
the bus from the city tomorrow late afternoon and I can't wait to have dinner with him at
Mohonk. The menus look enticing. Mohonk offers abundant activities but I may instead
wish to curl up on our balcony overlooking Lake Mohonk with a good book. Yay, r&r!
I've felt somewhat tired the past few days with some discomfort at top of my vagina (site
of several tumors), lower back, and side. I've needed a lot of sleep, including several rest
periods during the day, and have relied on Tylenol and Oxycodone when needed. Of
course it makes me worry about metastases (spine? brain?), tumor growth, progression
of disease. Perhaps my CT-scan, likely planned for August, will be moved up (I'll confirm
date with Dr. Patel tomorrow). I suppose I could still be tired from recent travel to NY,
stress surrounding the consult at MSK, bed hopping in Manhattan and Brooklyn, heat
wave etc. So...much...uncertainty.
The question ""Is it ok to simply survive?"" popped out of my mouth when speaking via
zoom with my therapist last Monday. I may have meant: ""Is it ethical to consume
resources while not manifestly 'producing' anything tangible or laudable in return?"" (in
my case: publications, knowledge, learning etc.). Or I may have meant: ""Is it acceptable
for a lifelong *striver* such as myself to shift my focus to surviving on the days that
seems about all I can handle?"" Or I may have meant: ""While *thriving* with cancer and
enjoying the best possible quality of life remains my ultimate goal, should I simply cut
myself some slack on the days this proves challenging?"" Or I may have meant: ""Is
survival enough to motivate me to press on?"" I grapple with these questions and don't
necessarily have an answer for them. I continue to set my sights on striving/thriving, of
course, but those around me (as well as myself) need to know and accept that some
days I might only hit 80%, or 60%, or not at all (Ben, remember when I had to sit down
on your staircase for a rest because I couldn't manage the four flights in the heat?). Still
quite a challenge for a highly-functioning person who can't escape niggling feelings of
guilt or anxiety or disappointment or of disappointing others...
Strive, thrive, survive: note that the concept of 'battling' or 'fighting' my disease is not
part of this triumvirate.
It occurred to me the other day that I am into my *fourth* year of treatment. A milestone
to be proud of, I suppose, but also one that lies close to the fateful five year mark by
which, statistically, half of OC survivors are dead. That passage feels ominous. How
much more of the ""poison cure"" can my body take? Is cancer taking a marked toll on me
visually (somehow, I care about that, although it seems trivial); do I look progressively
'marked for death?' At the same time, memories of the vacations that have marked each
of the four summers since my diagnosis are wonderful to return to. 2019: I was in rough
shape recovering from my thirteen hour debulking surgery at Hopkins and was very sad
to forego the trip to Lyon that I had planned for Ben and myself, but was delighted that
Ben and Sammi could go in my stead, enjoy a fabulous wine tour with a French friend of
                    
Arnold's, stay in a swanky hotel in a renovated townhouse, indulge in Lyonnais
gastronomy. 2020: Chatham, a fabulous week at the Chatham Bars Inn, an outstanding
hotel on the beach. Lots of local seafood, a day in Provincetown, spa treatments, a long
car ride filled up with podcasts, chitchat etc.; the Cape is one of my favorite places.
2021: East Hampton/Amagansett. Magnificent beach, seafood, cooking, the Hamptons
vibe, a visit with my high school friend Eva. Driving back to the city through Hurricane
Henri was scary, though, although we did make a pit stop to have some A+ Long Island
pizza. It was great having Sammi with us part of the time. 2022: ?.
Ok, I'm smiling now. Must go finish packing for tomorrow's trip. Be well, everyone.

300,"[Catching up; further posts on recent days to follow, hopefully]
Having begun to reacclimate after our wonderful Hudson Valley idyll (about which, more
soon) and also having begun to climb out of a post-idyll health-related slip into a slump
(about which, more soon too), I'm back to my State College rhythms: meals out with
friends (this past week at the Ale House with my gals Monique and Kathryn; this Sunday,
brunch at the Naked Egg with my gal Maria; next Tuesday coffee at Rothrock with my gal
Helen, to whom I just recommended the hysterical/poignant ""Fire Island"" on Hulu, which I
loved); to/from chemo car rides with my gals Janis and Jackie, mini-gab fests included;
country drives; farmers markets and cooking (delicious tomato/watermelon soup
adapted from the delectable one we sampled last Sunday at Blue Hill at Stone Barns
(more tomato dishes - pie? jam? chutney? - to come); reading (Colm Toibin's _Brooklyn,_
liking the novel/Toibin's style). I sleep oddly, punctuated by awake periods throughout
the night when I usually read NYTimes articles. The result is fatigue; must stay off my
devices!
Today I made my annual-ish trip to a farmers market about 25 miles or so away, the Old
School Market in - you guessed it - an old elementary school near Lamar, PA. Produce, a
flea market, a small animal auction, a food court, butcher etc.; I was attracted by some
very nice (and inexpensive) planters they used to sell early in the summer, but didn't see
any plants today. This trip also allowed me to stop at The Cakeshop by Tati, the
phenomenal bakery en route to the market (but a good 9 miles from my house), to snag
a few croissants and a tiramisu, my favorite dessert. Tati (Tatiana, the baker, who is from
Peru) produced my gorgeous birthday cake, the best cake of its kind I have ever eaten,
bar none (although I fondly remember my childhood birthday cakes, usually purchased
at the Gramercy Park Bake Shop [about which many more memories!], layered thick with
sugary buttercream and bedecked with plastic ballerina figurines in a circle on the cake's
top).
And I probably won't return to this particular market in Salona, PA. When Sammi gamely
made the trip there with me in 2020, the election campaign was in full gear, and a huge
Trump flag bedecked an entire wall of the market. It should have tipped me off, but
these displays are not uncommon once I leave the protective cocoon of State College. 
For the first time ever, I was actually harassed FOR wearing a mask inside a building!
The harasser was a central Pennsylvanian of a type that abounds in these parts: older
man (70s? 80s?), slightly stooped, baseball cap, short sleeve checked shirt w/t-shirt
underneath, and khakis. Nothing objectionable there. 
As I entered the school building:
                    
Harasser: Are you about to hold someone up? [I understood immediately where he was
coming from]
Me: Why?
H.: Well, you look like you're about to hold someone up.
Me [starting to feel I'm being triggered in ways that absolutely incense me; too bad I
didn't have my AK-47 on me lol, I could have bought all the ammo I needed from a stand
in the 'flea market' in the Old School; people have been shot for much less in this
country...] Actually, I have cancer, which compromises my immune system. I am wearing
this mask to protect myself, but also to protect you. Next time you think about masking,
perhaps you should remember me.
H: [mumbles something apologetically]. Does it bother you? [I presumed he meant the
mask and not cancer; I also now wonder if he meant no more than 'is the mask annoying
to wear?,' as it is for all of us to greater or lesser degrees that we simply accept, but was
tempted to ask him whether he meant ""does it bother you not only physically, but also
ideologically, politically, ethically, etc.?""]
Me: No. Does it bother you?
H: [smiles disingenuously] Sometimes.
I could feel my voice rising, with others overhearing our conversation, so I decided to
move on. In retrospect, I had wanted to say: ""Is there a policy *forbidding* the wearing
of masks here?"" AND ""The next time you see someone masked indoors, please put aside
your ideology, your crazy adherence to the lies of Trump and his cronies, and your
disbelief in science, and think of me, if you're unable to direct your empathy to a broader
circle of your human brothers and sisters.""
Having stopped short of a rant (I wonder what held me back?), I continued on to the 'flea
market.' There was no a.c. and it was sweltering. One vendor was snoozing at her stand,
another one remarked to a third: ""Well, some days are simply not good days. Do you
need any money?"" I felt badly for them, then came upon the stand selling ammo for
AK-47s, 9 mms etc. Again, not an unexpected sight around here in Pennsyltucky, but my
photo reveals all that is tragically, profoundly wrong in our country (or parts of it) today.
Let's decode: The ammo, plentiful and not exorbitantly expensive imo, speaks for itself.
The poster to its left, which featured at one time politically neutral American iconography
that has in recent decades been fully coopted by the Tumpers (American flag, eagle,
musket man) reads ""God, guns & guts (often amended around here to ""God, guns and
Trump"") made America free/Let's keep it that way."" And at the pinnacle of this triangular
display, a poster advocating Doug Mastriano for governor. Mastriano's views, should my
                    
non-PA brethren and sisters be uninformed, fall at the extremist fringe of his own party:
he made payments to Gab, an extremist social media site to which the shooter in the
infamous 2018 Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh belongred, for its
consulting services. In fact, Mastriano has long rubbed elbows w/anti-Semites and anti-
Semitism, which he now claims to 'abhor' (perhaps he's an anti-Semite of the Alex Jones
stripe, obsessed with nightmare visions of the nefarious influence of a ""Jewish mafia"").
Mastriano also opposes abortion *for any reason,* and has made this a cornerstone of
his campaign. An election denial activist, Mastriano has warned that he will decertify
voting machines in counties whose results seem (to him) suspect. Under the
particularities of PA law, he has unusually wide latitude to do this. And he laid out cash
from his State Senate campaign to transport supporters to the ""Stop the Steal"" rally on 6
January 2020.
Please come to PA this fall to help keep our governorship blue! But will Pennsyltucky
really go for ""the Jew and the Black,"" conforming to notable perceptions of former state
attorney general Josh Shapiro and Austin Davis, who may well lose in the fall. And please
keep our former lieutenant governor and current Senate candidate John Fetterman
(running against snake oil salesman and carpet bagger extraordinaire, Mehmet Oz), an
impressive candidate with an unconventional persona, healthy, even *alive,* as he holds
his first rally today in Erie, after suffering a stroke in May that by his own admission,
combined with other health issues, might have killed him.
End of rant. For now. But ""be afraid, be very afraid."" Then get angry. And then do
something.
After being traumatized by my experience at the Old School Market, it was lovely to stop
at Shemp's greenhouses and market on my way home, where I picked up some excellent
looking produce: heirloom tomatoes and a large head of garlic. And as most Saturdays
I'll stop by the Amish market run by the friendly family at Hillside Farm, five mn. from my
home, where the bounty of August is reaching a crescendo, showcasing swelling mounds
of green beans, eggplants, tomatoes, melons, okra, zucchini, peppers, cherries, peaches,
blueberries, blackberries, basil, beets, fennel etc. + all the Amish baked and canned
goods that I don't really care for.
More soon w/health news (no major updates for now, but as usual, some developments).
Be well.
I badly owe some emails. Will make every effort to get to them this weekend!

301,"As classes begin at Penn State in two weeks, my psyche finds itself hard-wired, even in
this second post-retirement year, to spew anxiety dreams. This one was a variant of ""I'm
the instructor in charge of a class, it's the first day, I'm not prepared, and I'm worried
about the outcome"" (do note that I've also appeared as a student in this type of dream
before). In the dream, I spend at least 15 mn futzing around with AV equipment etc. in
front of a large, full auditorium before introducing myself to the class. Surprisingly (and
I've had a version of this dream before too), the many students in the class have stuck
with me, are still in their seats, and are attentive as I start class, although they've been
noisy before class starts.
In writing this just now, I realize that I may well have amended the description of my
dream thus: ""I'm the cancer patient, I feel unprepared for what's ahead, and worry about
the outcome.""
Once again, at this 'commencement,' I find myself anxious about how I'll organize my
time going forward, what I wish to accomplish etc., with my identities as a cancer patient
and a scholar seeming to merge (and conflict, coincide etc.) in this instance. Part of me
is attracted to the thought of simply sitting around and waiting to die while the other
part, the one that won me over, is drawn to identifying some discrete projects to work on
-- while of course faced with a wall of uncertainty concerning next steps in my treatment.
My thinking often tends to be quite binary* in this way -- all or nothing, death or life, give
up or soldier on etc. (*except when it comes to my thoughts on gender and sexual
identity!). I'm also aware of not wanting to scare anyone, to not bring any further pain to
loved ones. While I feel some obligation to continue to 'live large' (for me, but also for my
friends and family), I also wonder if this long *slog* might be unduly wearing. Another
binary, I supposed.
For the very first time today, I realized that I also have the option of stopping treatment.
I won't do that, but not feeling well the past few days plus being consumed with anxiety
about my (as yet nonexistent, I realize) plans for endgame scenarios have only
accentuated my feeling of slogging...
If I stopped treatment, I wouldn't be able to:
*witness the leaves change color;
*prepare for a joyous New Year (5782) by cooking foods, preparing the table, joining
fellow congregants at services, observing tashlich etc.
*dangle my feet in a deliciously chilly creek;
*spend time with loved ones.
My scans (MRI, CT-scan) are scheduled for the end of August/beginning of September
(I've forgotten the exact dates). Obviously, these are major assessment points, which will
                    
help determine next steps, especially if there's been progression. My 'scanxiety' has
intensified the already perfect storm of factors that I am simply trying to hold right now,
ie:
>Last office visit with Dr. Patel put me in a bit of a state. He seemed distracted and his
best bedside manner was not in evidence. Instead, he complained amply about staffing
shortages (which impact when appointments can be scheduled and often delay them
due to lack of providers), issues with insurance companies, and layers of bureaucratic
impasse, which, as he said, were preventing him from helping cancer patients, especially
many of the younger ones he was treating. While he did not threaten to quit (well,
perhaps he did...), he made a 'washing his hands of it' gesture, to indicate that there
were times he felt that frustrated he simply wished to be done with it. I blurted out
""Please don't quit; we need you!"" I certainly get where he's coming from, and feel badly
for him (we need more oncologists in this town and Covid, plus the repeal of Roe, have
put huge strains on the medical profession) but I hope he appreciates how vulnerable
this can make patients feel, too. I would not unload my gripes about academia on my
students, for example. I just don't find it appropriate.
>Very low magnesium readings, which mean a number of important biochemical
reactions in my body are out of whack. I'm currently getting two additional magnesium
infusions a week.
>Chronic diarrhea, very depleting (and depleting of electrolytes such as magnesium).
Still trying to get it under control with additional magnesium infusions.
>Fatigue;
>Stomach ache; discomfort in various parts of my stomach, but no real pain. And vital
signs good!
>My CA125 level (measure of a protein, used to detect amount of cancer in the blood)
has doubled since last blood test, jumping from 11 to 22. It is still within the range
considered normal (<38), though. I've heard diametrically opposed views about whether
this should be a concern; to Dr. Patel it's 'just a number,' to Dr. Beavis, it's no longer a
good indicator for me (not sure why). Nevertheless, it is *one* indicator among several,
and I'm anxious to see whether it belongs to a trend or is an outlier.
>Watching a video created for _The New Yorker_ entitled ""Documenting my Wife's Final
Days on Social Media,"" another attempt to demystify conversations about death by
documenting them graphically and publicly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i-
TvqmjsBw The woman in question was dying, in her mid-fifties, of late-stage ovarian
cancer. While I found much to admire in the honesty of this documentary, the specter of
Kathy's physical decay gave me the willies, like the worst Halloween spook you could
                    
imagine. Scary stuff.
>Realizing at about 4 a.m. that I actually have no plan for endgame, have not explored
nursing care, home care options etc., which is likely what would feel most comfortable
for me. I did begin to inquire with some of the nurses in the infusion room today and will
follow up. A lot of this seems daunting and time- and energy-consuming, though. My
house cleaner, because she's facing challenges herself, cannot clean for a while, and just
finding someone to help clean and straighten my currently messy house is an ordeal. My
goal is to stay independent until I can no longer do so, but it occurred to me that I don't
have a caregiver! My friends have been extraordinary in helping me with all sorts of
errands, food etc. but I'm envisioning a much heavier lift at some point, one that friends
and family may not be equipped for. When that point will be, I still don't know! 
Hopefully, less slogging and more thriving await! Will see what the next days bring.",2,fear,0.94984144,0.0034676923,0.0020738887,0.94984144,0.0015661875,0.012917651,0.0054100794,0.024723021
302,"On days when I'm not feeling great, a text or call from a friend or family member feels
like a lifeline. So I picked up my phone immediately when I saw ""Jackie C's"" name and
heard her warm, slightly low, lilting Scottish accent on the other end, offering to come by
(or get together) and to pick up some groceries for me. Suffice to say that as a survivor
(of o.c. and beyond), Jackie gets how these physical>mental slumps work. We'll meet, sit
on my porch and have a cold drink, talk, or go for a short walk on Friday. It was also
lovely to hear from my dear grad school friend Vinni, reminding me that we were to
catch up by phone today (to my chagrin and uncharacteristically, I had forgotten to note
this in my datebook, so I needed to move our phone call to today, and look forward to it).
I think this 'survivors' club' may have some special intuition about when lifelines are
needed. And Ben has of course been checking in regularly. [And thank you, Shanny and
Martina, for your phone calls too, and Melissa for your text and apt poem by Rilke! So
good to hear from you. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm able]. I'm still not feeling great,
but perhaps a bit better than a few days ago. I was at my neuro-oncologist's yesterday
and was told that I didn't need to resume taking steroids for the discomfort on the right
side of my skull, caused by inflammation stemming from my brain operation in January.
The brain isn't really my main concern right now anyway; the problem's my
abdominal/pelvic area, breathlessness and fatigue.
My getaway with Ben was also a lifeline. Three summer trips with him since diagnosis! A
fourth had been planned for summer 2019 but my debulking surgery intervened, and so I
sent Ben and Sammi on their fabulous trip to Paris, Lyon and Annecy instead of my
joining Ben for the trip.
I surprised myself by embarking on the four hour drive to the Hudson Valley immediately
following chemo last Thursday, and it hardly tired me out. I checked into our wonderful,
updated 'vintage' room (the original lodge dates to the early 19th c.), with a working
fireplace, dark wood moldings, antique furniture, no t.v. (yay!) and a balcony overlooking
Lake Mohonk, to be viewed peacefully from two Adirondack chairs. Ben arrived soon
after. We now have a joke that involves one of us flinging open a hotel door to reveal the
other standing on the threshold in a new and unexpected location -- we've now
rendezvoused (sp??) in hotels in Besançon and Montpellier, France, my apartment in the
rue Paul Bert in Paris and now - Mohonk Mountain House (Ben, have there been others? I
think so...). Somehow, we always get a big laugh out of finding one another on the
thresholds of random hotel rooms in far flung locations in Europe and the States, which
then becomes the pretext for big hugs and more gales of laughter.
Although there were plenty of kids there, I liken MMH to ""camp for grownups."" We
observed many multi-generational families, likely returnees and skewing (although not
exclusively) towards preppy. A dizzying array of activities was available -- yoga, tai chi,
Pilates, water sports, hiking and nature walks, house history tours, music, meditation,
                    
tennis, horseback rides, golf, spa treatments + three (more than) square a day. I enjoyed
reading on our deck overlooking Lake Mohonk and the Catskills, a mild hike around the
lake, relaxing in the rowboat while Ben flexed his muscles rowing me across the lake (we
drifted ashore a few times!), a house history tour (as at Bedford Spring, decades of
iconography decorate the walls; unlike Bedford, MMK was the site of various
international conferences about pacifism and equitable treatment of the indigenous
peoples in the area); and excellent music, part of their annual Festival of the Arts (one
group, Miss Maybell and the Jazz Age, was recently featured on NPR; another, Birdland
Jazz Guitar, played lots of standards from the American Songbook). I found *everything*
at MMH to be of  the highest quality - no skimping). Yes, it is pricey, but I have such a
different sense of the value of money these days...; ie you can't take it with you... Ben
was more adventuresome than me when I couldn't be, easy enough to do in the perfect
weather we experienced: he swam across the lake, played golf; and climbed through the
Lemon Squeeze (a series of very narrow passageways through boulders) to the summit
of one of the most difficult trails.
Meals were served in about five different settings for us to choose from; in fact, there are
usually so many people at MMH (at full capacity, apparently) that one's meal
times/locations are pre-scheduled, but we were able to tweak our schedule a bit. The
enormous main dining room w/dramatic views of the property at sunset is somewhat
'upscale' and features 'continental' or vaguely locavore cuisine. The fish was tasty and
Ben tucked into various types of steak during our visit. The servers -- largely hospitality
students from abroad -- our server hailed from Poland and wore a cute bow-tie - were
lovely. We also took many meals at The Grange, an outdoor dining area w/checkered
picnic tables overlooking the lake and a large grilling/serving station set up in the center
(>camp for grown-ups!). Every day brought a staggering selection of grilled meats,
numerous types of sausages, burgers, fish, ribs, dishes cooked in cast iron pans (eg
cornbread), plus many other entrees, salads (shrimp and fennel), fruit salads, desserts --
all very tasty. We know how lucky we are!
We had plenty of time to be both serious and silly, to have bits of  Big Conversations and
make small talk, to collaborate on the NYTimes Spelling Bee etc. Recently, when I
decided (after speaking with my therapist) to try to shift to a 'process talk' with Ben and
ask whether he felt ok about how, when etc. we've been going about talking about
issues revolving around my cancer, he replied, ""It's all good, mom, I feel I can talk to you
about anything, any time."" Be still my heart :) I think my work might be done here for
now.
Sunday we left MMH around 11:00 and took the 'scenic route' along one bank of the
Hudson River, through New Hamburg, Beacon etc. (New Paltz, where MMH is located and
where my nephew Isaac will be headed for college in the fall, seemed to have a bit of
hippy-dippy vibe, à la Woodstock?). Tarrytown seemed affluent and was largely Legend
of Sleepy Hollow/Rip van Winkle themed. We found our destination, Stone Barn Center
                    
for Food and Agriculture (est. by David Rockefeller; the Rockefellers seem to own half
the town, as well as adjacent Pocantico Hills).
We had reserved for lunch at the gorgeous Stone Barns at Blue Hill, perhaps the east
coast pendant to Thomas Keller's French Laundry or Alice Waters' Chez Panisse? At least
that's how I imagined it. In this temple to organic agriculture and farm to table
gastronomy, we headed towards the 'cafeteria,' forgoing the several hundred dollar
lunch/dinner, thank you very much (only offered during the week, in any case). Out
'cafeteria' lunch allowed us to sample about eight or so of the dishes made from their
ingredients, all grown or produced on site (including all their meats and a variety of
interesting grains). In a clean but nondescript industrial looking space, an employee
served and explained to us what we'd be eating: the most delicious gazpacho I've ever
sampled (pureed w/watermelon) - I've since replicated it at home - roasted beets with
slices of plum and pine nuts, homemade ricotta cheese whipped up with ?, another
condiment (something pickled...), a slice of roast beef, a large spelt cookie filled with
blackberry jam, corn lemonade, delicious miche made from one of their unusual grains. 
We ate outdoors under a billowing white tent beside the stone barns, next to a small
stand selling Blue Hill's produce and products (I bought some luscious rhubarb jam). We
might have been in Tuscany or northern Cali, but there seemed something distinctively
American about the scene -- I've tried, but I can't put my finger on what that was. It was
hot, and my energy was fading, so we toured the impressive greenhouses on our own
(cumin plants, which I've never seen before, and many interesting varieties of onions)
before leaving.
I drove Ben to the Tarrytown train station so he could return to the city (we were not far,
in fact, from his late Berkman grandparents' house in Hartsdale, which witnessed many
of Ben's best childhood memories, shared with his Berkman cousins). As it was about 3
p.m. and I was feeling worn out, I decided neither to drive all the way home nor to
hunker down in Tarrytown for the night but to try to make some progress in getting
closer to SC. I aimed for Harrisburg, tempted by both a b and b I like, City House, and my
go-to old school Italian bakery, Alvaro's. The *long* (4-5 hours) drive to Harrisburg was
exacerbated by a rainstorm the last hour. I was exhausted. But I made it to City House,
where I watched a mindless hour of ""Ninety Day Fiancé"" and ate a piece of pizza I had
picked up at reputedly the best pizzeria in Harrisburg, in one of its many dingy
neighborhood. Like Baltimore, Harrisburg has much to recommend it (although on a
smaller scale, of course) but also many sad, blighted areas ripe for improvement. I slept
like a rock in my cozy room fronting the Susquehanna. Picked up some coffee the next
morning at Little Amps, a cute café in the capital's renovated historic district downtown.
The owners of Alvaro's must have thought I was strange to have taken such a detour --
or obsessed with their cookies and pasta (which I am) -- when they saw how crestfallen I
looked to find their bakery closed just as they were putting out garbage cans and getting
into their car to head off on vacation. I had forgotten that the shop is closed the first two
                    
weeks in August. I wished them a lovely vacation, then retreated like a sad dog with her
tail between her legs. I'll be back, I hope. Road trip?
Health updates: received magnesium infusion yesterday. Have additional med to take for
diarrhea, hoping my abdomen will calm down over weekend. Dr. Patel, who stopped by
the infusion room yesterday (waking me up from a pleasant nap), suggested upping my
pain med dosage, said fatigue, breathless caused by lowered red blood cells from
chemo. I'm inferring there is no way to 'fix' this, but I forgot to ask that explicitly. I'll do
so on Tuesday, when I have a next mag infusion. Still short of breath, tired - ugh - but
likely no worse. Back to chemo next week unless things change. MSK still 'tracking' me,
wanting to know my treatment schedule etc. I'm glad.
 
My friend Melissa sent me a quote from Rilke (""Letters to a Young Poet,"" pub. 1929) that
resonated with me in this particular moment:
“So you mustn’t be frightened, if a sadness rises in front of you, larger than any you
have ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloud-shadows, moves over your hands and
over everything you do. You must realize that something is happening to you, that life
has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall.""

304,"Overall, I'm not feeling too badly, with some ups and downs. I was able to move my MRI
up about five days, from Sept. 2 to August 29th, as I was experiencing headaches earlier
in the week (in the front of my head) and this makes me extremely anxious. Fortunately,
the headaches seem to have subsided but I'm nevertheless eager (yet anxious as hell) to
know if any brain mets have recurred. CT-scan set for 9/6. Thanks to a good suggestion
by Dr. Beavis, I'm seeing a palliative care doctor here on Aug. 29th. Dr. Beavis again
stressed to me that palliative care is *not* the same thing as hospice: so far, *none* of
my doctors has mentioned the possibility of my stopping treatment and entering into the
next phase. 'Palliative care' has to do with pain management in serious illness (at least
that's how I understand it), and tends to treat the 'whole person' rather than a patient to
whom prescriptions are routinely doled out. Palliative care doctors might also suggest
'alternative' treatments for pain such as acupuncture, yoga or... tiramisu! The wonderful
palliative care doctor who treated me at Hopkins before my brain operation in January,
as soon as she found out I loved tiramisu, kept bringing me that dessert from different
places around Baltimore, so we could compare and contrast (she loves the dessert, too).
Perhaps not the healthiest option for me but... it was fun! I was surprised to learn that I
even have access to a palliative care doc in State College - I believe it's a relatively new
specialty - but this doctor is here once a week, so ... we'll see. The effects of Friday's
chemo do not seem to be too bad, at least as of now. My magnesium count is up a bit,
which is good. I had an extra magnesium infusion this week, during which I was annoyed
by the patient on my right blabbling loudly the whole time into her cell phone, despite
my fairly violent ""shush-ing"" of her and several interventions by one of the nurses, and
by the patient on the left, whose ring tone also loudly blared an anthem by country
singer Lee Greenwood of which I'm not fond: ""And I'm proud to be an American/'cause at
least I know I'm FREEEEEEEE!"" 
Otherwise, my memory of the last two weeks or so is of feeling up and down. Some days
I was so tired it was a struggle to get out of bed or even make my bed (which I hardly
ever fail to do). A few nights I think I slept in my clothes; I had no energy. Then I began
perking up (perhaps the effects of the  Avastin had been wearing me down and were
subsequently wearing off?) and regaining energy. Dr. Beavis found me looking ""vibrant
and fantastic"" in a picture I sent her of Ben and me at Mohonk. Ridin' the roller coaster.
My sleep is still very erratic. Last night I slept about eleven hours, soundly. The night
before I barely slept two or three. I was worrying about my long end-stage 'to do' list:
need to downsize, make appointment with lawyer and tweak my will a bit, see rabbi
about funeral arrangements, finalize list of my wishes (now a hodge-podge of notes and
ideas). Needless to say, *nothing is (or appears to be) imminent;* I guess I'm just hard-
wired to be worried about one 'to-do list' or another. 
It is comforting, helpful and fun to have Ben home, for a week in this case.  Ben played
                    
golf with Michael a few times and spent time at his home, but Michael was nice enough
to offer to have Ben sleep at my house the whole time, so he could help me out. Ben was
working during the day, but we were able to make/share some good meals (my cooking
gene kicked in and produced heirloom tomato tart, pasta with pesto and scallops, spicy
roast carrot salad, peach crostada, tomato, basil and mozza salad, tomato jam and
more). He helped me with lots of chores around the house. Michael and Sue grilled
burgers and hot dogs for us one night at their place. Ben and I watched _The Deer
Hunter,_ which I don't believe I had seen since it came out. Powerful, amazing movie that
has stood the test of time. Stunning acting by the young Robert de Niro, Christopher
Walken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale. It had me remembering two young men I knew in the
early 70s, when they were just home from 'nam (one was a guy I worked with at NYU
library, when I had my first summer job as a shelver; the other was the son of the
superintendent of our apartment building in NY - he would just sit on the fire escape and
smoke cigarettes all day, and I had a few strange conversations with him). 
The sun was shining on the graduation of my (ostensibly) last Ph.D. student, Morgane, a
wonderful occasion. Morgane's husband, Aaron, also received his doctorate that day
about a week ago. The ceremony itself is a bit 'meh,' but I was grateful to be around to
join Morgane on this day that marked the apogee of seven (?) years of hard work on her
part, and happy to have contributed in any small way to helping her reach her goal.
PSU classes start tomorrow and, like last year, I am sad (depressed?) not to be a part of
it (but yes, of course, grateful for the 35 years I did have, but still....sad). I always loved
the first day of class, certainly as a teacher if not as much as a student, loved the energy
and excitement, the bustle on campus, the anticipation, the performative aspect of the
first day: ""It's showtime, folks."" And I love teaching, working with students, and being in
a university setting. I had thought about taking myself away to the beach and holing up
for a few days with some good books (currently reading Salman Rushdie's _Joseph
Anton_) but the hotels I was interested in on the Delaware shore were all booked. Maybe
another time soon. This week will hopefully bring a few diversions, including a little road
trip to Alvaro's in Harrisburg next Saturday.
I had a scary dream the other night: I was driving in a car. I was alone and seemed to be
on a country road, even in a forest. It may have been night. All of a sudden, I saw a cute
little bear cub on the side of the road and thought, ""Oh, how cute."" As I went further,
though, I saw that there were other cubs, and a mama bear too. At this point, I needed
to be concerned not only about my safety but also by the fact that the animals were
trying to cross the road and/or were approaching my car. I drove on, navigating the
driving as best I could, as more and more menacing animals began to appear. Wolves!!
Soon there were terrifying animals surrounding my car, trying to cross the road,
approach or even mount the car etc. I focused all my frightened energy on trying to
navigate this horrifying situation as best I could, struggling to 'get through.' What a scary
metaphor for riding the rough waves of serious illness -- all alone, in this case.
                    
There was a second dream that I don't remember well. It wasn't as overtly frightening,
but it involved my being in a difficult situation: I needed to put small items (like a roll of
paper towels) back in their correct spot, but within some sort of absolutely enormous
space, ship, hotel or something of that nature; it went on for miles and miles. There were
some people around, but no one could help me with my laborious, Herculean task. I was
earnestly giving this daunting mission my best shot, but it seemed tremendously
difficult.
I owe some emails, dear friends! I am working through them and it's a pleasure to write.
Don't despair of me, as sometimes I get delayed by not feeling well, visits etc.

306,"Although I'm grateful for every day, this past week had a bit of a ""it just kinda happened""
feel. I do recall struggling with fatigue and spending a lot of time on my couch napping,
resting or reading. At times this felt discouraging. I continue to be plagued by diarrhea
(hopefully not tmi?!), which I do my best to try to control with medication, and by the
consequent loss of magnesium, which can feel very depleting and that this coming week
will again be countered by additional magnesium infusions. My labs this week revealed
another increase in my CA125 level; it's gone from 11 to about 22 to about 27. Say what
you will about this indicator being only one among several (with imaging likely the most
important one), I still feel that the increase over two months can't be a good sign, as my
own 'good' level has rarely risen above the teens. Chemo on Friday went smoothly, and
I'm grateful to both Janis (whose younger brother died recently) and Jackie for being so
kind as to continue to provide my transportation that day. My neuropathy, especially in
my right foot/leg, has become a bit more irritating. I feel I should be pushing myself to
exercise more, but find myself short of breath and fatigued. Still feeling a bit 'aimless'
now that Penn State's fall semester is underway; I continue to feel tethered to the
academic calendar, its rhythms and expectations.
Despite all this, things could certainly be worse. Please send your good thoughts and
energy my way beginning tomorrow, when I have my brain MRI at 7:45 p.m. -- in fact,
tomorrow I'll experience a quadruple-whammy of medical appointments, with a
magnesium infusion, meeting with palliative care doctor, and eye doctor appointment
added to the mix!
I did rally sufficiently on Wednesday to enjoy a lovely dinner at the Allen Street Grill with
my pals Kathryn, Sandy and Cheryl. And I perked up in a big way -- this can happen -- on
Saturday, in time for a road trip to Harrisburg with pals Maria and Helen, destination
Alvaro's Italian Bread and Pastry Shop, which Helen knew already and which I had been
vaunting to Maria for months. After a delicious breakfast there (omelets, sfogliattella,
cappuccino), we loaded up on Italian entrées for dinner (spaghetti and stuffed eggplant),
home baked Italian bread, Italian cookies and gelato. Lots of interesting convo with these
two and a convivial time. Definitely gave me a boost.
In fact, I surprised myself by my 'perkiness' on Saturday, as I had only slept a few hours
the night before -- this happens too. One [feature? advantage?] of this late stage of my
cancer journey is that the night hours often bring an opportunity for a 'deep dive' into
the history of a friendship, a relationship, an event in my life. Friendships, for example,
spool out onto the canvas of my mind with great clarity, allowing me to appreciate them
in all their particularity (how exactly *did* I become friends with that person, fifty years
ago? What memories do I associate with them? What were we like then, and now?).
While I'm certainly bummed not to be able to sleep on nights when I am 'visited' by
these cosmic forays into the nooks and crannies of my life, I don't become anxious
                    
because important realities are manifesting themselves to me. So for now I'll refrain from
""fixing a hole where the rain comes in, and stops my mind from wandering, where it will
go..."" I just let my mind wander...
Not overly tired today, either. I slept soundly and likely recovered my sleep debt from
Friday night. Finished up a piece I've been writing for Ben, then took a relaxing drive out
route 45. Leaves are beginning to fall. Many Amish in their 'Sunday best' returning from
church or out driving in their buggies in the nice weather. All roadside stands closed: ""No
Sunday sales."" Took a short nap and spoke to my dear (and only) aunt, Marlene Green,
for nearly an hour. Hope to make some zucchini pancakes with feta for dinner.
Saturday night I watched a memorable film: _Coda._ I know it's received flak from some
parts of the deaf community; I also know that it relies on some familiar tropes (coming of
age; inspiring teacher; rebellion against v. loyalty to family). However, the setting in
which these narratives play out, and the extraordinary acting, are so fresh, poignant and
original that I am still thinking about the film today while continuing to tear up, as I did
during most of the film! I'm reading Salman Rushdie's fictional memoir, _Joseph Anton,_
a long, intriguing book. I'll try to share further reactions once I've finished.

307,"Health update: I will have my CT-Scan this coming Tuesday. Then, it can take the
radiologists 1-7 days to produce their report. Obvs, this is the scan I am most concerned
about as all the other problems (including the metastasis to brain) stem from my ovaries
(or, more likely, my fallopian tubes). So this scan will include my abdominal, pelvic and
chest area, to assess recurrence and/or progression of my disease (which is likely, in my
view, from general trend of my disease over past 3+ years; increase over two months in
CA-125 marker; Dr. Beavis' statement that ""this cancer is not going away;"" under 20%
success rate [i.e. stabilizing the cancer or making it regress] of my current chemo
combo, one of an increasingly small number of ones still available to me). The CT-scan
will also indicate any metastasis of cancer to, for example, chest/lungs, stomach, liver
(on which there are a number of as yet benign exterior nodes), kidneys; assess current
presence of cancer in lymph nodes (have they widened, remained the same or
decreased in width?) and tissue; detect any new masses; assess size of tumors sitting
atop the vagina, causing discomfort. Not much to see in my reproductive system as
there is currently scant trace of it (exterior parts and a few interior ones still remain,
thankfully!); fortunately I put this 'system' to good use before my cancer.
That paragraph was pretty dense. Hope you could wade through it.
So this scan is all important. And I begin with it in this blog post to put the better news
into perspective. Please note, too, that I'll be sending the results of all three scans to
both gyn-oncs at Hopkins and Sloan-Kettering for their radiologists to review. I've noticed
in the past that there are often slight discrepancies between and among the reports, but
usually the overall impression is similar.
My full body bone scan, conducted to assess whether my cancer has metastasized into
my bones after I complained about lower back pain, shows ""no osteoblastic lesion."" For
those not in the know (including myself), 'osteoblastic' has to do with increased bone
production due to tumor signals to bone. It results in thickened, inflexible bone being
formed. From this and other indications in the report, I take it to mean ""no bone cancer.""
Yes, this is good news. It is also news that, deep down, I expected to hear; we
proceeded with this scan out of an abundance of caution. I note, too, at the same time,
that I'm ill-equipped to read/interpret physicians' reports and their technical writing,
generally, although out of necessity I've gotten better at it. My eyes start to glaze over
as soon as I hit the technical vocabulary (which essentially comprises the near-entirety
of the writings). My friend David Rothman, a poet, somehow seemed to master reading
and parsing these materials; David, how did you do it?? 
I had to run the next-described report past my brother and son to get their take on it.
                    
My brain MRI reveals ""Postsurgical changes [...] without evidence of recurrent or
metastatic disease."" I take this to mean, and my brother does too, that there is no
evidence of a recurrence of cancer in my brain or new (or old) mets in my brain. I was
slightly confused by a 'diagnosis' of 'secondary malignant neoplasm of brain' but this
appears to describe my original diagnosis, not a new one.
No evidence of metastasis to either bones or brain (including recurrence) is good news
indeed (once again, this does not mean no mets to other organs tb-scanned this coming
week). It *may* also mean - and this is what I would be most encouraged by -- that I *not
ineligible* for consideration for a clinical trial somewhere (hopefully, Sloan or Hopkins).
However, as noted, I will need to verify whether other metastases, should they be
revealed by this Tuesday's scan, would likewise render me ineligible  for a clinical trial.
Presumably, being treated for two forms of cancer would make me even more vulnerable
health-wise and a less 'attractive' candidate for a clinical trial. If the trial 'worked,' for
example, it might be difficult to assess which form of cancer (if I had two or more) the
trial was treating successfully. I may not completely understand all the reasons for my
'ineligibility' in case of metastasis, but I'm sure they are valid. For now, one day at a
time. I will meet with my neuro-onc's PA, Angie Klein, on Wednesday, to review the MRI
results.
In any event, the positive-seeming report on the MRI gave me such an energy boost that
I jumped into my car after just a short post-chemo rest and took my favorite drive to the
antique store where I'm a regular, the Beaten Path, where I bought a pretty Deco pin (a
blingy rhinestone bar with a large, faux aquamarine pendant hanging from it) and some
vintage greeting cards to use for upcoming occasions, then out into the countryside,
where fall is a-coming judging by the pumpkins (!) for sale at the roadside stand on Rte
45 where I usually stop (I bought two mini-pumpkins packed with wildflowers that I will
give as gifts). Have also seen gourds and mums emerging at Tait Farm and elsewhere.
Time to change my decorating scheme! Final stop: an Amish farm I didn't know; a little
boy with one suspender on, one dangling (cute) sold me some fine-looking brown eggs.
This past week was largely dominated by medical stuff, as part of this coming one will
be, and it was stressful and very tiring. On Monday I had four medical appointments: a
two-hour magnesium infusion as my level is still quite low and seems to remain that way.
At 1:00 p.m., immediately following the infusion, I met, for the first time, a palliative care
Dr., Nicki Vithalani, who is in State College once a week and the rest of the week at the
Lewistown (?) hospital. This meeting was very useful for me. Not only does she deal with
pain management in serious illness (fortunately, not really an issue for me now, although
she did give me a script for Trazadone for insomnia, which last night proved of no use
whatsoever), but she also helps patients navigate end of life care issues in general. She
assured me that, when needed (and even beginning now just to get the lay of the land),
she would connect me with a social worker (the Geisinger office is trying to hire one),
                    
who in turn could hook me up with home health aides, agencies etc. (*good ones,* I
specified). This left me feeling less overwhelmed by the process of investigating all this
on my own, then interviewing potential aides etc. I do need to see what my PSU-
sponsored insurance will cover. Nicki also gave me a DNR order to fill out and put on my
fridge. I told her that I wanted to die at home, as most people do. She also seemed to
function as the token 'friendly person' on my team, the one who compliments me on my
dress and my Skechers (!), asks me in detail about what I taught, if I am an extrovert
etc. Similarly, my relationship with my palliative care doc at Hopkins seemed to revolve
largely around tiramisu (!) and a similar 'holistic' approach to the patient as a *person*
(did Nicki really care that much about my Skechers (which she contrasted with her beat-
up slip-ons from Target) or was she just trying to be friendly? And I did think I looked
pretty cute in that new shirt dress from Paris, which I insisted on wearing to chemo even
most folks are there in their sweats, letting it all hang out including their bald heads!).
Smarminess aside, it was great to meet Dr. Vithalani and we'll connect again in a few
weeks by video chat. Glad to have her on my care team.
At 3 p.m. (following a short rest at home), I happened to have my yearly eye exam,
which was useful as I've been having some problems with close-up vision (e.g. reading)
with my relatively new lenses/glasses. Indeed, Dr. Nelson (a nice, youngish woman fairly
new to my practice w/whom I 'click' well) tweaked my prescription slightly (my eyesight
is actually improving, as can happen in more 'mature' age) and also gave me a script for
reading glasses if needed.
Home again for another rest (by this point I was fairly beat). Had a bite, then proceeded
to hospital for my MRI (at 7:45 p.m.). Somehow, I thought it was going to take 15 mn.
but it wounded up lasting an hour: I moved slightly when I became anxious, and some of
the images needed to be reshot. So after an hour of the sound of jackhammering around
my head, I waited another 20 minutes or so to obtain discs containing the images (to
send/bring/upload for the Sloan and Hopkins oncologists/radiologists to review). By this
point (almost 9 p.m.), the hospital seemed empty and eerie. Compounded by my wealth
of bad memories of the place from Ben's birth on, being there drained me. I watched t.v.
to unwind when I returned home, then fell asleep immediately (unusual for me!).
Tuesday, I had my full-body bone scan at Geisinger Gray's Woods (a much brighter,
cleaner-seeming place than the hospital). I drove there for 9:45 to have an injection of
some sort of dye, then returned at 2:30 for the scan itself (this also took about an hour,
but remaining completely immobilized for that duration was not necessary, as we took
breaks between shots). The technician, Eric, was pleasant. Nothing else is indicated in
my datebook for Tuesday. As I recall, it was one of two days that week during which I felt
really rotten, and spent much time on my couch sleeping, resting, or watching a bit of
t.v., maybe a little reading. Again, I felt completely drained, and actually convinced
myself I was going to die soon.
                    
Wednesday, I rallied enough to have lunch with two of my former colleagues who are
now (and always were!) friends, Kathryn and Monique. We ate outside at Duffy's Tavern
in Boalsburg on a lovely day and had a most pleasant time. Later, Abbye, a kind and
efficient woman a bit younger than me who helps me out with errands and tasks around
my house once or twice a week, came by to deliver my groceries, tidy specific areas of
my house, take out my trash etc. It's a help, and I could use even more of it. I normally
don't have the energy to do some of the intensive downsizing and straightening that I
need to do. Also, I'm acquisitive (if you haven't noticed...). My new policy is to give away
(often to St. Vincent's thrift shop) one item for every one I acquire. In any event, on
Wednesday I also think I rested most of the day. I felt stressed about my MRI results,
which I was awaiting.
Thursday, I had my weekly labs (I've hit it off with one of the phlebotomists, Patty; she
has a son who works virtually from exotic places like Bali [he's recently been in France
for quite a while] while his husband remains in NY. Scratch the surface of some of these
central PA exteriors and you will often find wonderful, interesting people!). After resting
some more (really seemed to need it last week, and let myself get all the rest I need,
'cos it helps), I met my friend (and eons ago, former student) Ted at Voodoo Brewing Co.,
a hip brewery set outside on a charming creek, featuring pub food++ as it's made with
the delicious seafood from Maine Bay & Berry, which the owners bring back from Maine
weekly to their shop above the brewery. Store + brewery is a winning combo, and the
place is always packed. We had fun catching up (Ted works in biotech and introduced me
to some interesting innovations in cancer research; his sis is also an OC survivor as I am)
and took a few pics.
Back to Friday, which was chemo day plus magnesium infusion. I wound up in the chair
for 4.5 hours. Thank you, as always, to Janis and Jackie for providing rides; Jackie was
even kind enough to bring me an iced cappuccino from Café Lemont as I was going to
miss their closing time.  However, as mentioned earlier, I received the positive-sounding
news on the MRI that day, and shot off into the countryside to process it in the late
afternoon...
Random note: I have a small host of side effects that I try not to focus on because they
are manageable. They include, for example, neuropathy (loss of sensation from nerve
damage) in my feet and lower legs). This does not prevent me from walking at all, but I
need to be careful about balance or getting up too quickly, as I broke a bone in my ankle
this way two years ago. I got up too quickly after sitting for along time and went crashing
onto the floor as I had essentially lost feeling in my feet/legs. Another effect I have
noticed affects, strangely, my voice. I used to have a lovely singing and speaking voice.
Now I notice a markedly less lovely singing voice and a bit of 'vocal fry' and odd
monotone quality to my voice. No one has mentioned this to me, so I may be overly-
conscious of it, but it's annoying! But again, in the scheme of things... Avastin, finally,
seems to stimulate my mucous membranes. Lots of sneezing of mucous, some blood.
                    
Lovely, I know. But still, I try not to 'sweat the small stuff.' LOL.
Random stuff: I think my 'roller coaster' metaphor is getting tired. Yes, my life is filled
with 'ups and downs' (e.g. ""I'm about to die,"" ""I could live much longer than expected""),
anticipation, uncertainty, fear, very occasional moments of exhilaration. But usually the
fight seems more 'cosmic' (yes, a time-worn image as well...). Mythic? Biblical? Daniel in
the lions' den? Jacob wrestling with the angel? Struggles beyond time and space, at time
beyond meaning (yet also shot through with meaning). Many differences here too (not
sure if the divine intervention stuff applies to my story as well), but I may ditch the carny-
ride metaphor for something more appropriate-seeming.
Speaking of epic combats, all hail Queen Serena (my eyes are starting to tear as I'm
writing - this will be transition number III to follow) for embodying grace, grit,
determination, confidence and much more to so many. The Queen staved off six match
points and brought her opponent to deuce eight times. This Queen was not going down
without a fight! This Queen was leaving it all on the court! What an inspiration.
Speaking of metaphors (or similes) --  transition number II is here, wait for it! -- driving to
brunch today at the Naked Egg Cafe (lovely meal outside, solo) - I was contemplating
packing up some additional boxes of my French-related books (books in French/about
France and Francophone world) to see if one or two of my colleagues could bring them to
school to donate/sell to anyone who wants them. Next thought: but I'm not parting with
*anything* from or about the 19th century, especially those paperbacks of my favorite
poetry, purchased over the years (high school? college? grad school?). Then, lines from
my favorite poet, Baudelaire, popped into my mind *from memory:*
Je t'adore à l'égal de la voûte nocturne,
O vase de tristesse,  ô grande taciturne
Et t'aime d'autant plus, belle, que tu me fuis
Et que tu me parais, ornement de mes nuits,
Plus ironiquement accumuler les lieues
Qui séparent mes bras des immensités bleues.
https://fleursdumal.org/poem/121 [for the translation]
Swoon.
Next thoughts were about the gorgeousness (and macabreness, as the verses advance)
                    
of this poem, and reminded me of the joy it brought me, when I was younger, to
read/study/discuss it. It made me nostalgic for those days of dissecting literature (before
I moved more fully into history and art history). Why does the poet spell out the simile (I
believe it's a simile and not a metaphor, here?) so explicitly in the first line (à l'égal de)?
What about the interesting use of 'ironiquement' in line 5, likely signaling a host of
'ironies' in the lover's comportment towards the poet (she 'accumulates' 'spaces' - such a
vague word - that, ironically, serve not to bring the couple closer but to drive them apart,
a 'separation' upon which, bien sûr, the poet's attraction is based). A classic case of 'hard
to get,' but whoever used words to paint it more gorgeously? So...I actually started
*tearing up* in my car, both surprised that these verses are permanently ingrained in my
mind (even post-brain surgery!) and longing for those halcyon days (ht to Michael, with
whom, just about an hour ago, I was discussing the demerits of a sleep aid we used to
rely on, Halcyon!) of wonderful, creative, and intense group discussions of literature, my
first academic love.
So speaking of eyes welling with tears (transition III!), I was driving home about 6 p.m.
on Thursday and stopped at a long light on the corner of College and Allen, where
campus intersects town in front of the main gates to campus, traversing which one
arrives at the majestic elm-lined mall that leads uphill to the library, office and classroom
buildings. Town and campus were buzzing on this beautiful early evening: long lines at
bars as students likely sought out big screens on which to catch the first football game of
the year, at Purdue; students heading home after class and faculty and staff from work,
too. Penn State students dressed like, well, Penn State students: PSU logo gear,
backpacks, sweats and gym wear, young women in crop tops and short shorts. I miss the
buzz, being in the mix. I miss the many opportunities for creativity and hope that I'm still
using my creativity in other ways, even on a reduced - or different - scale. I miss
teaching and my colleagues. Cue the tears. I seem to do some of my best crying in the
car!
It's a relaxing holiday weekend. I hope to have lunch with my friends Maria, Mar and Jessi
tomorrow or Monday. May start cooking for the holidays; it takes a lot of time and
energy. *Might* go to NY next Friday; feel that I need a change of scene. Meanwhile,
next week: CT-scan, labs, magnesium infusion, therapist appointment, meeting with
neuro-onc's PA to review MRI results, but no chemo! Will likely have more clarity on the
path forward by the end of next week.
Hopefully, more writing, reading. Watched the movie adaptation of _Brooklyn,_ as I had
just read Colm Toibin's marvelous novel of the same name (sorry, I don't know how to
add the accents in Gaelic).  Saorsie Ronin delivered a good performance, but I don't
recommend the movie. A final section including a happy ending was added, whereas in
the novel the 'what happens next?' is much more ambiguous. Also just ordered a
Holocaust themed novel recommended by a friend, _La Carte postale_ by Anne Berest. It
won several literary prizes. Am always looking out for excellent works of fiction, film and
                    
non-fiction on the French experience of the Holocaust.
I am still catching up on emails and texts!

308,"Thank you to the many of you who showed concern regarding my CT-scan.
Unfortunately, my CT-scan was cancelled today and needed to be rescheduled. I
received a call from Geisinger scheduling at about 10:30 a.m. or so, while I was lying on
my couch in the sunroom, in the middle of my four-hour fast (those 24-hours fasts on
Yom Kippur proved good practice...). The technician had to leave on short notice, et
voilà. Next available appointment at Gray's Woods: late September. So instead I
rescheduled for this Thursday, at the Lewistown hospital. Fifty miles round trip; I have
enough 'juice' in my 'tank' to do it, but it's a pain.
All this made for a stressful day. I've not been feeling great, extremely fatigued, short of
breath, and with a low-grade headache all day (just today). I need a lot of sleep. The
                    
accumulation of the chemo drugs in my body wears me down, and this particular combo
seems to be hitting me hard. I feel so frustrated not being able to 'accomplish' or even
move forward with most of my normal activities. Please do remember how much fun I
am (was?...)! That's how I like to think about myself.
In a bit of better news, my magnesium count rose significantly, from about .9 mg/dl to
1.4 (1.5 is considered normal). I spent about two hours in the infusion room receiving my
once or twice weekly extra mag infusion.

309,"First, my apologies to NY pals I won't get to see in next few days, even though I miss
you! Feeling up to it, if still generally fatigued, I decided to take the train to the city
yesterday for a few days to see my family. We'll be celebrating the *97th* birthday of my
mother's partner, Arnold, a World War II veteran, and I wanted to be here for that. Lunch
with Ethan tomorrow, after I drop off discs of imaging plus radiologists' reports at Dr.
Cohen's office at Sloan-Kettering (still with the intent of ascertaining whether a clinical
trial at MKS might be in my future). Today, Ben and I are planning to take the ferry that
'contourne' (sorry - I am writing quickly and can only think of the French word!) Brooklyn,
making stops at Atlantic Avenue, Bay Ridge and other stops that I've forgotten. It's
raining, not heavily right now, and this trip by water is something of a bucket list item for
me. Had we taken it twenty-one years plus one day ago, the Towers would have loomed
above us. It seems an appropriate gesture of homage and mourning today. I have many
thoughts about the enduring - and the transitory - meaning(s) of 911, and how they have
morphed over the past twenty-one years, but don't have time to write about that now.
Memories seared into our hearts and minds forever, as is the one of six-year-old Ben
asking whether there were children on those planes.
A brief preliminary update on the radiologists' report on my CT scan. As expected, my
disease has progressed in my pelvic/abdominal/chest area; that is the overall
""impression"" of the radiologists ('impression' in the report refers to their overall findings).
The report had arrived in my Geisinger portal when I woke up yesterday and as I was
rushing to drive to the train depot (the oldest in PA, from 1849!) I was only able to read it
once. I expect to have Drs. Patel, Beavis, and perhaps Cohen interpret it further for me
this week. Its language is technical and found me looking up words I did not understand;
I need to have the doctors put it all in laywomen's terms for me. Some lymph nodes have
                    
increased in size, one or two have decreased. I don't believe I read the word 'metastasis,'
but I would need to read it again. Pancreas is clear. There are nodes on the exterior of
my liver; up to this point, these have likely been benign. I don't know if anything has
changed. The area scanned still reveals masses (which I'm pretty sure I can feel). The
report contains additional revelations but I have put it aside for now, and probably won't
look at it again until I speak with my doctors. There's not much more I can do for now; so
I'll just enjoy my time in NY.
I was expecting the news, but it's certainly not pleasant to read. So many emotions:
anger, sadness, gratitude - at least for now. Why am I only entitled to 82.8% of a
life(span)? I could have accomplished so much in the remaining 17.2%... I'll write about
my notion of 2/3 of a life some other time.
Immense gratitude to my friend Lisa Sternlieb for accompanying me to Lewistown
hospital last Thursday for my CT-scan, keeping me laughing with her stories and our
gabbing while I worked my way through two large bottles of a barium drink
(yummmm......not), indulging my craving for French fries from McDo after the scan and
the fast that preceded it, and taking time off from her busy teaching/school schedule. It
was wonderful to spend time with Lisa. I only felt moderately (re)traumatized by
revisiting Lewistown Hospital, site of my ill-fated trip in Jan. 2022 (for which I have
Martina Kolb to thank - not for the trip being ill-fated but for her strength during it, and
her kindness). What was to be a visit for a simple MRI that frigid day wound up with my
landing in the ER in Lewistown, and then being life-flighted to Hopkins, as I watched
Martina become a tiny dot waving goodbye from the roof of the hospital as the helicopter
took off.
Gabe and Yvonne, you were in my dream last night. I think about you fondly, and often,
and hope I'll be able to write you a catch-up email before long... I hope you are both well.
I must run now to have a bite and then Uber down to ""Corlears Hook"" (which I never
knew existed) to meet Ben for our Brooklyn ferry adventure. Feeling quite
Whitmanesque...

310,"A brief update between a visit to family in New York (fun, if a bit arduous physically, but
more on that in another posting), from which I returned yesterday, and a drive tomorrow
to Maryland, for a telemedicine appointment with Dr. Beavis.
There have been many, many twists and turns over the past few days as I try to share
information with three oncologists, figure out the optimal order of meetings, and of
course arrive at decisions regarding the best path forward. I'm picturing myself making
arrangements with Dr. Beavis' nurse while on the train home from NY yesterday (I try to
speak as softly as possible, unlike the remarkable number of folks gabbing at full volume
into their phones, often for hours; this actually led me to a semi-altercation with a
woman on the train, but I'll skip that story for now); and conversing with Dr. Cohen's
nurse twice, once while a)sitting in the big comfy chair in the infusion room (I got 'stuck'
in the chair and couldn't figure out how to climb down, tethered to my port, to retrieve a
pen so I could take notes) and b)while driving around the Amish farms, necessitating a
stop in the long driveway of one of them so the nurse and I could discuss clinical trials.
Hope you could wade through that sentence, dense as a thicket.
The sheer chaotic pace of the past few days called to mind Jacques Brel's wonderful song
""La Valse à mille temps"" (""Carousel""), with its steadily quickening, dizzying pace:
""We're on a carousel
A crazy carousel
And now we go around
Again we go around
And now we spin around
We're high above the ground
And down again around
And up again around
So high above the ground
We feel we've got to yell
We're on a carousel
A crazy carousel""
I was on a bit of Brel kick yesterday as I listened to him singing ""Le Moribond""
(improbably translated into English as ""Seasons in the Sun,"" which many of us 'of a
certain age' remember):

I'll avoid the byzantine minutia of the past few days and provide a summary: a)
tomorrow I am driving to Maryland for a telemedicine appointment with Dr. Beavis. As
she can no longer 'practice' (including virtually) in states other than MD, I must be
*inside the MD border* to meet with her! This requirement of being in the state where
the physician practices was suspended during the height of COVID when people were not
travelling (and sometimes not even leaving their homes), but is back in place now. We
will review the results of my latest CT-scan and discuss the path forward. I had
considered various options for tomorrow such as renting a coworking space for my visit
with her or even hitting a coffee shop, but decided to opt for privacy, comfort and
presumably a good internet connection...at a suites' hotel in Hagerstown, MD (!). I'll pick
up dinner on the way down from Alvaro's in Harrisburg, then hunker down tomorrow
night to watch the premiere of ""The Great British Baking Show"" and/or to read and/or
write and/or take a dip in the pool. My appointment's at 4 and I'll return Saturday
morning; b)in order to meet with Dr. Beavis, I cancelled my Friday morning meeting with
Dr. Patel, followed by chemo. For the moment, the current chemo regimen is off
(although it, or another chemo regimen, may eventually be back on). Any chemo I get at
this point will have a very low success rate because I've exhausted so many of the
conventional lines of treatment); c)the possibility of a clinical trial at MSK is part of the
puzzle. Dr. Beavis asked me to reach out again to Dr. Cohen to get his input, so I did. His
nurse called me today to tell me that there are two trials that are, as we agreed,
""potentially possible."" That call raised my spirits significantly. Then she called me again a
few hours later to tell me that, after thoroughly reviewing all my information and the fine
print of the clinical trial description, I am only potentially eligible for *one* of the trials.
Learning that the number of trials 'potentially possible' for me had just diminished by
50%, I felt significantly less buoyant (but still a bit puffed up -- see title of this blog, with
thanks to Jane Mallison for the Latin proverb!). Even if Dr. Beavis agreed that this trial
represented the best path forward, I would still need to go through several tests at MSK
to confirm or deny my eligibility. The MSK nurse sent me the descriptions of the trial
from Clinicaltrials.gov. Of course these files were way too big to send to Dr. B through
the portal, so I am hoping that she will be able to locate their descriptions on her own
(she is likely familiar with them). d)I will gather information tomorrow and share with Drs.
Patel and Cohen on Monday. Oy!
Today I had a magnesium infusion, after which I took a lovely drive in the country. Yes, I
bought lots of gourds (pls see cartoon - guilty of #3 as charged!). The leaves are starting
to turn. I also bought an acorn squash that I'm cooking now, fresh brown eggs, and a
huge, gnarly pumpkin. It was a beautiful day here.
                    
Some of my classmates are enjoying a lovely class reunion in Rome as I write, complete
with a black tie dinner at the Villa Borghese. I would have loved to have hopped on a
plane, bought or brought a few cute dresses, eaten an incredible pizza, and cried over
beautiful art in one of my favorite cities. But as I often tell myself, ""this is what we're
doing right now.""

311,"It's easy for my mind to play tricks on me and embrace the worst case scenario,
triggered by certain key words in radiologists' reports and my oncologists' interpretation
of them. So I apologize if I gave the impression that I was at death's door, and hope that
I'm not turning into the girl who cried wolf. 
""Your time is limited,"" per Dr. Beavis, verbatim. No surprise there. But nothing is
imminent and no one is discussing stopping treatment. And maybe there's a magic bullet
out there, somewhere. Who knows.
I've been caught up in a whirlwind the past ten days - I'm on the 'crazy carousel.' After
returning from NY on Wednesday, Dr. Beavis and I determined that we would have a
telemedicine appointment on Friday at 4:00 p.m. to discuss my recent scans and next
steps. She (and all doctors, I believe) can no longer benefit from the Covid loophole that
allowed them to practice medicine virtually across state lines. As a result, I was obliged
to cross the border into Maryland to telemeet with her (thank goodness it wasn't Boston,
or Houston). I had to, in a quick day's time a)find a logical Maryland location for me to
land (I chose Hagerstown) b)unpack and repack (I was so short on time this consisted of
my dumping everything out of my suitcase onto my bed and putting a few items back);
c)try to rest and ready myself for the next trip. I enjoyed the September mellowness on
my drive down, with a pit stop at Alvaro's in Harrisburg for lunch (excellent pizza, also
picked up pasta/eggplant parmigiana for dinner plus a few lemon ricotta cookies for the
road). Arrived at the hotel about 2:30, a ratty Radisson (something that sounded like
cartoons blaring from the room next door; shoddy internet made me panic but the front
desk somehow managed to improve the connection shortly before I was to meet with Dr.
Beavis). Oh well. It was a good enough place for me to land for an overnight.
I spoke to Dr. Beavis for about an hour. Without going into too much detail, she
recommends prioritizing the clinical trial at MSK about which I've been in touch with Dr.
Cohen. She feels it's probably a good time for me to have a prolonged break from
chemo: the neuropathy that is one of chemo's side effects will only worsen, she warned,
and has already morphed into a bothersome case of 'restless leg(s),"" which sometimes
keeps me awake. My body has absorbed a lot of chemo over the past three+ years. In
my understanding, clinical trials at the top cancer centers often subsequently set the
standard for care; Dr. Beavis feels that now's the time for me to try a more 'investigative'
option such as a trial. The trial itself involves immunotherapy and another substance (an
antibody?); it is not chemo. One of the 'substances' is now marketed as Keytruda
(perhaps you've seen ads for it on t.v.), but is not yet used to treat advanced uterine and
ovarian cancer, nor is it used in combo with another substance.
My admission to the trial is definitely not a done deal, however. Dr. Beavis raised two
concerns about my eligibility. I have, this morning, queried MSK about these. Further, I
                    
would/will need to return to NY for screening tests to assess my eligibility. For now, then,
I'm not sharing further details about the trial itself as they are moot.
If the MSK option falls through - which I hope it doesn't - Dr. Beavis next proposed a
clinical trial at Hopkins (not yet tested on humans...!); she'll have the research team
reach out to discuss the trial with me. The third option, per Dr. Beavis, would be another
line of chemo, retaining Avastin and adding a drug other than Taxol. That 'back pocket'
containing the remaining chemo options will soon become tiny, although she and Dr.
Patel are not ready to give those up yet, especially as a few of my lymph nodes
decreased in size from the last scan.
Voilà. The plan sounds reasonable to me and I will pluck up my courage and energy for
the next round, whatever it may be. Schedule, whereabouts, travel etc. all up in the air
right now. If you're a listmaker, an organizer, a detailed planner, a schedule junkie (all of
which I am), you'll watch it all go out the window when you undergo cancer treatment.
Which is not always a bad thing.
My CT scan, for which the Hopkins radiologists produced a much more detailed report
than Geisinger's and which Dr. Beavis herself analyzed closely in comparison with my
earlier scans, shows, per Beavis, a ""slight increase"" in tumor and lymph node size. I was
relieved to learn that the progression of my disease has not been radical. Further, no
metastases were detected. And, since she didn't mention these, I presume that the
nodes on my liver's exterior are benign. Yes, it could be worse.
Oh, I forgot that she's put in an order for another scan that will detect whether I have a
clot in my lungs (which she considers doubtful) and she'll speak to Dr. Patel about
ordering another type of scan of my heart. This is because she finds my shortness of
breath somewhat surprising, given that in her view my red blood cell count is not all that
low. My breathlessness may simply be attributed to 'deconditioning' - must try to get in
those steps, pushing through the discomfort. I'm glad she's being thorough.
So it seems I have a break from chemo for a while.  In any event, I'll need to have a
'wash' (ie let the current chemo wash out of my system) before starting in on the next
thing. Hopefully I'll feel better as a result. And I plan to have a cocktail!
I was grateful for my convo with Dr. B. yet afterwards (perhaps understandably) felt
adrift, alone, drained and out of sorts. The hotel was in some sort of very spread out
office park cum mall so there was really nowhere to walk. I wound up having my dinner a
while later and then reading in this somewhat sinister looking room. The hotel didn't
carry Netflix so my plan to watch ""The Great British Baking Show"" was foiled, but I
enjoyed it when I returned home the next day.
Realizing I was in close proximity to several Civil War battlefields, the next day -
                    
September 17th - I decided to learn some American history on the way back to State
College. My mother told me that the 17th was the 160th anniversary *date* of the Battle
of Antietam, the 'bloodiest day in American history' due to its astounding death toll of
23.000 that day -- boys and men from Pennsylvania, Ohio, Vermont, Texas, Louisiana
etc., under the command of Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and other generals. The
anniversary apparently drew even larger crowds than usual to the 3.000 acre site in
Sharpsburg, MD, strewn with monuments and markers of all types, and special activities
were taking place (I jumped every time I heard the loud boom from the artillery
demonstrations). I took a self-guided tour in my car that comprised eleven different
points of importance regarding the battle -- the Dunker church where wounded were
taken, the peaceful cornfield that became, on that day, a killing field. I could go on and
on about what I learned and how glad I was to have made the detour. The crowd itself --
Civil War history buffs, scout troops, Confederate nostalgists, reenactors, families, others
-- piqued my curiosity. And ringing the battlefield, modest homes in small-town rural
Maryland, many of them boasting American flags and pro-Trump signs. Hadn't Lincoln,
who three months after Antietam issued the Emancipation Proclamation, quoted from
the Book of Matthew when he was chosen to run for Senate in 1858 as the Republican
candidate, declaring that ""a house divided against itself shall not stand?""
History's a palimpsest, isn't it? And just as we need to study the past to learn about the
present, we need to observe the present to learn about the past. This notion struck me
again while watching the first part of Ken Burns' excellent documentary about America
and the Holocaust last night. Antietam certainly took my mind off cancer, and I'd love to
talk more about it with anyone interested.
So looking forward to my girlhood friend (and then college classmate), Kay, arriving
tomorrow for a visit (lots of gabbing in store), followed by my mother's arrival, as each
year at this time and laden down with a round challah, to help celebrate the new year.
My phone is quite full and I need to pare down the amount of stuff on it before I post
more pictures...
Be well, everyone.",2,fear,0.808894,0.009648136,0.005010684,0.808894,0.0061394623,0.12445828,0.018562946,0.027286552
312,"Health-wise, this has been a deflating week. Yesterday, I found out that, in the end, I'm
ineligible for the clinical trial that I had very much hoped to be part of at Sloan-Kettering.
I had an appointment scheduled for next Thursday, to undergo screening tests, with the
therapy itself slated to begin on October 6th. I was eager to try immunotherapy as an
alternative to chemo, as I have heard promising things and my body has absorbed so
much chemo, which can be debilitating. An ancillary advantage would have been
proximity to my great support system in NY. Dr. Cohen called me yesterday while I was
waiting to have a magnesium infusion here in State College to let me know that, after
having re-reviewed all my materials, he determined that I've had too many lines of
chemo to be eligible for the trial. I'm not sure precisely why that is the case, but I was
feeling too stunned to query him about it. Further, I was mortified to learn that he had
called me about a week earlier to share this news with him, but I only infrequently check
my voicemails (lesson learned...) as I'm much more accustomed to receiving written
communications from my physicians through online portals, which I check every day. Dr.
Cohen acknowledged that the news was ""extremely disappointing"" and said that he'd
definitely let me know if he becomes aware of any other trials for which I'd be eligible.
So yesterday was a deflating day -- I went practically straight from the infusion room to
Gray's Woods for a scan of my lungs, to assess whether a blood clot might be the cause
of my shortness of breath (it's not - yay). Then I simply let myself relax for the rest of the
day; I thought about taking a drive in the beautiful early fall weather, but felt too tired so
headed home to enjoy the prettiness out my sunroom window while relaxing wrapped up
in a pashmina shawl on my cozy couch.
I will need to regroup and, with Dr. Beavis' help, figure out the best plan B. I've written
her already with the disappointing news from MSK. As I wrote in my previous post, I
believe, with her usual foresight she had already laid out options B (clinical trial at
Hopkins, about which I know nothing at this point) and C (another line of chemo, which I
discussed with Dr. Patel this past week, but in which neither of us places enormous hope
for marked success, ie stabilizing or reducing the size of my tumors/cancer burden). 
I will also look into, more seriously than I had when I thought MSK was a go, potential
options further afield geographically, especially at M.D. Anderson in Houston and at
UCLA, where I have contacts and where I have already initiated inquiries. Whether I'd
even fly to one of these places to meet with a gyn-onc will depend, of course, on whether
they are running trials for which I might be considered (not a given, by any means). And I
don't do well emotionally and mentally without a strong support system accessible,
especially when taking into account a presumably limited lifespan.
So these will be the next steps. But first the holiday -- my mother arrives shortly, as
every year in recent memory, to observe and enjoy the new year with me (and, at
                    
services, my congregation).
Fortunately, the week, which ended with a thud, began with an uplift! My girlhood friend
Kay came to visit for three days, after having kindly proposed the visit (she lives in SoCal
but happened to be spending some time on the east coast). We met when we were
twelve, in Amherst, MA (where my father was teaching summer school) in a local
production of a musical version of _Tom Sawyer._ Our friendship continued on and,
coincidentally, we both wound up at Harvard, even living in the same dorm our freshman
year.  We've maintained our friendship, but it had become slightly perfunctory, with
heartfelt phone calls, then emails, but only once or twice a year. Thankfully, we had the
chance this time to renew our friendship and 'dig deep' through hours of talking,
reminiscing, and setting off on fun outings in search of vintage jewelry and the perfect
cocktail. I'm just sorry that this reconnection didn't happen sooner, but better late than
never. We have so much in common! After college, we both eventually obtained our
doctorates and pursued careers in academia (Kay in English at UC Santa Barbara); we've
both recently retired. We're both daughters of academics, too, with one son each (mine's
27, Kay's is 28), both of whom are data scientists after obtaining their M.S.s in that field.
We're both Jewish. And our temperaments mesh well. Kay is *in part* ever the creative,
imaginative, witty, ironic, literate, smart lover of performativity -- and, accordingly,
brought with her 'costumes' for the two of us to wear for our day out and about in Happy
Valley. Dressed in matching Harvard t-shirts and baseball caps -- ironically, on the eve of
the Nittany Lions' big home game against Central Michigan -- we garnered the strangest
looks and comments (which of course was the point). Thank you, dear Kay, for your visit.
Running out of time here. Wishing everyone (should you happen to observe, especially) a
blessed, sweet, healthy, happy and successful new year 5783, as full in its cyclicity as
the round challah we eat at this time and as bounteous as the seeds in the
pomegranate. L'shanah tovah!
Food pics to follow. Somehow, somehow I've managed to cook all the holiday dishes for
our meal tomorrow evening - chicken soup with matzah balls, tzimmes, lokshen kugel,
honey cake, with brisket to be cooked tonight/tomorrow.

313,"Medical update: Up-and-down may work better than the roller coaster metaphor as a
roller coaster ride holds the promise of being thrilling. Recent developments have not
been thrilling. At all. [btw, for the discussion of 'up-and-down' v. 'roller coaster' I credit
Amy Bloom, whose memoir, _In Love,_ I am currently reading. Bloom helped her
husband, Brian, take his life in Zurich under the auspices of Dignitas when Brian was
diagnosed at 65 with Alzheimer's].
As I shared, Plan A, participation in a clinical trial at Sloan-Kettering, fell through at the
last minute when Dr. Cohen concluded that I had had too many lines of chemo to make
me eligible for the trial. Just today, after I had let the trial nurse know that I wanted to go
ahead with a trial Dr. Beavis identified for me at Hopkins (Plan B), I found out the last slot
in the trial had just been claimed. The nurse will let me know if the last participant is
deemed ineligible or if new slots open up, but when will that be? Ben convinced me to
stop kicking myself for the delay caused by my taking a bit of time (a few days? I don't
remember. The holiday, which I observe, also intervened) to find out about trial options
at M.D. Anderson and UCLA, where personal contacts had directed me. M.D. Anderson,
which I first contacted in July and where a physician named Dr. Milojevic had been quite
helpful, sent me descriptions of three trials for which I might be eligible, which I've now
forwarded to Dr. Beavis. At UCLA, the nurse for Dr. Beth Karlan, a prominent gyn-onc
specializing in ovarian cancer, was extremely helpful in a long phone convo yesterday,
explaining much about trials and drug therapies that had remained murky for me. She
dissuaded me from pursuing a trial at UCLA, mainly because of the distance, expense,
significant time away from my support system etc. -- and the lack at this time of a really
suitable trial for me. Moreover, I've been feeling caught between two camps of
friends/family: the ones who urge me to 'leave no stone unturned' against this insidious
disease and the ones who understand that far from my support system I don't fare well,
especially knowing that time may be limited. Hopkins, as my brother reminded me, is
always a safe bet as it's been my 'home away from home' since 2019 and I never falter
in my esteem for this medical center and its world-class staff. It's never been a question
of my trying to 'sneak behind Dr. Beavis' back,' either, but simply of looking into what's
out there. She knows that I've been exploring what other major cancer centers might
have to offer me, and approves my efforts. It's simply unfortunate that my investigation
*may* have cost me a spot in Hopkins' clinical trial (but again: no guarantee the trial
would have worked for me, no guarantee I would have been eligible in the end, no
guarantee that the last trial spot was claimed precisely when I decided to move forward
with Hopkins and not earlier, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.).
I await word from Dr. Beavis, but it seems we may be on to Plan C, another line of
chemo. The hope was to give me a break from chemo, as I've had so much of it, and to
try an 'investigational' option at this time. If in a few months this line of chemo only
shows limited success, as all the previous ones have, perhaps there will be an
                    
appropriate clinical trial available to me at that time.
There's still room for this revised plan to change, however. Of course I was feeling
disappointed today and got into bed crying after returning from lunch and learning that
Plan B was a no-go (also forgot to take my Lexapro, which keeps me even keel). Such a
fucking insidious disease. I'm hoping that by early next week the latest plan will be in
place.
Although I haven't had any treatment (except magnesium infusions) the past several
weeks of 'wash out,' I'm not feeling too badly. Abdominal discomfort, fatigue etc. not
markedly worse than several weeks ago. Still getting out and about, although of course
on a somewhat more modified scale than during my pre-cancer days.
Following our tradition of the past ten years or so, my mother came to State College for
the holiday. Somehow I managed to pull off a Rosh Hashanah feast. I began cooking
about two weeks before the holiday and relied on days when I was feeling more
energetic than others to cook or bake. On Sunday, I spent the entire day cooking,
straightening, and creating an eye-catching décor for the meal - with my mother's help
of course. I made: chicken soup with matzah balls, lokshen kugel (w/an artery-clogging
combo of farmers' cheese, cottage cheese and sour cream), tzimmes (prunes, carrots,
and sweet potato slices slow cooked for hours until they become caramelized; I added
ginger, grated orange peel, orange juice and liberal dollops of schmaltz), sautéed
zucchini, sweet and sour brisket with cranberries (tangy!) and for dessert, honey cake for
a sweet new year, blueberries, raspberries, and lemon sorbet. A bold Cab to drink.
Apples and four kinds of local honey. Appetizers: pickles, cheeses. The end product was
wonderful, but I must admit it was tiring. I had to lay down every two hours or so for a
rest. We were delighted that my friend Lisa and her daughter could enjoy the meal with
us, abbreviated as it was, unfortunately, as my mother and I needed to leave for
services. 
Services resonated differently for me this year, likely for good reason. I do enjoy the
prospect of a new year, regeneration and renewal, the pretty fall colors. But I simply
can't get behind the idea of God's infinite lovingkindness and protectiveness. A question
as old as  Job, but yes: if God is these things, why would he blight me with this horrible
disease and all the pain and anxiety I've experienced the past few years (which is not to
say that the wonderful times have not outweighed the bad and that my spirit remains
strong and determined)? [and, incidentally, why would s/he allow - sanction? - mass
killings of civilisans in Ukraine?] I of course know that there are 'explanations' -- or
rationales-- for suffering in our theology, but I just don't buy them (and I truly apologize if
I'm offending anyone's beliefs here, but I need to be candid about my own). A spiritual
wake-up call? An opportunity for others to appreciate their blessings in contrast to my
suffering? A chance to elevate my soul? An example of ""God working in mysterious
ways?"" A call to examine my own sinfulness and lack of repentance? I can't possibly
                    
have been *that sinful* this past year as to merit some of the physical agony I've been
through (I in fact breathed a sigh of relief during tashlich, realizing that the number of
sins I needed to cast off into the creek in the form of bits of challah was fairly minimal
this year!). And I can't accept that any amount of prayer, Torah reading or tzedakah (I
always make donations at the new year, and this year gave to the central PA food bank)
can ""alleviate the harshness of God's decree."" Sure, bits of the service, ideas, verses,
stuck with me as always. But I don't believe in the 'God' presented to us during services,
at least not in the conventional form...
So what do I believe in? I believe in the goodness in you. Call that godliness if you will.
Every caring email, text, phone call, card, visit, kind word, gift manifests blessing. 
Shabbat Shuvah shalom! Wishes for peace and peacefulness on this special shabbat
between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

314,"I hope I didn't come across as overly bitter in my post yesterday -- an image that's
distasteful to me -- nor worthy of pity - ditto. My rapidly cycling emotions in reaction to
                    
often quickly changing circumstances are simply part of the up-and-down.
I did want to leave a written trace of my lovely few days in NY in mid-September, a
family-focused visit.  I tried not to 'overbook' myself but rather to focus on one outing a
day, so as not to become overtired -- not my usual NY pace, but so it goes. Ben was kind
enough to indulge one of my bucket list wishes (although I'm not big on the whole
bucket list idea) - a ride on the South Brooklyn ferry, the regular one that transports
Brooklynites to and from, not any of the ferries geared towards tourists.  After a false
start during which we were thwarted from boarding the ferry at Corlears Hook (an
unknown to me NY locale!) b/c of construction, we regrouped -- soggy, cranky and a bit
tuckered out though we were after having trouble finding one another -- then Ubured to
Wall St., and boarded our ferry there, where the largest crowds were taking another ferry
to Ikea in Red Hook. How refreshing to leave the densely-packed island for the wide,
calm, quiet expanses of New York harbor and the Brooklyn shore line, ending up in Bay
Ridge. As it was raining lightly (and a Sunday), we were actually the only passengers on
the upper level of the ferry! It was also September 11, and such a peaceful trip in the
harbor felt appropriate; the one firehouse we passed, close to Ground Zero,  was busied
with a commemorative luncheon and bedecked with memorial wreaths. Such a slow-
paced, still place, the ferry, an offshore oasis. As I was afraid my wig would blow off into
the harbor, I shoved it in my purse and let the wind massage my bald head!
I had reread Whitman's ""Crossing Brooklyn Ferry"" (1856) because I love Whitman
(describing a ferry ride from Manhattan to Brooklyn along the trajectory that was to
become the Brooklyn Bridge) and knew his poem would resonate with (and aggrandize!)
our modest outing:
""Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to
the south and east,
Others will see the islands large and small;
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high,
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them,
                    
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the
ebb-tide.""
 
After our return to terra firma, Ben and I Ubured to Veneiro's (by now, you may know
that I have a 'thing' for Italian pastries - and pastry shops, and this 1885 shop is one of
the best) for luscious cake (tiramisu cake for me) and cappuccino.
 
Another treat was to have my brother meet me at Sloan-Kettering, where I was dropping
off discs in anticipation of moving forward with a clinical trial there, and join me for
lunch. We headed to Rosa Mexicano, relaxed, and had a good chat. I think we may have
misordered as I usually enjoy whatever I get there, but it wasn't a big deal. Ethan's
Bloody Mary with Mezcal was yummy, and I had some sort of tasty mocktail. After lunch I
headed to Kalustyan, NY's legendary global foods store, and bought some rose harissa
(I'm not sure why, I think it's a required ingredient in some Ottolenghi recipe I'm
interested in), candied citron for my Rosh Hashanah honey cake, their delicious house-
made labneh with a bit of apricot jam, and a tiny piece of halvah - because it's so good.
 
I indulged in a manicure -- teal nails for Ovarian Cancer Awareness month.
 
The next night we enjoyed a celebratory dinner organized and offered by my mother--
one of the raisons d'être for my visit -- for her partner, Arnold. 97 years old! A World War
II veteran who saw combat in France and Germany (all praise and honor to him for that),
Arnold is also a volunteer tour guide with the Big Apple Greeters in New York. The food
was excellent and we were delighted to be together. When I asked Arnold what life
lessons he could share with us, he said: ""Be tolerant."" Excellent advice for the
generations to come.

315,"Chugging along here, determinedly. Medical update: The plan is still for me to start
receiving a new line of chemo this Friday unless by some miracle a slot opens up in the
Phase I trial at Hopkins that Dr. Beavis had designated as Plan B. She also encouraged
me to schedule a consult at M.D. Anderson, a premiere cancer center in Houston, to see
if they might have something to offer me. Of a list of three trials at M.D. Anderson that
had been identified to me in July by Dr. Ljiljana Milojevic, the very helpful coordinator of
clinical research programs in gyn-onc there, at least one looked of interest to Dr. Beavis
when I shared the descriptions with her. But M.D. Anderson is running lots of trials, all
the time, so it is possible/probably that others will be potentially available to me once I
finish the next line of chemo (I'm not sure when that will be; I'll need to be treated for a
few cycles at least, and then scanned).
Right now I'm particularly interested in trials involving immunotherapy, which would rely
on my immune system to fight my cancer, although other newish treatments may well
be available to me too. Dr. Beavis seems indisposed to my receiving immunotherapy
outside a clinical trial, due, I believe, to the prohibitive cost of the drugs (if taken in the
course of a trial, though, they are free); however, I'm pushing her a bit on this, as she
told me that occasionally she's been able to obtain the meds for a reasonable cost
outside of a trial. Further, as she told me, immunotherapy has not proven as effective as
originally hoped in treating ovarian cancer (unlike the case for blood cancer, lung
                    
cancer); however, she still feels that it's worthwhile for me to pursue this treatment in
the context of a clinical trial. I posed a series of immunotherapy-focused questions to the
members of a chat group I occasionally consult, Sisterhood of Ovarian Cancer Survivors.
Some corroborated what Dr. Beavis told me, others contradicted it. I also read conflicting
categorizations of Avastin, a drug I will continue taking as of this Friday. While some said
it was an immunotherapy drug (and indeed, I've seen it described this way online),
others rather vehemently denied this (Steve, care to weigh in?). So consulting this
'sisterhood' only turned out to be moderately helpful, in the end, but I gleaned a few
useful pieces of information.
In any event, my appointment at M.D. Anderson is on W Oct. 26th with Dr. Shannon
Westin, whom I've heard good reports about. I *might* change the appointment to a
slightly later date, as a 10/26 meeting leaves me scant time to make plans, figure out
logistics etc. Having the wherewithal and stamina to navigate large airports and a
sprawling, unfamiliar medical center given my current health challenges makes me
somewhat anxious but if need be I'm sure I could do it, perhaps w/a bit of help in the
airports. Road (i.e. air) trip to Houston, anyone?
I have a bit more 'homework' to do looking into what other cancer and/or medical
centers (Dana-Farber, NYU Langone, Penn, Mayo) might have to offer.
In one tiny piece of good news for this week, because my magnesium level crept back
into normal range per my labwork, my two-hour infusion on Monday was cancelled! This
means that, after brunch with a friend, I'll have the rest of the afternoon to spend with
Ben, who's coming for a week-long visit this afternoon and who has off for Columbus
Day! It's the little things...
I also had to have an echocardiogram this week, ordered by Dr. Beavis, who seemed
concerned by my occasional shortness of breath (from the results I received for this
sonogram of my heart, it appears that everything's normal, but I'll wait to hear it from
Dr. B. next week). Because no appointments were available in State College, I was
booked at a Geisinger clinic in Philippsburg, half an hour northwest of State College. The
fall foliage and bursts of sunshine on a largely cloudy day were dazzling as I drove to my
destination. Less dazzling were the many, many signs in rural Warren county (waaay
deep into Maga-country) instructing to 'drain the swamp' and to vote for Mastriano (who
threatens to charge women who have abortions with murder) as governor and Oz as
senator.
The Geisinger facility was pretty run-down, but convenient enough for a non-invasive
procedure. As the technician rolled a wand over, poked and prodded the left side of my
chest, I semi-snoozed, only to awake with a start when I heard her say to me: ""You have
a little, tiny breast"" (!!). When I looked at her with some alarm and shock, she repeated
what she had actually said the first time: ""Let's have a little, tiny breath."" I told her what
                    
I thought she had said and we both had a hearty belly-laugh.
Since I have not had chemo in over a month (Sept. 2 was my last infusion, I believe), I
am actually feeling pretty well w/the drugs out of my system (I felt strong enough to fast
on Yom Kippur). Four weeks is usually the length of the 'wash' between treatments, so
I'm a bit past that. I'm eager to restart treatment, but certainly wish my body could have
taken a longer break from chemo, as I've had so much of it. Dr. Beavis indicated that my
neuropathy is likely to get worse and there is a litany of scary potential side effects with
Avastin. I do hope a clinical trial will be a next step.
Looking at my date book, I see lots of medical appointments this past week, but I did
manage to get out for a long drive (I'm determined to spend as much time outdoors as
possible in October, just as I had a similar goal in May/June - some of these days, colors,
smells, tastes are too beautiful to miss out on!). I enjoyed a fun outing last night with my
friends Mar and Maria to a newish brewery/restaurant, Titan Hollow. The place is
enormous, large enough to accommodate the dinner-theatre production in which Mar's
wife Jessi had a large part. The play was a 'whodunnit' murder mystery with many
interactive twists, and great fun. The locally brewed hard cider was also delish!

316,"Just a short post to share that I tested positive for Covid yesterday morning. A friend had
contacted me Saturday, I believe, to let me know that she had tested positive after our
break fast at the synagogue last Wednesday. To the best of my knowledge, at least five
people came out of Yom Kippur services with Covid. I had tested myself Friday and
Sunday and was negative, went out both days and felt ok (except for a very slight dry
cough), then Sunday night started to decline. Felt horrendous this morning -- splitting
headache, cough, fatigue (have been resting all day), some chills, nausea. This evening I
feel no worse, the chills seem to have dissipated, the headache is now low-grade, and I
was even able to eat a bit of dinner, thanks to Michael and Sue's generosity in grilling a
ribeye. I'm hoping that my compromised immune system can rally and fight this thing
off. I think we were all a bit traumatized by the horror stories from the early days of
Covid. Unfortunately, I've not had my third booster yet, as it's scheduled for about a
week from now.
Ben, here for a week I had hoped would be full of fun activities (foliage drives, movies
etc.) is an incredibly caring, competent, calm soul. I am terribly disappointed that he
once again needs to help me out (and of course am concerned about him getting Covid
too), but we're still looking forward to watching the Yankees in the playoffs tomorrow
night (though probably in different rooms!).
My doctor did not yet phone in a prescription for me for Paxlovid today, despite my
multiple calls and portal messages to his office, including at least one that was 'fast
tracked' to him. Grrr... Frustrating and stressful. Will resume my efforts tomorrow, not
easy in my current state.
I am so touched by recent calls, texts and emails from friends. I'm unable to write now
(I'm even amazed I could write this short blog post!) but I will, as soon as I feel better. I
haven't forgotten, on the contrary.",2,fear,0.7504144,0.013839956,0.09251804,0.7504144,0.004224227,0.024755808,0.06703617,0.047211464
317,"....or, ""what a shitty week!,"" as one of my friends aptly put it. Like clockwork, poor Ben
came down with Covid Thursday night, exhibiting the same symptoms I experienced:
chills, cough, congestion, fatigue + fever. Since he's not taking an antiviral med as I am,
                    
his symptoms might actually be worse than mine. He's definitely not feeling well, but as
he's young and strong and heathy, he's pushing through, taking regular walks around
the neighborhood and helping me out immensely around the house. We're drinking tea
(and water and apple cider), sucking on cough drops, ingesting Ibuprofen, cooling down
with popsicles, rooting on the Yankees (yesterday's game a disappointment...) and trying
to get through this. Despite the general yuckiness of the past seven days, when we lit
Shabbat candles and talked about what we were grateful for this week, we agreed that
being together and bringing comfort (and gallows humor) to one another had been a
boon, and that we certainly could have had it worse. 
I tested positive again this morning, no surprise. I'm improving, but quite incrementally
at this point. I'm still congested and fatigued, and need energy to deal with my cancer.
Covid has downstream effects on my cancer treatment. My chemo has to be put off for
two weeks on top of the many weeks I've already gone without any treatment as we
weighed the various next best options (clinical trials, chemo etc.). My consult at M.D.
Anderson, in turn, has also been moved to a later date. Oh well. Must bend with the
bamboo. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that my immune system has been so
successful so far in fighting Covid.
Michael and Sue generously provided us with two delicious dinners this week, as I don't
have much 'oomph' for cooking (although I'll try to make some red lentil soup with lemon
later). Thanks to local friends who have been checking in and also offering help (you
know who you are!) -- I am *very grateful* for your help and kindness!
It's a gorgeous day and I'm going to try to take a drive (or perhaps two drives, one with
Ben after the big PSU-Michigan game) today. Must let the fall foliage bedazzle me!",5,sadness,0.45433918,0.03576032,0.044945933,0.29016137,0.023630388,0.059317518,0.45433918,0.09184526
318,"Health update: ""A Series of Unfortunate Events,"" as never encountered by the Baudelaire
children...
Thankfully, both Ben and I are over Covid. Well, that was one heck of an unpleasant two-
week detour. Geez, Louise... I finally tested negative yesterday, after the virus had
progressed from something flu-like (cough, congestion, aches and pains, chills, fatigue)
through a bad head cold to the lingering slight congestion I'm experiencing now. Ben's
trajectory was a bit different, and thankfully shorter: flu-like symptoms with persistent
sore throat and loss of taste and smell, which have not yet returned. I was overjoyed to
see the spring in his step once again (he managed to power through full work days,
except for one or two afternoons he took off so he could rest), and he's now back in New
York. Sharing Covid purgatory was actually a blessing and new variant of 'mother-son
bonding' (I guess...); Ben and I both tend to be fairly 'up' people by nature so we kept
                    
one another afloat, peppering our conversations with plenty of gallows humor... We
cooked healthy meals and watched the Yankees-Guardians series (yay!) and then the
Yankees-Astros series (ugh, but fourth-generation Yankees fan Ben, whose grandfather
climbed onto the roof of Joe DiMaggio's car back in the day to snap his picture in the
driver's seat, was invited to Game 4 tonight!). It was unfortunate that Ben couldn't spend
more time with his dad, but we didn't want to risk Michael and Sue being exposed.
Michael was in touch with Ben several times daily and was also checking up on me. I
should mention, too, that throughout my two or so years of dodging Covid and being
shielded from it in the hospital when I had surgeries in 2020 and 2022, I always imagined
that, should I contract the virus, it would be difficult (and potentially dangerous) to shake
b/c of my fragile immune system. So the fact that, in the end, Covid did not appear to hit
me harder than it did others I know who have had it, reassured me.
Yet Covid is tricky for cancer patients. My treatment has been delayed by two weeks to
allow for full recovery. I'm slated to start a new line of chemo on Tuesday (blood work
tomorrow). Before that, though, I had a four-week 'washout' period between lines of
chemo. And I'm certain that there were at least two other weeks in there when I was
exploring different options, acting like I had all the time in the world to forestall
treatment! I don't even want to look at my calendar to see when I had my last treatment
but I think early September.  I never imagined I'd be hit with Covid at this critical
juncture... In the past few days I think I've begun to feel a bit 'symptomatic' - but maybe
that's a result of my anxiety? Discomfort under my right rib cage and in my upper-
abdominal area, where an enlarged lymph node sits. Is this what it feels like to stop
treatment? Has my cancer progressed significantly while I've awaited chemo?
And the treatment I'm about to receive (Avastin + Doxil) constitutes the *least* desirable
of the three options Dr. Beavis had laid out for me.  The result with each line of chemo I
have received has been a net progression of the disease, but perhaps this new combo
will help a bit. I'm not optimistic, though. Only about two days ago, I received definitive
word from Hopkins that no slot would be available for me at this time in the Phase I
clinical trial Dr. Beavis had signaled to me. Phase I trials are the riskiest (v. Phase II and
III) as their goal is primarily to establish correct dosage levels of certain medications or
medication combos, relying on volunteers such as myself. However, the interesting thing
about this trial for me is that one of the drugs used targets a specific mutation my tumor
exhibits.  Apparently, the trial sponsor (ie pharma company) has been jerking Hopkins
around, telling Hopkins both that they want more slots opened for the trial *and* that
they need more time to evaluate [something?]). So now I am mad at a nameless,
faceless Big Pharma company too, for delaying my access to potentially life-prolonging
treatment. I'll be on the waiting list for access to the trial; perhaps after completing my
next line of chemo, followed by a scan and washout period, I'll be eligible, *if* the timing
works out (and that's a big 'if').
I do plan to travel to Houston in mid-November for an appointment with Dr. Shannon
                    
Westin, a gyn-onc with an excellent reputation. MDA is running clinical trials that Dr.
Beavis concurs look interesting for me, several involving immunotherapy. Yes, Houston is
far, but I need to find out for myself what would be involved should I have the
opportunity of gaining access to a trial there.  People travel there from all over the world,
as they do to all major medical centers. And my college friend/guardian angel Steve
Sherman is an oncologist at MDA, has offered to help me out if needed, and knows Dr.
Westin!
I went to look at plots at Centre County Memorial Park a few days ago. Dying is
expensive! Yeesh...  Cemeteries/funeral homes really nail you, but I guess they figure
they have a 'captive audience...' I simply wanted to take care of this so my family will
have less to figure out - whenever the time comes.  My acute natural curiosity leads me
to be quite fascinated by rituals surrounding death, burial etc., so the cemetery visit was
simply 'interesting' (certainly not scary or traumatizing) and the site serene and beautiful
on a sunny autumn day. What I've decided so far is that I'd like to be buried in the
'liberal' quadrant of the Jewish section (where interfaith couples can be buried, where
cremated remains can be buried etc.). It was poignant and comforting to find 'friends'
there -- a couple that joined a PSU alumni tour to France that I led shortly after arriving
at Penn State; the son of lovely friends in my congregation, who died in his early forties
from cancer... I had been leaning towards cremation, but now I'm contemplating the
more traditional Jewish burial in a plain pine box. Holes are drilled into the concrete vault
in which the casket is placed, essentially letting the casket and human remains
biodegrade and return to the earth. I have explored a bit what a 'green burial' entails as
that would be my preference, but the practice is still not widespread and the resources
seemingly unavailable in central PA. 
Yesterday my friend Bénédicte called me soon after I rolled out of bed and suggested we
might hit an auction in Centre Hall; we had talked about our love of auctions and
antiquing and she had introduced me to the site auctionzip.com, which contains listings
of auctions by zip code. A gorgeous fall day; a farm on a central PA backroad; a crowd of
dealers, curiosity seekers, Amish families, locals; a talented auctioneer with a
mesmerizing patter; assorted tools, vintage toys, stoneware crocks, furniture, even the
farm itself + its 33 acres -- all made for a delightful post-Covid outing!

320,"Health update: Something feels 'amiss' in my upper abdomen. Discomfort under my right
rib cage, in my stomach area (liver? cancerous lymph node near my stomach?
intestines?). Feels uncomfortable when I bend over or compress that area in any way.
Not much appetite. Some nausea from time to time, but not chronically. Fatigue. No
acute pain, though. Taking Tylenol, antacids, nausea med. Wonder if the new chemo
combo might be disagreeing with me more than others. Wonder if that long hiatus from
treatment might have affected me adversely. Wonder if it's nothing to worry about.
Wonder, wonder, wonder. Yesterday's routine CT-scan (pelvis, abdomen, chest) was
therefore well-timed (although long and boring, with about two hours spent in my car
                    
drinking at intervals the icky pre-scan barium concoction); I've written Drs. Patel and
Beavis to see if they can review the scans themselves and let me know if they see
anything that needs to be attended to. I'm slated to go to NY this weekend, and really
want to, as early as Thursday. I hope I might have some clarity tomorrow, either from my
oncologists or the radiologists reading the images.
I have bought my plane ticket to Houston (actually bought it w/miles accrued on my
credit card), for mid-November. I'll consult about clinical trials that might be appropriate
for me and related treatment issues with Dr. Shannon Westin, a gyn-onc who comes
highly recommended. I will also assess the feasibility for me of treatment in Houston
(cost, time, energy, potential winter travel); people travel to M.D. Anderson, as to other
major medical centers, from all over the world, but will that scenario work for me (my
hunch is that if it has a good chance of prolonging my life, then yes)? Ben will kindly
meet me in Houston after my appointment; we'll spend the night there, then drive the
next day to Austin, where my friend and long-ago PSU colleague Jim Davis is lending me
his condo (thanks, Jim!) in this groovy food and music mecca, a liberal enclave in red
Texas. I've been twice to Austin but a long time ago. I'm trusting Jim to take us to his
favorite Mexican and/or bbq joints. I'm always delighted to spend a weekend with my
best travel buddy. And I'm grateful/relieved that a small but solid support network is
emerging for me in Houston, consisting of my college friend Steve Sherman, himself an
oncologist at M.D. Anderson; my grad school colleague, Julie Fette, whom my friend
Denis Provencher let know, over breakfast in Montreal, that I was coming to Houston
(Julie teaches at Rice; thanks, Denis!); and my cousin Dina, who now lives in Houston
with her family (Ilene, please thank Dina again for me; thanks too, aunt Marlene!). Both
Julie and Dina have offered help in whatever form I need. There are angels everywhere.
Fortunately, chemo day only comes around every other week, but it's a rough go this
time.
I really haven't done much this past week as I was feeling a bit off my game and also
kicking out the remnants of Covid (good riddance...). I managed a visit from a friend and
a lunch out. A lovely hydrangea-covered card from Clare, spending the year in Europe,
lifted my spirits as did thoughtful 'self-care' gifts from Melissa, and kind texts and emails.
I've gotten out for some drives as I had vowed to absorb the magnificent October
weather. I hardly remember the fall colors ever being so vibrant: pierced through with
sunlight, the leaves seemed to have a sheen. The orange leaves were literally the color
of oranges! Some leaves called out to me 'burnt sienna' or 'burnt umber,' in homage to
two of the Crayola crayons I loved as a kid. And others, actually needles from some type
of fir tree, had turned a deep, velvety crimson like the ribbons on potted poinsettia
plants, a Christmas color. Breathtaking panoramas of color framing the farms and
villages of central PA.
                    
Be well, everyone.
P.S. I just finished a France and the Holocaust-themed book that held my attention
throughout, _La Carte postale,_ by Anne Berest. I do recommend it (I believe the English
translation is out now>_The Postcard_).

having abdominal discomfort and increasingly bad headaches. A CT-scan of my brain
revealed some new cancerous spots and some bleeding (apparently not requiring any
immediate surgical intervention) -- not totally unexpected but yet somewhat surprising.
As the day progressed my head felt like it was splitting and I was very nauseous and was
vomiting. I'm having an MRI today (my friend Greg Fox, Maria's husband, is driving me to
a center further even than Lewistown so they can fit me in). Meanwhile, I hope my
medical team is working on a plan, as I really don't know much right now. I owe several
emails, texts and phone calls (Martina, Kathryn, Steve et al.) and I apologize sincerely for
not having the bandwidth to be able to answer them right now; thank you all for your
kindness. I also want to thank Maria for staying over last night and taking care of me! If

322,"Just another quick update: I am sorry if I worried anyone yesterday with my news. Yes, it
is unwelcome, but I also tend to become very anxious when I receive such news of
developments in my condition (although not unexpected), and I imagine I was projecting
                    
some of that -- or perhaps the news itself was simply scary. But it's not dire. My MRI
yesterday went smoothly. Dr. Patel called me this morning to discuss that scan and
confirmed that there are two tiny (mm) spots on my left and right frontal lobes and a few
other spots here and there. He wasn't seeing much bleeding to speak of but he took me
off my blood thinner. I also now have an appointment with my radiologist next week,
most likely to discuss radiating the spots (no surgery will happen). Dr. Patel confirmed
that the spots can return (also not unexpected); that sneaky, dastardly cancer found
some new pathways into my brain. Cancer has also made inroads into my upper
abdominal area (where I was having acute discomfort, sending me to the emergency
room). Armed with Tylenol (every four hours) and Oxycodone (as needed; I don't take it
much), I'm succeeding in getting my symptoms under control. No more splitting
headaches, but I can actually feel the cancerous spots causing me some discomfort at
the front of my head. But I am not at death's door. I am not The Dying Girl and don't
want to  be cast (or cast myself) in that role (is it obvious to restate that finitude is a
reality for all of us?).
I am feeling more emotionally even keel today. I took care of a whole bunch of emails
and texts, esp. with my doctors, then took a nice long drive, which is what I do to clear
my head. Stopped by the antique store and bought an Art Deco-looking vase for.... 84
cents! The fall colors have peaked but they are not completely gone. I'm extremely sorry
not to be in NY this weekend, but feel I made the right decision to stay put. This means I
can see a few friends here, within close range.
I look forward to a good chat with Rabbi Ostrich on Sunday.
No pity party (as my cousin and I always tell each other). I am glad to be alive and
abundantly blessed!

323,"After the hell of last week -- splitting headaches, nausea, vomiting bile, loss of appetite,
acute abdominal discomfort, day in the ER, discovery of new brain mets and of slight
progression of cancer in abdomen, multiple scans and MRI (over the hills Greg Fox and I
went to a rather forlorn Geisinger outpost in Mifflintown, 30 miles from State College),
anxiety-fueled certainty that my death was imminent, lots of unpleasant 'déjà vu all over
again' moments -- on the heels of the hell of the previous weeks (Covid!) -- I am back on
my horse, feeling a good bit better (yet far from perfect) now that I have gotten
symptoms under control with Tylenol every four hours, smaller meal portions, and a
blander diet than normal. Emotionally, I'm on a much more even keel this week.
To recap 'this week in cancer:' Monday: labs (counts a bit out of whack because of what
my body had endured the week before; magnesium count very low); Tuesday: chemo
(Avastin) + magnesium drip. Dr. Patel advises I maintain my current chemo regimen
unless my team decides otherwise. No major side effects from the chemo, just some
fatigue that didn't preclude my running errands, taking drives etc.; Wednesday: early
dentist appointment to repair a chipped front tooth (I was tired from having stayed up
late the night before watching the election returns, yet elated as I had glanced at my
phone at 4 a.m. and had seen that John Fetterman had won the Senate election! and
that our state house had gone blue for the first time in eleven years, which is huge).
On Thursday I met with Dr. Patel (jeune), the radiologist I had worked with after my brain
surgery in January. We 'vibed' better this time; on our first go-around I had found him
somewhat defensive and edgy. He seemed kinder on Thursday, and empathic, and
unrushed. I will receive three fairly high-dose stereotactic radiation treatments,
pinpointing the two cancerous spots that he clearly detects in my brain. There may be
other small cancerous areas but as they are too small (I presume) to be clearly identified
as such, he will hold off on radiating them until next time. Now that those dastardly
cancer cells have found a way into my brain, I presume (and he implied) that they may
return (when? how many? how often? a sobering prospect). The goal, he said, will be to
avoid whole brain radiation, with its attendant risks of Scary Things happening to the
brain (e.g. memory and cognitive impairment). So some decisions will need to be made
at that point. Personally, these may simply not be acceptable risks for me. My brain's my
thing and thankfully for the moment it's still pretty darn sharp. I'll start the treatments
after Thanksgiving. But this coming Monday I'll undergo yet another CT-scan of my brain
and get fitted for my mask (that gruesome Life of Brian meets Silence of the Lambs
contraption that I was buckled into and then buckled onto the radiation table with in
February). Three months later, barring any untoward developments, I'll have a scan to
see whether we've held the cancer at bay. So, again a bit of a reprieve for now.
The 'bleeding in my brain' refers simply to some tiny amounts of blood pooling inside the
new lesions. I do not have a brain bleed. No surgical intervention is necessary.
                    
A pleasant antidote to thinking about all the medical stuff was dinner last night with my
friend Deb at Creekside at the Gamble Mill, a newly-renovated restaurant in what once
was an 1894 mill. It was lots of fun to catch up and check out a new restaurant. So many
people kindly tell me I look wonderful -- a point I do concede for the most part (does that
sound arrogant?). I do not at present look like scary Cancer Girl. I just wish I felt as good
as I look.
Now that all the pieces have fallen into place -- I'm cleared for travel, know that a
consultation is still a possibility etc. - I am headed to TX next week! Unfortunately,
because of the new brain lesions, clinical trials are currently off the table for me. This
took quite a bit of wind out of my sails. Was it going to be worthwhile even to make the
trip, given the fact that M.D. Anderson currently has nothing to offer me (as far as I can
tell)? Nevertheless, I decided that it would be worth it to speak with Dr. Shannon Westin,
a gyn-onc with an excellent reputation, see what might be available *down the line* if I
can ward off a recurrence of new brain mets for at least 6 months-1 year, get on the gyn-
onc team's radar screen, glean information about promising new treatments, have any
preliminary tests needed (e.g. blood work) etc. My college classmate/oncologist at M.D.
Anderson/guardian angel Steve Sherman has also smoothed my path at MDA and I hope
to have dinner with him and his wife there. The trip will also offer an opportunity for Ben
and me to have an adventure as we like'em: he'll meet me Wednesday night in Houston,
having flown from NY (I reserved rooms in a swanky looking new Intercontinental near
MDA because ""Why not?""). He'll work remotely on Thursday, following which we'll drive
to Austin for the weekend; I've visited this capital city twice but not for a long time. My
former colleague and friend Jim is nicely lending us his condo and I look forward to
seeing him and meeting his husband, Danny. I have a few items on my Austin wish list --
I'd love to check out a great Western wear shop and a two-step dancing hall and some of
the 'weird' that 'keeps Austin weird' - but I'm flexible and await suggestions. If any of
*you* have Austin favorites - best taqueria? Tex-Mex joint? Q? Shop? Bar?
Neighborhoods? Other hot takes? - please let me know!
And then it will be back here for two days before heading to NY for the holiday -- barring
any unforeseen health hiccups, which I can never predict of course.
I also have made an appointment to meet with Dr. Beavis at Hopkins on Dec. 8th. It's
been a long time since I've seen her in person, and I want to make extra sure our close
connection doesn't dissipate. It's so hard to juggle this many doctors and make so many
important decisions.

324,"Back c. 10:30 p.m. last night from my Texas adventure. Exhausted on my return after
awaking early yesterday; driving three hours from Austin to Houston's IAH airport; flying
from Houston to Philly; laying over several hours in Philly; flying from Philly to State
College; and finally, driving home. Somehow, though, I managed to power through
(willapower?). Air-travel induced headaches/head pressure caused by the new cancer did
not materialize, thankfully, and I tried to move my legs as frequently as possible to avoid
clots (I think I'm ok on that front too). In short, I squeaked through although the travel
proved somewhat stress-inducing.
Enjoyed a delicious burger topped w/fried poblano pepper, cheese, bacon and
caramelized onions *plus* a margarita in the hotel lobby and chilled out from the trip.
Noted a visible police and security presence milling about the lobby. Turns out the
President of Panama was in residence.
Health update: On the whole, I felt pretty well during the entire trip, but was definitely
making an effort to 'rise to the occasion' for the reunions with friends and adventure with
Ben. My stomach did not always take well to some of the delicious (yet sometimes spicy,
sometimes heavy) tacos, Tex-Mex, and barbecue I was intent on sampling (Ben too!), but
find that reducing my portion size by about half usually helps me avoid an achy stomach
and nausea.
Somehow on the trip down to Houston a brewing UTI hit me full-force. Most thankfully,
the gyn-onc staff at MDA took a urine sample and then prescribed an antibiotic, without
which it would have been a painful and worrisome trip. Whew. In fact, there were a few
initial hiccups that made me hope they weren't omens for the remainder of the trip: Avis
had rented all its sedans, so Ben wound up with a ....pick-up truck. Very Texas, to be
sure, but the thing was really unwieldy to drive, not to mention park. My (cowboy) hat is
tipped to Ben, though, for keeping his cool as he always does. By the end of the week,
he was driving that behemoth like a champ. Understandably, Ben was not in a great
mood on his arrival -- flight delayed, a mountain of work to confront, a full work day
behind him, the car rental snafu -- but there too, the week only improved.
My consultation at MDA went as I had hoped and expected. Dr. Shannon Westin, a highly
knowledgeable, skilled, compassionate gyn-onc about Dr.  Beavis' age -- filled me in on
some of the clinical trials involving targeted therapies currently being conducted at MDA.
She scooted her chair very close to mine as she explained things to me. One trial
involves removing immune cells from the patient, 'ramping them up' so as to better fight
the ovarian cancer, then reintroducing them into the patient's body. Another involves
removing, then reinserting, a small piece of the patient's tumor, again doing something
to it [didn't quite grasp what] to enable the body to fight the o.c. more effectively. She
described how some treatments involve 'putting on the brakes' and others involve
                    
'taking the brakes off' (the immune system, for example). MDA  definitely sets the gold
standard for many of the most innovative clinical trials and treatments these days.
But of course - as I knew - I am not eligible now for a clinical trial as my brain cancer has
recurred. Why is this? The clearest answer I've been able to get is that the medical
facility conducting the trial (or perhaps the drug company sponsoring it, or both) wants
to compare 'apples to apples,' ie select for the trial patients with ovarian cancer *only*
(and sometimes with a particular tumor type or genetic marker). There are often other
restrictions, too, as I experienced at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Otherwise, I presume, the
secondary cancer might interfere with, cause delays in, or react adversely to the
experimental treatment. *However,* Dr. Westin said there is pushback (from the FDA,
physicians and others) against the stipulation that brain mets preclude participation in a
clinical trial. When might this policy be changed? Likely not in my lifetime. Grrr.
Dr. Westin did allude to the fact, though, that there *are* a few trials allowing patients
with brain mets to participate in them. Must follow up on that tantalizing piece of info
with Dr. Beavis.
Echoing what I've heard from other sources, Dr. Westin confirmed that the jury is still out
on whether immunotherapy is an effective treatment for o.c. She did mention two chemo
drugs, however, that I had not heard of and with which I have not yet been treated. I will
also discuss this with Dr. Beavis when I head to Baltimore in early December for an
appointment. Dr. Beavis also mentioned seeing whether Hopkins might have something
to offer me right now. The problem is that I've had an awful lot of chemo, and still my
disease progresses. I was really hoping for a clinical trial but bad timing with the brain
mets; I'll receive three high-dose treatments of radiation after Thanksgiving.
I am grateful to Dr. Westin and her team, though, for conveying a hopeful message:
""There are options."" And regret neither this ""information gathering mission"" nor the
opportunity to get on MDA's radar screen as a potential patient (ie I'm 'in their system'
now). If the planets aligned for me to receive treatment there (I'd need to be free of
brain mets for six months [or was it a year?], and I just don't think that's going to
happen), I'd have to think hard about the feasibility of this prospect, logistically. It's a
total schlep (more like an odyssey) to get there and back, and that fact alone (aside from
expense etc.) gives me pause. But I'm far from needing to make decisions about that;
when and if the time comes...
I shared some of the day's developments with my dinner companions: my college
classmate Steve Sherman, an endocrinologist at MDA who has been so helpful and kind
towards me since I learned of my diagnosis and contacted him in a panic, and his wife
Janine, a registered nurse working in women's health (a lovely person with whom I very
much enjoyed speaking). Despite the relative brevity of our meeting, Steve struck me
much as he did in college: a thoughtful, intellectually sharp guy with a good sense of
                    
humor. I believe he is my only college classmate who was also a dormmate for four
years, first in Stoughton Hall (we reminisced!), then in Currier House. Steve and Janine
seem to be enjoying a wonderful life of travel (often to Italy), time with their three grown
children (one of whom will soon marry), and successful careers. Happy for them! Dinner
at Café Rabelais in Rice Village, finished off with a profiterole for each of us and
accompanied by a tasty Sancerre, was excellent (respecting my 'small portion = no
stomach distress' rule, I brought a good part of my dinner back to the hotel for Ben).
Both Dr. Westin and Steve and Janine thought I looked 'great.' This has now become
something of a tea-leaf reading exercise for me. On the one hand, Dr. Beavis has
maintained that one can 'look great' yet still be quite ill (I remember meeting a
physically beautiful friend of Michael's a long time ago; she had melanoma and died
several months after we stayed with her and her husband in their apartment in
Bloomington, IN). On the other, Steve and Janine suggested that 'looking great' might
manifest a strong, life-affirming spirit, which in turn *might* affect prospects for survival.
Hard to know, yet I try to decode whatever signs present themselves to me, likely with a
good dose of projection involved.  And I am appreciative of the compliments!
Will write about our fun weekend in Austin in my next entry (I hope). Tired now -- and
need to turn around and start packing for New York, as tomorrow is a chemo day and I'm
likely to be worn out when I get home.

325,"Some of what I'm grateful for today:
**Fourth* Thanksgiving since my diagnosis;
*I've been given this day, and am feeling, on the whole, alright;
*A dear friend recuperating well from an operation that should eliminate a host of
troublesome, worrisome symptoms;
*Two of my chemo nurses, Brianne and Tracey. After not having seen me at chemo for a
few weeks,  Tracey, this past Tuesday, planted a big, friendly, affectionate kiss on my
cheek. She had been working the polls during my last chemo session; she, Brianne and I
are on the same page politically and socially, although we've needed to keep those
conversations hushed, because you never know what the reaction might be around here.
Both Tracey and Brianne help keep me grounded in the present -- in the day, the
moment -- even as I experience setbacks. They keep me buoyant with their expert care,
concern, and friendship.
*A wonderful reunion in Austin after about thirty years with my former colleague, my
friend Jim Davis. Jim thoughtfully set Ben and me up in his comfy Austin condo, and
arranged an insider's tour of the city with his friend (of a friend), Craig. Grateful for Jim's
kindness, loyalty, interesting life, and sense of humor that keeps me laughing when I'm
with him!
*My ability to make the trip to Houston and Austin last week, even as travel becomes a
bit harder for me;
*A red tsunami averted by the efforts of the millions of patriots who realized that our
democracy was imperiled. A democratic governor, senator and state house in our
Commonwealth!
*My wondrously compassionate and loving son, Ben;
*My family: Ben & Sammi, mom & Arnold, Ethan & Ronit (and her family), Eve, Isaac,
Julie, Aunt Marlene, Michael (and his family), Ruth, Claudia and my many other cousins in
the U.S. and Canada.
*My beloved friends, some of multiple decades, others of more recent date.
If all this gratitude stuff is too much for you, try to catch Amy Schumer's funny parody of
the notion (and practice). Can't find the link, but saw it on Facebook.
My prayers going out today to the friend mentioned above, recovering from surgery;
another friend recovering from surgery; and a dear friend of many decades, currently
undergoing chemotherapy. Who knew, when we were teenagers shopping for clothes at
Bloomingdale's, lunching on burgers after school ended on Fridays, and having
sleepovers, that this would be part of our shared life journey?
So my Thanksgiving  plans imploded this year. About half an hour before I was to leave
to drive to the Lewistown Junction train station yesterday, my brother -- our host and
                    
chef this year - texted me from New York to say he had tested positive, twice, for Covid
and that he was fully symptomatic (awful cough, chills etc.). That meant, of course, that
Thanksgiving as planned was off, and my main concern remains that my brother feel
better and that his family stay healthy. I then called my mother, who had also received
the news, and learned that she too was feeling under the weather (Covid-negative yet
red, scratchy throat) and was discouraging me from staying with her in the city, as
planned. I next called Ben, asking if I could stay in his apartment while he was in
Amherst, MA, with his dad, aunt and uncle, and Berkman cousins. That way, I thought I
could still have lunch with a bunch of my college friends on Friday, as also planned,
spend Sunday with Ben (ditto), and help out my brother or mother if needed. Ben said
he'd leave his keys with the neighbors, so I threw my bags in my car, and headed to
Lewistown without a minute to spare.
En route to Lewistown (about 25 miles from my house), I began to have a change of
heart as I thought about navigating the city on a holiday weekend, taking the subway
into Manhattan from Brooklyn for my appointments, hauling my heavy bags up the steep
staircases of Ben's walkup, buying groceries, perhaps trying to get myself 'adopted' by
one of my friends for Thanksgiving etc. Cause or consequence, a nasty headache started
to come on, compounded by the fatigue from both chemo the previous day and the
recent trip to Texas, from which I had just returned. I pulled off the road an exit or two
before Lewistown, made my final resolution, called Ben, then turned around and headed
back to State College. I was so mentally and physically exhausted that I slept for several
hours.
So it's an odd, somewhat isolating day, but it's ok. I miss not being with my family, just
as I miss our holiday traditions (chocolate turkeys at each table setting) and special
foods (both cooking and eating them). We all texted one another this morning with
holiday greetings. But no pity party. My brother's health is the priority. And I've enjoyed
many memorable Thanksgivings in the past. Cancer has granted me the serenity to
""accept the things I cannot change"" in many different situations. State College friends, I
gave serious thought to contacting some of you who I know are in town to see if you
might set another place at your table for me; I feel confident you would have graciously
said yes. But in the end, I'm opting for a contemplative day, with my Wegman's turkey
dinner and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to enjoy -- for which I am sincerely grateful! I
am around this weekend, though. :)
Here are excerpts from two poems that have resonated with me recently, and especially
on this day, and at this time in my life:
From Ross Gay, ""Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude""
Soon it will be over,
                    
which is precisely what the child in my dream said,
holding my hand, pointing at the roiling sea and the sky
hurtling our way like so many buffalo,
who said it’s much worse than we think,
and sooner; to whom I said
no duh child in my dreams, what do you think
this singing and shuddering is,
what this screaming and reaching and dancing
and crying is, other than loving
what every second goes away? [my emphasis]
Goodbye, I mean to say.
And thank you. Every day.
                    
From Joy Harjo, ""Praise the Rain"" (w/thanks to my friend Sally):
Praise crazy. Praise sad.
Praise the path on which we're led.
Praise the roads on earth and water.
Praise the eater and the eaten.
Praise beginnings; praise the end.
Praise the song and praise the singer.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.",3,joy,0.9027572,0.0039427746,0.0024010423,0.026604468,0.9027572,0.045695785,0.012781951,0.0058167106
326,"In the end, I'm glad I turned around en route to the Lewistown train station, as I've been
enjoying a restful, restorative weekend. I was overwhelmed by the generosity and
thoughtfulness of those who reached out to me immediately on reading about my
derailed plans: Maria called me as soon as she read my post on Thursday to invite me to
join her family for the pies they were about to tuck into; Ben's darling bff from grade
school, Nikhil, dropped by Thursday evening with his mother to hand deliver leftovers
from their Indian-American feast (the best Indian food I've had in a long while!) - let's
hear it for the little boys who used to play basketball together in the Pioneer League
growing into such thoughtful, caring young men!; Sandy delivered to my doorstep an
entire almond-pear tart from The Hummingbird Room (very yummy); Deb and Tony had
me to dinner Friday for delicious Thanksgiving leftovers and interesting conversation;
Monique invited me for dinner last night. I am so humbled. Best.friends.ever. I love the
networks of care that somehow seem to develop easily in smaller communities.
I know many friends were out of town this weekend and never expected such a wave of
kindness.
Meanwhile, my brother, thankfully, is on the mend from Covid, but my sister-in-law just
tested positive...
Health update: I am feeling decent, status quo. I took a long drive in the glorious
sunshine and saw a team of five horses plowing a field; bought some carrots and kale at
a local farm. Tylenol staves off headaches. Keeping my portions small; I have a feeling
that a cancerous lymph node sitting atop my stomach that has increased slightly in size
is also pressing on my stomach. Hoping that Dr. Patel (the younger) will finish up my
treatment plan early next week so I can be scheduled for three radiation treatments next
week and/or the following one, when I will also go to Baltimore for an appointment with
Dr. Beavis. No chemo until next Tuesday. Will meet with my palliative care doc via
videoconference this week; she'll help me fill out my DNR card to affix to my fridge and
discuss other items on my agenda.
A brief report on our weekend in Austin:
Things are *big* in Texas: big hair (did not see any but am assured it's a thing); big belt
buckles and cowboy hats; the biggest plastic travel mugs I've ever seen; big people.
Everyone has guns. Signs at the entrance to many establishments state ""no concealed
weapons.""
""Keep Austin weird,"" I am told, has now yielded, by all evidence, to ""Keep Austin
gentrifying,"" with the old mom and pop shops, music joints, and grunge neighboring
                    
Hermès boutiques and Warby Parker outlets. The one taste I got of Austin's weirdness
during a two-day visit was our stop for lunch at Wright Brothers Brew & Brew, which
offers brews (on tap) and brews (coffee). Young crowd. Baristas with tats, long hair, flesh
tunnels and piercings. Is that really all that weird? It seemed like any number of coffee
shops one might find in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or Boulder.
Music everywhere, every brewery, street corner, two-step dance hall etc. Ditto taco
stands -- in gas stations, food truck courts etc.
Thursday: we arrived from Houston in our pick up truck around 7:30 p.m., stopping on
the way at Buc-ee's, a southern version of Sheetz but with an astounding array of beef
and turkey jerky (which we sampled) and reputedly immaculate bathrooms (an urban
legend?). Headed to a taco truck behind Celis Brewery, Con Todo, that Ben had read
about and brought our food back to Jim's condo: I sampled the spiciest taco I had ever
tasted, full of charred cauliflower, and a tostada with guacamole. Incredibly tasty spices,
yet hard on my stomach. Everywhere we went, the tortillas were handmade, and fresh
and delicious. Love the food truck culture in Austin.
Friday: It was wonderful to see my former colleague Jim and give him a big hug after
about thirty years. I introduced him to Ben, whom he had never met, and he regaled us
with funny stories about how he and his husband, Danny, had come together as a
couple. Jim seems happy in his life in Austin, punctuated by frequent travels, and I'm so
glad for him. He had engaged a friend of a friend of his, Craig, to be our driver and tour
guide for the day. Craig is an actor and acting teacher - and native Texan - who took us
on an 'insider's tour' of the city while Jim and I caught up a bit in between stretches of
sightseeing. It was such a sweet day. We first headed to SoCo (South Congress Ave.), a
popular area w/interesting shops, mid-century modern hotels, bars etc. I loved Allen's, an
iconic Western wear shop, with its dizzying selection of ornate cowboy boots, Stetsons,
and shirts with pearl snaps. The boots looked uncomfortable, but I'm assured that the
leather becomes supple with wear. We stopped for coffee (Joe's), then headed to a food
truck park for yet more tacos (fish, this time), homemade salsas/hot sauces and guac at
Veracruz All Natural Taco, a local chain. After lunch we hit the Texas history museum (on
the UT campus) and saw a fascinating exhibit about _La Belle,_ a French ship
commandeered by Sieur de la Salle on the orders of Louis XIV that hit a sandbar and
sank, but was later excavated along with about 1.8 million objects the French had
brought with them for both trade and settlement. The French incursion into Texas was a
disaster (de la Salle was intent of finding the Mississippi River but was way off in his
calculations), enabling the Spanish to establish a stronghold there. Serves those darn
French imperialists right! Craig also drove us through many attractive neighborhoods
(Arts and Crafts bungalows, mid-century modern houses), past the Texas capitol building
(the Texas flag is the only state flag allowed to fly at the same height as the U.S. flag, a
deal worked out when Texas ceased to be a republic and joined the U.S. in the mid-19th
c.). Around 4 p.m. I started to flag; I had really surprised myself with my stamina and
                    
was relieved to know that I'm able to 'rise to the occasion' when having a great time.
Ben had to work on Friday but we reunited for dinner at Matt's El Rancho, a popular Tex-
Mex place. 'Popular,' in fact, does not convey the pandemonium generated by the
throngs pouring into the restaurant, waiting four deep at the bar, or lining up to add their
names to the lengthy list of those waiting to be seated. We waited about 45 minutes for
a table and were ushered in to one of two gigantic dining rooms. Given the size and the
slightly 'industrial' nature of the place, the food wasn't bad at all. I had a stuffed poblano
with rice, refried beans, and a gravy. Copious portions. I also had a margarita, which
knocked me out; I fell asleep as soon as I returned to Jim's condo!
Saturday was my day to spend with Ben, a fab, laid back travel companion always game
for adventure and good eats. Unfortunately, we awoke to pouring rain and cold temps,
which did not abate all day! We valiantly set out, once again to a Veracruz taco truck, to
get Ben a breakfast taco, and me a fresh drink with fruit and spinach from their juice bar.
Our outdoor plans having been foiled, we headed to the LBJ Presidential Library/Museum
on the UT campus. I had never been to a presidential library, and while its tone was
clearly hagiographic, I came away wondering whether any president today could bring to
fruition a vision of equality and justice like that of the Great Society. As Johnson had
been president when I was roughly 4-8 or nine, ie during my childhood, I appreciated
having that historical context filled in for me, as my memories are hazy (I do remember
RFK's and MLK's assassinations, my parents' opposition to the Vietnam War, and space
exploration, as well as some of the pop culture'realia' on display [troll dolls! 'flower
power' stickers], but sadly the civil rights movement didn't register with me as a young
child). Fascinating. Ben enjoyed it too, especially the hundreds of hours of LBJ phone
calls (w/MLK, for example) available for listening. Our last stop was again Allen's, the
western wear shop, where I bought a cute bandana. We then headed home to rest up
before dinner.
As we were intent on barbecue, we went to a place Craig had recommended, Lamberts.
This place, located in the downtown business district, was slightly upscale, not your
typical Texas bbq smokehouse (which I would have enjoyed too). My baby back ribs -- I
could only eat two or three -- were just slightly overcooked but their sauce was delicious,
sweet and smoky. Excellent crispy coleslaw with cashews, tangy with lime. Biscuits.
House made pickles. Ben had some other form of barbecue (brisket, I believe) and a
tasty local beer on tap.
We left early Sunday morning for the three hour drive to Houston
******'
I've decided to devote December to the pursuit of hygge: homemade soups, comfy
socks, curling up on the sofa in my sunroom with a good book and a cup of tea, hot
                    
chocolate, or mulled cider, old movies, projects around the house, aromatherapy, hot
showers infused with eucalyptus, candles. Come over for some hot chocolate!
But then I start to get the travel bug... New York? Barbados? Turks and Caicos?....

327,"Health update: I started my second course of radiation this week, with two treatments
down, three to go. Exactly like last time (February, I believe), I am bolted down to a table
wearing a very tight-fitting mask that has been molded to my face, while I clamp down
with my teeth on a kind of 'bit.' The area around my nose is clear so I can breathe (!).
Definitely seems like some medieval form of torture, but rather it's analogous in its
curative powers, I suppose, to the 'poison cure' of chemotherapy. Then the neuro-
oncologist and 'The Physicist,' from an adjacent room, beam radiation very precisely
towards the two (I believe) brain spots that they are radiating on this round. Their
precision is based on several sets of imaging that they've gathered both before and
during my session. The treatment takes about 20 minutes. Because it is so
uncomfortable, I just try to relax my body under the warm blanket enveloping me, close
my eyes, and listen to the playlist (they seem to have correctly pegged me for a
1970s/80s gal, hence Stevie Wonder, CCR, and, poignantly this week, Fleetwood Mac.
The technicians are all very kind and reassuring; yesterday they were excited about how
cool my glittery blue eyeshadow looked under the purple light illuminating my head.
No noticeable side effects from the radiation. Some fatigue (I rested afterwards) and low-
grade headaches that cleared up with Tylenol.
I've begun to explore another procedure -- gamma knife treatment -- for my eventual
recurrence. 'Eventual' because Dr. Patel has told me that a recurrence is probable;
currently, he is only zapping two spots (in my right and left front lobe), because he is not
able to visualize the other areas clearly and does not want to radiate anything he's not
convinced is cancer. But there do appear to be other areas that ""may or may not be"" and
if they turn out to ""be,"" they will need to be radiated too. As Dr. Patel remarked: ""We are
trying to save your brain."" I still don't know too much about gamma knife treatment
(David R., I may need to check in w/you on this) but it seems to me that it might be a
more 'advanced' technology, capable of zapping many cancerous brain areas; with
stereotactic radiation, there seems a limit to the number of areas that can be radiated.
Our hospital does not offer gamma ray treatment, but many other (major?) hospitals,
such as Hopkins, UPMC in Pittsburgh, and even our larger Geisinger facility in Danville,
PA, do. So I contacted Christie, the nurse working with Dr. Bettegowda, the fabulous
neurosurgeon who removed my brain tumor in January, to see if she could help. To my
great relief, she expressed eagerness to help, suggesting that I might need to have a
consult with a radiation oncologist at Hopkins but indicating that Dr. Bettegowda would
also look at my most recent MRI results and provide feedback. I'm waiting to hear back
from her.
I'm  now feeling that my brain, in the end, might become the real problem area,
overshadowing even my o.c. And if/when it comes to full brain radiation, with a much
higher risk of side effects, there will be choices to make.
                    
Throughout all of this, though, I don't feel too bad - at least not this week. I was able to
get out and about, take care of things, attend a play on campus, work on a project
(assembling my Caring Bridge site into 'book' form -- now close to 700 pages!). Not
sleeping great, but am told it may because of the steroid I'm taking before my radiation
treatments.
Will have radiation next Monday, Tuesday, Friday. Tuesday will bring a 'triple whammy'
with radiation early, then an appointment with Dr. Patel (the elder), then chemo (the
'double whammy' with infusions of both drugs, Avastin and Doxil). I'm sure I'll be wiped
by the end of the day, or maybe I'll just snooze during chemo.
Next week I'll also travel to Hopkins for an appointment I made with Dr. Beavis. I haven't
seen her except on a computer screen in a very long time. I want to have a frank
discussion with her about where things stand and gather her thoughts on the best
treatment plan for me going forward, given the many moving parts involved: recurrence
of brain mets, trip to MDA and input from Dr. Westin, availability of treatments at
Hopkins (???) taking into account that my brain mets now appear to preclude
participation in a clinical trial, progression of disease. I am sure that she'll want to
examine me and feel confident that she will suggest the very best plan possible at this
stage. I look forward to seeing her.
I was so touched that David M., my dear college friend who lives in Baltimore and who
has often been one of my 'carers' at Hopkins (sitting with me during infusions, visiting
me after a surgery, driving me to appointments), offered, this time, to drive me at least
one way between Baltimore and State College, about a 3.5 hour trip! So kind of him; I
had planned to drive myself, but then thought twice on realizing that the day before my
drive would be rough for me (chemo *and* radiation). So David will drive me home from
Baltimore to State College, then likely stay over here Thursday night and depart Friday,
refreshed. His husband, Peter, who runs a successful catering business, is in overdrive
for the holiday season and likely won't be able to join us. My equally dear friend Sandy
took me up on my request to drive me to Baltimore on Wednesday, as she has before
(Sandy also drove me to Newark when I went to Paris in May). What a friend! I selfishly
look forward to some 'alone time' with Sandy and David so I can catch up with them in
the car. The rides certainly make my life much easier. I could have driven myself, but it
really tires me out.
This week I found myself veering from my usual stance of gratitude to
discouragement/depression, and back. I'm particularly discouraged about the recurrence
of my brain mets an the prospect of another recurrence, necessitating further treatment.
I need further clarity about my situation -- options, prospects. I find myself hoping to
make it until my birthday, Ben's birthday, Passover, spring... Perhaps what I can best
muster this week is the muted praise Leonard Cohen deems the ""broken hallelujah.""
                    
I wonder whether my friends/readers realized what a marathon my cancer journey would
be. Even to me, it seems a bit old. Whereas the first few years, admittedly, brought some
notes of 'adventure' -- every procedure, every chemo session, every surgery was new
and needed to be analyzed in detail -- now my chemo and radiation sessions, bloodwork,
doctors' visits etc., seem routine, simply woven into the fabric of my life. I am not
complaining about this! It's simply a shift in perspective, a view from the long haul.
I teleconferenced with my palliative care doctor, Dr. Vithalani, this week. She helped me
fill out a DNR order to post on my fridge. She reminded me how important it is for me to
take good care of myself these days, and to not pressure myself -- good advice. Also felt
well cared for by my therapist, another important member of my support team.
I hope I won't be abandoned.
I am grateful this week for coffee this morning with a former student I hadn't seen in
twenty years and who is now a professor (of photojournalism) herself. Was gratified that
a course she took with me on human rights has stayed with her. Although the production
of _Rent_ that I saw on campus on Wednesday with my friend Maria had some flaws, I
very much enjoyed it for both its 'message' (""No day but today"") and the strong
memories it stirred up in me about the early days of the AIDS crisis in New York, where I
was living at the time. Looking forward to Thai dinner w/my friend Jessica tonight.
p.s. I meant to add: Your comments are so affirming and meaningful to me. A wonderful
chorus. I'm sorry I don't respond to each one; I'd like to. As you can imagine, it takes me
a long time to write each entry (a labor of love). I try to respond to a few comments each
time, but please don't consider my 'non-response' as a sign of neglect. All your comment
are included in my 'book!' xo",4,neutral,0.38128617,0.03377606,0.2509428,0.25644165,0.004856848,0.38128617,0.039360523,0.033335976
328,"On Thursday Dr. Beavis told me much more directly than she ever has that she feels we
are nearing the end of viable treatment options for my cancer. She shared this as the
physician who, in her words, looks at the ""big picture."" She was seconded by another
physician (one of her fellows) and a palliative care nurse also in the small exam room
with me, creating a kind of echo chamber. Best case scenario, she said, we'll be sitting in
the same exam room at Hopkins a year from now, just before Chanukah. Or I might die
sooner. Not entirely unexpected, but the prediction of the shortened time  horizon (which
I have now fetishized) functioned, in the moment, like a gut punch.
Any reason to nuance this prediction? Well, I have not yet had a CT-scan since I began
treatment with Doxil and Avastin. This will come fairly soon, and we'll see whether the
cancer has progressed. After this line of chemo, there is one more that Dr. Beavis
recommends trying, with a drug called Pemetrexid (Alimta). We know that with each
successive line, the effectiveness of chemotherapy lessens; the sneaky cancer cells
figure out ways to elude the ""poison cure."" And I've had many lines of chemo, which of
course are killing healthy cells too. So we're seemingly at a point of diminishing returns.
Further: what if, against all odds, I'm able to stave off additional brain mets for about a
year, thus potentially opening up the possibility of my participating in a promising clinical
trial? Yes, I suppose this would be possible, but unlikely. I have discussed with Dr. Patel,
the radiation oncologist, the likelihood of a recurrence and he has even said, in reference
to potentially cancerous spots in my brain that he's not able to visualize perfectly now,
""I'll get those next time."" When I finished my radiation treatments this past Friday, he
said: ""I'm going to be honest with you. Your situation is serious. We're really going to
need to assess the next MRI [in three months] closely to figure out what the options are
at that point."" Of course, even if I began treatment in a trial and developed brain mets in
the course of it, I'd have to leave the trial. Also of course, in the six months-year that it
would take, hypothetically, for me to be rid of brain mets, another problem could arise: a
mass in a lymph node close to my stomach, for example, occasionally causes serious
abdominal distress and a blockage is always a risk.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot: what about a miracle? When she drives me to chemo every
other week, my kind, churchgoing neighbor Janis (who's at odds with her congregation
because she votes Democrat!), always ends with: ""I'm praying for a miracle."" Then we
both laugh, because she knows I don't like her saying that but she, apparently, can't help
herself. I simply say to her: ""You need to be realistic, but you can pray that I don't suffer
much pain."" A 'medical miracle?' Sure, why not? As far as the range of plausible
outcomes go, though, this one's, as far as I'm concerned, an outlier.
The Drs. Patel, being the ""on the ground"" physicians, have a different perspective from
Dr. Beavis' (although they all work very well as a team): continue to treat, monitor,
                    
assess. At a remove from the 'big picture' (although Dr. Patel the elder has a better
sense of the broad view than his younger colleague), they are hesitant to forecast a
terminus.
I was relieved to hear Dr. Beavis, who hugged me warmly and closely at the beginning
and end of our visit, say she feels that I have done ""due diligence"" in terms of leaving no
stone unturned.  Over the past nearly four years, I've travelled to Hopkins, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering and M.D. Anderson for consults, and have had a helpful phone consult
with a nurse at UCLA Medical Center. I've talked with many physicians, survivors, nurses,
friends. I've undergone three major surgeries, including removal of a brain tumor, which
my doctors encouraged me to pursue to prolong my lifespan. I've been the patient and
the patient-advocate, a 'carer' for myself. Dr. Beavis will talk to the clinical trials team at
Hopkins one more time to make sure we haven't overlooked anything (e.g. clinical trials
open to participants with brain mets, which she correctly calls a 'confounding factor' in
trials that aim to compare 'apples to apples').
Ovarian cancer is such an insidious disease, as I've said before, the ""silent killer.""
Hopefully, strides in research will continue to be made, but likely too late for me... I may
well be among the 50% of women with O.C. who don't make it past the five-year mark.
I am not really in pain. The back of my neck is sore from radiation. My stomach can
suddenly be beset by discomfort, which is worrisome. I can't eat too much. I've lost
about nine pounds, but actually feel much better at this weight, well within normal
range. The chemo side effects -- nosebleeds from Avastin, neuropathy -- are annoyances.
In terms of ""cognition, nutrition, function,"" the trio the palliative care nurse told me he
monitors closely, I am not doing badly. Again, Dr. Beavis and co. were oohing and aahing
over how well I looked and how they loved my glittery eyeshadow.
How do I feel emotionally? Strung
out/overwhelmed/scared/angry/nostalgic/defensive/anxious/grateful (a bit less this week,
but the feeling will return)/exhausted/liberated/sad/grief-
stricken/rushed/disappointed/embarrassed, trying to figure out my priorities and how
best to live my life, which is what we're all after, isn't it?
Indeed, I felt quite overwhelmed when the palliative care nurse (a small, compact, jacked
guy named Marc, with a shaved head and arms covered with tats), in an effort I'm sure
to be helpful, started unfurling the laundry list of resources and 'best practices' for
terminally ill patients: support groups/chaplaincy/penning last letters/death doulas/UCLA
Mindfulness app/medication (I was prescribed a sedative) etc. etc. My eyes were glazing
over with so much to absorb, compounding the stress of waiting on Dr. Beavis for about
2.5 hours (!) in a small examination room while I chatted with her fellow (Dr. Goulder)
and Marc, the palliative care nurse, knowing too that I wanted to get on the road back to
PA in ample daylight. Ouf!
                    
I asked Dr. Beavis what she thought about my travelling. She feels comfortable about my
taking a trip within the U.S., as she can easily connect me to medical providers just
about anywhere in this country (including Hawaii!) if I get sick while on the road. She
sounded notes of caution, though, about the Caribbean and about Paris: she's not well-
connected there; the care (not in Paris, but elsewhere) may not be of the quality I'd find
in the States; national health care systems can be complicated to navigate for foreigners
with serious illnesses. Of course, the fact that I may have said 'adieu' to Paris
permanently is an abominable thought as my 'French' self is so central to my identity, a
prospect hard for me to process along with many other disappointments. In fact, I don't
think I am very adept at 'grief work' and probably need to figure out how I'll go about it.
Right now I'm not sure what to do about these matters except feel sad about them:
""Maybe [the dream deferred] just sags/like a heavy load. Or does it explode?""
I am most grateful to my friend Sandy for driving me to Hopkins. We actually had lots of
laughs realizing our conversation had largely revolved around ""diarrhea and death"" and
the fact that we both hate to exercise. We even indulged in some cattiness, and then felt
badly about it! The laughing felt so good. We made a pit stop at Alvaro's in Harrisburg
but arrived too early for all the pizza and pasta deliciousness so we settled for breakfast
sandwiches and a few cookies.
I am also hugely grateful to my college friend David, who lives in Baltimore, for driving
me back to PA. I told David, who was my dormmate in Currier House for three years, that
I often feel like a 'hot mess' when I see him because several times when I was in the
midst of crises large or small I seem to have inflicted myself on his calm, comforting
presence. David is a therapist by training and I'm so glad that he'll soon be taking up a
part-time therapy position  after working for Medicare for many years; I am certain that
he excels in this. It was a blessing that David was once again set in my path on this trip: I
was totally strung out from the Hopkins visit and needed to vent, process, share, seek
advice. I felt safe doing so with David. ""We'll journey together,"" he said. Thank you, dear
David.
D. and I also made a pit stop at Alvaro's, picking up some yummy Italian meals for
dinner. He stayed over and left refreshed on Friday. We had plenty of time for gabbing,
laughing, swapping travel stories, and discovering new sides of each other.
It occurs to me that, should you wish to contact me, if you too wish to ""journey
together,"" you might choose to do so by gmail (willazahava1@gmail.com) or text
(814-883-6673). Honestly, if I were you, I'm not quite sure I'd know what to say to me.
But do know that until I'm not here, I very much am! And I'm just living my life, doing my
thing, which this afternoon means heading off to the synagogue for a rugelach-baking
class. Isn't it the same for all of us? XO

329,"I have not written in a while. Apologies if you were concerned. There's been a lot to
process, and I get tired during the day sometimes, and need to take a few short rests.
Otherwise, I don't feel too bad. Some mild headaches, which Tylenol can fix. Reduced
appetite and stomach discomfort from the mass in a lymph node that sits atop my
stomach; the other night I vomited during the night, which I feared might have signaled
a blockage, but for at now at least, thankfully, it appears to be a one-off. This status quo
could change at any time though. Certain activities are becoming a bit harder for me. I
worry that more severe headaches will return when/if the cancer in my brain roars back,
and that abdominal discomfort will intensify when/if the mass increases in size,
effectively blocking the lymph node. But so far, so good. Which makes me want to
'frontload' all sorts of adventures, trips, experiences, while another 'little voice' tells me
to take it easy and cocoon.
So I'm back to the pleasantness of local gatherings with my dear State College friends,
because it makes me happy to spend time with them (and then it makes me happy to
write about it): dinner at the Allen Street Grill (nicely renovated, excellent food) with
Cheryl and Sandy (always an occasion to compare clothes and jewelry with these two
smart, interesting women); dinner and gabfest as we like to do with Maria; abbreviated
chats en route to chemo and back with Jackie and Janis; piping hot ramen on a cold night
and gabbing with Helen (we have our sights set on a little jaunt to Pittsburgh later in the
winter; hope to see a few college friends there, food shop in the Strip district, and
museum hop); and lunch with three of the ""IIICs"" (the eponymous group of women
diagnosed at this stage, with whom I get together every once in a while). It was, from my
perspective, the 'best' lunch we've had in the several years that we've been meeting;
along with general catching up, we talked -- all pretense stripped away, and from
experience -- about confronting our mortality. I was particularly inspired by Deb, a
fourteen year survivor thanks to nearly constant lines of treatment, some quite
debilitating (she's currently taking a break from treatment in order to prioritize 'quality of
life'). Despite her fatigue and significant neuropathy (both of which I can relate to), she's
committed to experiences that bring her joy -- judging 4-H competitions, spending time
with friends and family, hosting, along with her husband, thirty-eight people (!) for
Christmas. While I admit that I questioned Deb's mother's admonitions to her to be stoic
(I am happy to have my feelings indulged and coddled!), I was grateful for Deb's
example of exuberance and strength against all odds -- envers et contre tout.
I should never have doubted that my friends would know what to say to me, a fear I had
expressed in my last post. After my last Caring Bridge post, I received so many beautiful
emails, texts and calls from people who shared personal details of their lives that I hadn't
known; made me intriguing, uplifting offers (trips! zoom calls! films to view! poems to
read!); and offered support and uplift in so many different ways that I felt I was
enveloped in a deliciously warm, comfortable blanket. I am trying to give each of these
                    
messages its due in responding, and in fact have just a very few to answer, which I will
do in the next few days! Apologies for the delay.
Ben and Sammi's visit on Monday, after they spend Xmas with Sammi's family in
Pittsburgh, will bring more joy. We'll have a belated Chanukah celebration, with gifts,
food (Michael's latkes -- he dropped off a large container full of them, and they are
always delicious; maybe a roast chicken or pot roast, homemade apple sauce and
rugelach), and relaxing. The plan is for us to all drive to NY on the 28th for a few days,
before Ben and I drive back here on 1/2, where Ben will stay/work for a week. Plans are
always subject to change, though, but that's our thinking for now.
The holiday has been light-filled. I had hoped to attend a few Chanukah events (public
menorah lighting etc.), but the snow, sleet and deep freeze have kept me inside for the
past few days (it's neg. 3 degrees right now!). Worth contemplating: the cruse of oil that
should have lasted for just one night when the Jews rededicated the (Second) Temple in
Jerusalem, but that burned in the Menorah for eight nights. Do you believe in miracles? I
do not, but yet every year I celebrate one... Also: the strength of spirit triumphing over
military might and power. The Maccabees leading the rebellion of the few over the many
(Ukraine?), who were imposing Hellenization in the region. The light drove out the
darkness. ""Not by might and not by power, but by spirit alone."" I believe in the power of
the spirit.
And I love when Chanukah and Xmas converge.
Have a blessed Chanukah, Christmas, Festivus, Chanamus, or (earlier this week) solstice
day.
Matisyahu, ""Miracle:""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dom_X7YXf8s 
P.S. I forgot to add something my wonderful chemo nurse, Tracy (who now greets me
with a big big hug every time I see her), said to me the other day when I had treatment:
Focus on the ""what is"" rather than the ""what if."" Another way of saying ""be in the
moment,"" ""take one day at a time,"" but somehow that 'formula' resonated with me. All of
the nurses in the chemo room are terrific. Everyday miracles?

the new year. Peace on earth.
Conversely, receiving greetings for a personally prosperous 2023, much as I appreciate
the kind sentiments and understand that exchanging them is a social ritual, feels slightly
jolting to me this year, if this is to be the year that I die. It doesn't depress me to receive
these greetings, it simply feels -- as does so much in cancer-land -- *weird.* At lunch
yesterday, my friends and I were again talking about how realistic the possibility of
miracles might be. One of my friends puts some faith in them and that belief helps keep
her afloat: I completely respect this. I respect the notion that different types of beliefs
might help some people and not others to confront challenging (health) situations. I also
understand that, visualized as a bell curve, ovarian (in my case) cancer estimates
concerning life expectancy will cluster in one spot, at the same time as there are 
'outliers.' too. The problem for me is believing in an 'outlier' scenario for which the odds
of success are so slim; one barely has a fighting chance at survival, although the
possibility in extremis does exist. Perhaps I'll feel differently the more precarious my
situation becomes. For now, what is helping me the most to navigate these murky
waters (lots of monsters lurking below the surface!) is the 'one day at a time,' 'what is' v.
'what if' philosophy. Breaking my time into 'manageable' units (days, hours, minutes)
somehow diminishes my fear and encourages agency within the realm of the possible.
Physically, I feel 'meh.' I can observe and feel a decline, but also know that I can 'rise to
the occasion' and that some days are better than others. I get winded easily and need to
rest or sit down. My stomach has been hurting the past few days (a bit of vomiting that
I'll talk to my doctor about on Tuesday, when I have chemo; reduced appetite; ability to
eat only small amounts). My very sensitive stomach did not react well to a few holiday
'excesses,' much as I enjoyed them at the time. I'll have a CT scan of my abdomen/
lungs/pelvis on Jan. 11th, then I'll meet with Dr. Patel on the 17th and we'll assess and
figure out next steps. I think I have a video meeting coming up with my palliative care
doctor here too. Presumably, then, I'll have my last infusion of Doxil/Avastin on Tuesday.
I don't want to avoid talking/thinking/writing about my illness, but I also
don't want to ignore that part of 'aging and dying,' in the words of
palliative care doctor B.J. Miller (whom I've mentioned before) can be --
and is, for me -- a ""process of crescendo through to the end."" A process of
increased intensity, comprised of beautiful, memorable moments, ""If we
love such moments ferociously,"" says Miller in his 2015 Ted Talk, ""then
maybe we can learn to live well – not in spite of death, but because of it.”
The last ten days or so have been full of such ferociously-loved moments:
                    
On Christmas Eve, my friend Cheryl (and her husband Jon) were kind enough to have me
over to spend the (bitterly cold) evening with them, my friend Sandy, and her husband
Ron.  Cheryl and Jon's apartment always feels warm and inviting, with a bit of a
southwestern vibe (evidence of their many stays in Santa Fe).  Cheryl is always solicitous
and gracious (and has many other wonderful qualities). We enjoyed a bottle of Veuve
Clicquot, a delicious meal (beef Wellington) from the Hummingbird Room (I brought
some candied spiced pecans, from an easy yet tasty David Lebovitz recipe that has
become one of my go-tos), a gorgeously decorated table, gifts, and good conversation.
Because it was the seventh night of Chanukah, Cheryl was glad that I brought my
menorah for candle-lighting, reciting the blessings, telling the story etc. The apartment
was aglow!
The day after Xmas, Ben and Sammi arrived for two days, driving from her mother's
home in Pittsburgh. I was so happy to see them! I had not seen Sammi since she left for
Vienna in May (or was it March?). I was able to catch up with her about how her
experience has evolved so far: work at the IAEA (UN-affiliated International Atomic
Energy Association), travel, life in Vienna, new friends etc. Over a champagne and
cranberry shrub cocktail, we exchanged Chanukah gifts a day or two late; enjoyed, both
nights, a pot roast I had made (Wegman's recipe: porter ensured a rich gravy), Michael's
latkes, my homemade applesauce, and my first take on rugelach, with Ben assisting
(tasty dough, but most of the apricot jam, and sugary, cinnamon-y walnut mix leaked out
during the baking!). We ran a few errands; the two days passed quickly. I always love
spending time with Ben and Sammi; they're a great team.  This is proving helpful to
them these days as they continue to navigate the aftermath of a fire in the apartment 
below theirs that caused some structural damage in their apartment. It appears that the
necessary work is being done, and the landlord is on it, but they had to buy a new bed,
replace some items, clean others to rid them of the smoke permeating them. A huge
headache, but they are handling it like pros. And most importantly, no one was hurt.
Another 'ferociously-loved' moment during Ben and Sammi's visit: an acquaintance
who's a local musician/singer (and currently an English teacher at State High), Eric,
texted me after we'd not been in touch in quite a while to see how I was faring. When I
updated him w/the recent not great health news, he asked if he could come sing for me. 
His 'mini-concert,' performed for me, Ben and Sammi, included: Bill Withers' ""Lovely
Day"" (which, unbeknownst to me, is one of Ben and Sammi's favorites), Marvin Gaye's
""What's Going On,"" some Richie Havens,  Bob Dylan, ""The Man in Me"" and one or two
others I can't recall. The final piece was the one I had sent Eric when I was thinking of
turning my blog into a performance piece (an idea I've abandoned now as too ambitious
for my horizons, although I still give it thought...): Laura Wetzler's, ""Narrow Bridge:""

This song, inspired by the writings of Kabbalah-influenced Rabbi Nachman of Breslau
--""The world, in its entirety is a narrow bridge, and the most important thing is not to
give in to one's fear"" - and to which my blog owes its' title, is most meaningful to me. I
was so touched that Eric had learned and arranged it - he even sang parts of it in
Hebrew! I was riveted by his singing. I somehow let drop that I used to be a fairly adept
guitar player, and he wanted me to pose for a pic alongside him, with my guitar.  This
has actually provided a bit of inspiration for me to get back to my guitar playing,
something I am drawn to do every once and again.
It was indeed a ""lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day.""
Ben, Sammi and I drove to the city on Wednesday. Thursday I took my brother and
nephew Isaac to Friend of a Farmer for a relaxed, lovely brunch and chat; the weather
had warmed up considerably and we walked a few blocks in the sunshine, stopping to
take a selfie or two to remember the day. In the afternoon, my friend Kay and her
husband Jeff came to visit at my mom's, followed by coffee nearby.  I am so grateful that
I've gotten to see Kay -- my girlhood friend, college dormmate, and retired Prof. of
English at UC Santa Barbara -- several times, in State College, NY, and hopefully in some
warm spot, ripe for self-indulgence, before long. And I am delighted that our nearly same
age only sons also met recently, and hit it off. Kay and I had lost contact for several
years, or rather had remained connected by the barest of threads (biannual emails on
our respective birthdays). I love her insightfulness, quirkiness, kindness, and sense of
fun. I don't think we've exhausted (scarcely) discovering all we have in common; at the
same time, we have a long history and shared memories that form the base of a
powerful bond. Kay's husband (also our college classmate), Jeff, is a neurologist, and
seemed eager to help answer some of my brain mets related questions. I loved my visit
with them 'ferociously.' :
A Part II is coming after I return to State College. I hope this post doesn't seem trivial --
you may well not wish to wade through a blow by blow account of my comings and
goings and doings -- but I somehow felt I wanted a record of this crescendo-like year's
end.

such as a personalized Spotify playlist (so thoughtful). I am responding to each message
but, as usual with me, it's taking a bit of time. Further, yesterday I was completely
knocked out after receiving my final Covid booster, and slept most of the day! My
apologies for being late w/some responses!
I am still not feeling great. My digestive system seems to be the culprit. Stomach
discomfort kept me awake part of last night. I have nearly chronic indigestion, some
nausea, frequent hiccupping. I really can't eat much without feeling distress; have lost
about 13 lbs.. Believe it or not, I am actually looking forward to my CT-scan on
Wednesday so my doctors can figure out what's going on and determine how best to
treat it.
My palliative care doc, Nikki Vithalani, w/whom I met with on Friday via videoconf.,
suggested Maalox for relief so I'll try that. She also shared something I didn't know: brain
radiation can cause extreme fatigue, of the type I've been experiencing. To combat this,
to jolt me with some energy, doctors, she said, sometimes prescribe Ritalin (?!). To me,
Ritalin has scary connotations, but we'll see what my medical team advises. Finally,
because I don't have much stamina these days, Nikki suggested I get more help to assist
me with daily tasks. While Abby picks up my groceries and helps out around the house
once a week, and while I have my house cleaned every other week, I probably could use
another two hours a day from someone, mainly to wash dishes/straighten my kitchen,
make my bed, pick up groceries, and take care of assorted odds and ends around the
house. I even had an anxiety dream in which my living space was being invaded by mess
(clothes on the floor etc.) I'm going to start working on this.
I wanted to leave a record of the remainder of my trip to the city: On Wednesday (30
Dec.), I took my mother out for a belated bday lunch at Gramercy Tavern. The walk from
my mother's apartment on 17th st. past Gramercy Park where I grew up to the Tavern on
20th bore me along on gusts of memory, archeological strata from the different 'eras' of
my life. There was 24 Gramercy Park, where my acquaintance Ross lived, a handsome,
slightly older boy who occasionally hung out with my group of neighborhood friends on
warm summer nights in the park, to which a key provided access; and the Gramercy Arts
Club, where I took piano lessons for many years with Mrs. Kay Fryer, who rewarded me
for good work with small statuettes of the great composers, and held annual recitals that
always paralyzed me with performance anxiety; and, at 34 Gramercy Park East, the
building where I grew up! A stately 1883 red brick structure in the Queen Anne style.
When I would leave for school in the morning, the ornate entryway provided a
picturesque frame for the park across the street - snow-covered in winter, blooming in
the spring, lush and green in summer, infused with the weather and smells that
accompanied each season. I never tired of that pretty view.

Gramercy Tavern is an iconic New York restaurant that I had been to once before
perhaps twenty years ago, with Michael and his family. I might describe its style as 'haut
américain' or maybe New American (although not so new anymore). The service is
distinctive: consummately professional yet also somewhat casual. Our waiter (in slacks,
apron, and a crisp man-tailored shirt with sleeves rolled up) inquired at length about food
allergies (which turned out to be necessary in my mother's case) yet also joked around
with us. I remember being struck by that style, which I don't think you'd encounter in a
French restaurant of the same caliber, the first time I tried GT. Following a glass of
Prosecco, we opted for the three-course ""Greenmarket Lunch,"" featuring the outstanding
produce from the Union Square Greenmarket down the street. I had a delicious celeriac
(a new taste for me) soup; it tasted so rich I thought it had cream in it but it only
featured a bit of butter (there was an amuse-bouche too, but I forget what it was). For
our main dish we both had grilled skate, perfectly cooked (I usually give credit only to
French restaurants for cooking fish so beautifully) on top of a bed of mini greenmarket
veggies and surrounded by some sort of delicious coulis. For dessert, we split a
cheesecake (small, oval-shaped) w/a ball of clementine (?) sorbet, and some fresh pear
sorbet. Excellent coffee. And a small bowl of the most perfect, flavorful Concord grapes
to finish. The portions were rather small and I ate very slowly so fortunately the meal did
not bother my stomach. I'm glad that we sat in the (quiet!) main dining room rather than
the bustling tavern/bar area up front, where patrons were eating appetizing looking
hamburgers grilled on a wood fire, among other more casual dishes.
The year ended wonderfully, as I spent part of the day with two of my best friends from
grade school, Eva and Zia. I met Zia (a writer, who also teaches writing at the New
School) at a store we had wanted to visit since I had read a NYTimes article about it: the
New York branch of Sabayasachi (https://sabyasachi.com/password). The designer
Sabayasachi is credited with having 'reinvented the sari' largely (but not exclusively) for
a wealthy Indian-American (in the case of the NY boutique) clientele (if you're a sucker
for reality shows, as I am [!], check out ""Indian Weddings""). All we could say on entering
the boutique (way west on Christopher St.) through massive teak (?) doors is that we felt
we were in another world, in a beyond opulent décor featuring Indian tapestries, objects,
calligraphy; lots of chinoiserie; vases, porcelain, furniture that would not be out of place
at Versailles; dozens of crystal chandeliers; elegantly-bound editions of literary classics
(Voltaire) plus colonial-era literature (Kipling). Within this fantasy environment, the
wedding clothing, pashminas, jewelry -- all highly ornate -- are displayed. There were a
few customers (mainly Indian and Indian-American) trying on wedding clothing; I frankly
thought the clothing looked a bit more 'glitzy' than it does on Sabayaschi's Instagram. I
thought I might buy myself a scarf but the prices were prohibitive. The staff, however,
was lovely (the manager seemed like he might be Indian but told us he was half-Middle
Eastern, half-Danish) and let us spend quite a while there, visitors at a museum. There is
                    
likely a sociological angle to this place and the entire upscale Indian wedding industry,
I'm sure; perhaps Zia will be able to parse it, as she and her mom Madhur are definitely
better attuned to Indian culture than I am. We certainly had fun gawking!
We headed towards Zia's mother and stepfather's house on W. 12th street -- another jolt
from the past as this is the same apartment where I spent *hours* as a teenager and pre-
teen, sleeping over in the bedroom Zia shared with her two sisters; locking ourselves in
the bathroom when we wanted to have gossipy conversations; sometimes sleeping on
the floor in the living room, on a bed of comfy pillows and blankets. Zia's parents weren't
home, but let us use the apartment for the delightful lunch that Zia prepared. Eva (who
lives in Sag Harbor, LI, with her husband Drew, and currently works in insurance) arrived
and, over lunch and a glass of Pinot Grigio, we had a great conversation that seemed to
roam between past and present, milestones and challenges (marriages, relationships,
illness, aging parents), sprinkled with whatever wisdom we've picked up over the years.
Lots of laughs. I had brought the diary I kept the summer of 1974 (we were all 15), which
captured so many vignettes from that summer featuring the three of us, like a sweltering
summer evening when about a dozen of us classmates hung out at the San Gennaro
street fair in Little Italy, intoxicated by the smell of sizzling Italian sausage and onions
and zeppoli, the lights of the city, and the unsurpassed feeling of independence.
New Year's Eve I stayed in and made dinner (linguine with a lemon cream sauce) for my
mother and Arnold, to go with our Veuve Clicquot! I was so tired I didn't even make it to
midnight. 
Ben and I drove back to State College on 1/2. He teleworked here and helped me out for
the week. He was a darling in every way, and I really appreciated (and needed) his help.
He's headed to Boulder, CO, soon to visit his friend Nolan while he works from there. The
guys will do lots of skiing, I'm sure.

333,"I don't have much of a medical update to share. I am *still* awaiting results of the CT-
scan (pelvis/abdomen/lungs) I had last Wednesday, which I am supposed to discuss with
Dr. Patel tomorrow morning in order to assess my condition and develop a treatment
plan. I've left three messages with Dr. Patel's office today to see if they can
access/expedite the report and have also called Geisinger's Radiology department. Very
frustrating. I also need to write a letter to Aetna after receiving an astronomical bill for
my last two chemo treatments, from Nov. and Dec. 2022. I had apparently maxed out
my coverage for these treatments, but of course I was never alerted to this. I don't
believe this cap was even mentioned in the Explanation of Benefits I received. Grrrr! So
frustrating.
If only I had my usual energy to throw myself full throttle into combatting these two
problems, which must be resolved. The first one will likely resolve itself, but I may not
have the results of the CT-scan before I talk to Dr. Patel tomorrow, unfortunately. The
second problem - battling the insurance company, appealing the charge -- will require
stamina, focus and determination, all of which I have historically prided myself on. But
I've not been feeling well for a few weeks, and this makes routine (and less routine)
                    
tasks arduous to perform. I find myself (still) very tired, winded, and lacking  appetite.
I'm consuming only liquids now, but trying to bulk up with milkshakes, Carnation instant
breakfast, soup etc. Have lost about 15 pounds, and should not lose much more. My PCP,
Paul Damaske, whom I saw on Friday (very compassionate guy, who's keeping close
track of me along with my other doctors here) attributed much of how I'm feeling to -
simply - cancer. After nearly four years of treatment, my body is tired. Some of my
'systems' (e.g. digestive) may be slowing down. Radiation also causes fatigue. He gave
me another med, Protonix, for my stomach/digestive issues, and I also started taking
something like Maalox that my palliative care doctor proposed. Hoping for another
""honeymoon period.""
[Update on my update: Dr. Patel's office just wrote. They said they had called the
radiologist, who promised to write his report for Dr. Patel to read before I see him
tomorrow morning. Whew. Problem #1 solved].[Update #2: I see that the radiologist's
report has been uploaded to my portal. But now I'm too scared to read it. I may wait for
Dr. Patel to parse it for me tomorrow morning].
I feel the impulse to censor or 'curate' my medical update as I am conscious of not
wanting to concern, even alarm, those reading this entry.
Visits with friends have definitely provided cheer over the past few weeks. My friends
Jackie and Monique came for tea on consecutive days, Monique bearing a large container
of homemade chicken soup (she's been supplying me with this 'Jewish penicillin' at
critical junctures ever since I was in the hospital after Ben was born nearly twenty-eight
years ago!). The day after Jackie's visit, she insisted on hand delivering a mocha chip
milkshake from Meyer's Dairy (liquid goodness, I indulged in a chocolate root beer float
today) and Wegman's OMG Tomato Soup (I'm clueless about the name). Have also
zoomed with my grade school friend Jane, who recently sold her house on Cape Cod and
moved to Hawaii (her invitation to visit is tempting....); my former grad student turned
colleague and good friend, Denis; and, this evening, my cousin. In touch with other
friends via text, email etc. Ben is in Boulder, Colorado for a few weeks, teleworking and
skiing and hanging out with friends and otherwise 'livin' the life,' but we're in touch every
day. He loves it there!

__________________________________________________________________________________
Over the many years I taught French ""civilization"" (we now opt for the far less
'imperialistic' and historically more accurate moniker of ""culture and society""), I always
looked forward to teaching the sessions on ""Visions de la mort au Moyen Age"" (Visions of
Death in the Middle Ages). Why? Objects such as memento mori or frescoes in
churchyards depicting the danse macabre, seemed so alien to me and my students in
                    
their strangeness, underscoring the 'pastness of the past.' This topic would never fail,
also, to generate interesting discussions (in French!) on topics ranging over Goth culture,
the AIDS quilt, celebrations of life, depictions of death in popular culture (today, I'm
certain that COVID and its fallout would be in the mix as well, considered in parallel with
the Black Plague; I remember in the very early days of COVID, around March 2020, I had
a dream in which a black-robed, masked, plague-doctor appeared!).
I'm not sure where I want to go with this musing. I'm too lazy (and likely not well-
informed enough) to take on a full-fledged comparison of 'images of and attitudes
towards death in the Middle Ages and today.' That would truly be an undertaking
doomed to failure.  I think I simply want to say that those discussions, and those images,
have stayed with me, and have much greater resonance for me now. I wonder if any of
the students in my classes had experienced death closely enough (within their families
or among friends, for example) to be moved (or even traumatized) by these images?
When I taught them, it was always at an intellectual remove.
How does one 'die well,' as various illustrated tracts from the 15th century onwards
asked (or rather advised)? In the Middle Ages, the Ars Moriendi, likely written by
churchmen, were treatises prescribing behaviors constituting a 'good death.' In the
context of the times, this meant a death preceded by an upright Christian life and ending
with the passage of body and soul to heaven, after angels and devils warred over the
mortal flesh until the very end (this was graphically, and sometimes gruesomely,
depicted in woodcuts accompanying the text). One can surmise that the ultimate end of
such treatises was to reinforce the power of the Church and encourage obedience. They
ultimately functioned as technologies of control and discipline.
And what of today? I just ordered B.J. Miller's new book, The Beginner's Guide to the End,
whose approach, as I understand it, is eminently practical; one chapter is entitled ""How
to write a eulogy and an obituary."" A good death, in Miller's vision, might be one in which
all the practical matters of dying (paying for the funeral, writing the obituary, choosing
burial options etc.) are dispensed with expertly. But my attention and imagination shift,
for the moment, to Georges Montorgeuil's fanciful vision of revelers high above
Montmartre, tutelar spirits inhabiting this magical place. They float joyfully, perhaps
headed not so much 'up' but out, into a vaporous sky, free, holding hands and kicking up
their heels. I guess I'd like to think of a 'good death' not as the fearful vision of the Ars
moriendi but something akin to Montorgeuil 'vie à Montmartre,' devoid of acute bodily
suffering, joyful in having lived well, free-floating.
[I think my train of thought is not yet well-developed here, but these images have been
on my mind lately!]

334,"I was too tired and stressed to write anything on Monday or Tuesday as I awoke
extremely early both days for bloodwork, magnesium infusion, meeting with Dr. Patel,
vitamin B-12 injection etc. After having slept twelve hours last night (which seems to be
what I need these days), I'm able to provide an update.
                    
I'm afraid the update may seem 'anticlimactic' as it certainly didn't convey any news I
didn't expect, except for that of a new spot on my liver (about 1 cm+ in size; will be
targeted by my next course of chemo). Progression of disease, totally expected. The
cancer progresses gradually, and is now present in my lymph nodes, on my liver, in my
brain and likely elsewhere (a few tumors at the base of my abdomen). The mass in the
lymph node *behind* my stomach (I actually thought it lay on top of my stomach) is
quite sizeable. I haven't actually read the report yet (but will); Dr. Patel interpreted it for
me, and I'll ask Dr. Beavis about it, too.
I asked if radiating the mass in my lymph node was possible; Dr. Patel said that, because
of the location of the lymph node, radiating it would entail piercing through other organs
and healthy tissue, a much too toxic option.
Dr. Patel, unfortunately, does not have a definitive explanation of my recent symptoms
(fatigue, lack of appetite and weight loss, stomach discomfort). He ruled out organ
function (my liver, kidney functioning normally) and low hemoglobin, platelet, or white
blood cell count (these are ok as well). The stomach discomfort might be due to a partial
blockage (which we'll only worry about if I'm vomiting chronically, which I'm not); the
fatigue can be partially attributed to the chemo drugs and radiation. Stress could
certainly cause or accentuate all these symptoms. Dr. Patel had another theory that had
to do with magnesium and metabolism but 'llI have to look at my notes for the details. I
now have a small cornucopia of meds targeting my digestion, nausea etc. I will take
them all, simultaneously, and see if that helps.
I might try a low dose of Ritalin for an energy boost.
I need to maintain my weight and not lose more; today it seems to be stable (lots of
milkshakes and Carnation instant breakfast!).
One piece of good news, per Dr. Patel: my symptoms do not signal the stage
immediately preceding death (LOL - three cheers for small victories!). Am I happy to be
here? Without a doubt.
Another piece of good news: for *now* (but this can change quickly) my head/brain are
'behaving.' I'm fearful of a 'double whammy' (brain stuff + all the rest), but so far I've
managed to stave this off. Brain MRI in about a month and a half.
Good news #3: both Dr. Patel and his nurse feel I look quite well, belying the seriousness
of my condition.
We are next (and perhaps finally?) going to try a chemo drug I've not been given before,
called Alimta (Pemetrexid), along with Avastin. I need to talk to Dr. Beavis and find out
                    
why they wish to continue w/Avastin, if the previous treatments with it have not worked
or worked well. Avastin gives me nosebleeds, and I always worry about the risk of bowel
perforation. If I do decide to go ahead with this combo (of course, I could stop, or could
have stopped, treatment at any point, such as before my brain surgery, in which case I'd
be dead by now but would have avoided some of the real discomfort I'm experiencing
currently), I'll be infused every three weeks. It's all about balancing my quality of life
against the effects, and effectiveness, of the treatment. At the moment, my quality of
life seems to have taken a dip, but again: am I glad to be here, driving in my car
listening to NPR, picking up a milkshake at Meyer's Dairy, chatting with store clerks,
enjoying the mundanities of living? Absolutely!
May be making some progress on getting additional help around the house, which I
sorely need. Something like 1-2 hours a day, every day, and we'll see how it goes after
that. 
While I never like to plan too far in advance these days, I'm still hoping my beloved grad
school friends will arrive in late Jan. on what we're calling the ""spoil her rotten express""
for a weekend of laughs and silliness and pampering. 
Also have tentatively planned five days of pool, a sparkling bay, spa, lounging and *sun*
with another dear friend in early Feb. - if things remain stable. I think it will do me good.
Can you guess where we're headed (no spoilers, for the two or three of you who know!)?",2,fear,0.9437757,0.0023933458,0.0029134753,0.9437757,0.0025497056,0.02458648,0.014855614,0.008925706
335,"Health report: status quo, i.e. 'new normal,' i.e. fatigue, shortness of breath on even
relatively mild exertion, discomfort in my stomach/abdominal area, decreased appetite
and preference for liquids (maintaining weight loss of about 14 lbs.; plenty of milk
shakes, root beer floats [thank you, Lisa, for bringing me one today!], Carnation instant 
breakfast and some soft foods like bananas). I can't really say I'm in pain, although if I
eat the wrong thing, I experience cramping or other discomfort in my stomach. My
(in)digestion is wonky.
Very happy to be here, it goes without saying. In fact, I have taken offense, or been
taken aback, or taken...somewhere where alarm bells are ringing, when, for the first
time, two of my doctors recently addressed the issue of my stopping treatment. My
palliative care doc, Dr. Vithalani, asked me point blank if I wanted to pursue the next line
of treatment. I know, of course, that the choice is always mine, but somehow the
possibility never occurred to me as a real option, one that I would consider seriously. She
suggested that while stopping treatment might shorten my lifespan (further), it might
also improve the quality of the life I have left (off chemo for several weeks now while
awaiting insurance pre-certification for Alimta, I have indeed been feeling better,
although spending time with friends is really the elixir that energizes me and lifts my
spirits; I felt that today over lunch at a newish ramen place in town with my friend Helen,
who dazzled me with stories of her recent trip to Israel, a country that enthralled me
when I visited, and also on Monday, when Kathryn, Sandy, and Cheryl came over for
convo and...milkshakes! Am greatly looking forward to the arrival tomorrow of Vinni,
Shanny and Isa, my dear grad school friends, for two days of giggles and various
indulgences). Dr. Beavis also suggested yesterday that I might try the new chemo drug,
Alimta (Pemetrexid), see how I react to it, and discontinue it if it doesn't sit well with me.
Stopping treatment is of course a scary prospect. Feels like free fall. Even if I'm receiving
the chemo somewhat prophylactically, I still have some notion (illusion?) of control over
my disease as long as I'm in treatment. But we're not at the critical juncture yet. Dr.
Beavis has mentioned one final (?) line of (post-Alimta) treatment, for which I would have
to have my tumor tested and for which there also appears to be a national shortage of a
necessary reagent. I'm not feeling terribly optimistic about this possibility.
I am still haggling with Aetna over an astronomical bill for two chemo treatments. And
now I am also somewhat haggling with Dr. Patel's office over whether or not he will write
a letter in support of my appeal. Decidedly, this is not bringing me joy.
                    
What is leaving me more time for whatever brings me joy is the additional home help
I've  been able to arrange through sheer force of will(apower) - and with a big thanks to
Maria. I now have one of three very nice women coming in *every day* for 1-2 hours to
do a mix of cleaning/straightening/groceries/errands (nothing medical); I'm also
engaging them in a big downsizing/organizing effort throughout my house, an
undertaking that, admittedly, may take a while but that is making me feel,
psychologically and emotionally, much happier -- which leads me to my recent dreams.
THEMES
'Living in the material world…'
'The things they carried.' What we take with us v. what we leave behind…
Unfinished business.
Going on a journey and nothing must be left behind, unaccounted for. On the other hand,
once it’s all packed, everything must be left behind.
""Don’t leave a mess"" (Miller and Berger, _A Beginner’s Guide to the End_; guess I flunked
that chapter :{)
Feeling overwhelmed; events and phenomena over which I have little to no control, yet I
still try to control them (flailing all the while). Maybe the key is to relinquish control and
have faith that everything will be alright.
DREAMS
I've essentially had the same dream every night for the past several weeks: I have to
pack up, clean up etc. for a trip or move of some sort. It's a monumental job and
everything's a mess. Meanwhile, there's lots of other activity going on: sometimes it’s an
activity I’d much rather be pursuing (like swimming in an enticing ocean), other times it’s
another major responsibility I have to acquit, and I’m not really succeeding at anything!
Snapshots:
Packing, huge mess of clothes strewn everywhere. Do I have enough space in my
suitcases, do I even have enough suitcases? (In another dream: suitcases bulging, I'm
trying to push them up onto some kind of overhead rack as on a train, with difficulty).
In one bin of stuff to pack: some pretty, small framed prints and artifacts from late 19th
c? Old. But one was contained in a gaudy, bling-y frame with the name “Gucci""
prominently spelled out in rhinestones.
                    
In the midst of all this frantic packing  – other people around – I decide to take a shower
and wash my hair (light switches to turn on overhead lights in shower don’t work). I’m
taking the shower but know that I have much else to take care of, including the packing.
I’m starting to get tired.
I have a class to teach (recurring theme in many of my dreams). I’m barely keeping it
(the class) together. This one concerns the Belle Epoque. The session I’m supposed to
cover that day centers on posters and graphic art in general, a subject I know well. I
realize that I can simplify things for myself by simply asking the class: Why is this era
called “L’âge du papier?” I’m glad to have hit on this idea because I realize that the
question will get us into the subject of technology and its importance. But I also realize
that I’m barely on top of this class. There appears to be an essay due soon or a big test
that I’m supposed to make everyone aware of, but I’m clueless. There’s an undercurrent
of (my) worry about this important fact.
Related: I'm showing up for the last class session of a course in which I had hardly made
an appearance all semester. Much to my surprise, a few of the students actually show
up; I think they want to get their homework assignments returned after waiting nearly all
semester. Did this take place in the old NBS (my grade/high school) building? And I think
students from this class were combined with those (in the same room) of another one I
was teaching.
Many tasks to take care of, confusion, fatigue, feeling overwhelmed. Have to send
something in the mail but it becomes very complicated because I don't have an
envelope, nor perhaps a stamp. Go out looking for these, need to walk very far; some of
the route completely unfamiliar (buildings in a city I do not recognize; I seem not to be
taking the most direct route). Then I somehow realize I am near NYU (my graduate
school alma mater) and find Bobst Library. Get to Bobst Library, speak with a janitor or
handyman who implies he can get me an envelope but this turns out to be complicated (I
need to wait for the envelope/stamp, or go somewhere else to get it).
I am staying “at my mother and father’s” for the summer. I am recounting this to
someone on the phone, sort of unhappily. Is it our old apartment in Gramercy Park
(where I lived most of my life, at least on and off, from age 6-mid 20s)? This apartment,
at least, is neat and very quiet, contrasting with the chaos of the rest of the dream.
I thought I had cleaned up a huge mess that we (+ other people, family members?) had
to take care of before leaving the premises of an apartment that belonged to someone
else (perhaps we had rented it). Then I realize there's *much more* to clean out/pack up
than I had first imagined -- entire shelves and closets bulging with stuff. One of these
spaces looks like my spice cabinet. I suggest putting each jar of spices/herbs in a plastic
bag and sealing it, but someone (my mother?) thinks it will attract bugs. There are also
half-used bottles of vinegar, oils etc. I don't know what to do with them. There's so much
                    
stuff, everywhere! I feel totally overwhelmed. I think the part about being in my mother
and father’s calm apartment (above) was actually the last part of the dream.
Mom seems younger in the dream, as do mom and dad in Gramercy Park – an earlier era
of my life.
Allen E. (former therapist) in dream. He’s mad at me because I’ve somehow ‘messed up’
with therapy, perhaps neglected to attend group sessions, done something wrong. He
appears stern and chastising, and I feel sheepish and flustered. In another part of that
dream (which was part of larger dream), a young boy (either little Ben or Ethan or
amalgam) and I are in AE’s presence to do some therapy work. The boy has some
recrimination of me that he wishes to express (although not meanly or angrily, just
pretty matter-of-factly) but I preempt him by saying what *I* think is going wrong in our
dynamic, ie my and the boy's>grammar??). I start speaking rather loudly and
assertively, depriving the boy of the opportunity to speak.
Last night: Yes, as in all the dreams, mess is omnipresent. But somehow I'm able to fish
out an outfit that I put on: a turtleneck or cowl neck gray cashmere-like form-fitting
sweater and a black skirt. I look at my profile and think I look quite attractive; the weight
loss flatters me. I also put on some blingy sparkly earrings with matching necklace. Am a
bit disappointed as it's not the blingy necklace I had expected to wear but a nice yet
simple silver chain with small horseshoes dangling from it. My hair is about shoulder
length and looks good. Pretty sure action in this dream also takes place in our Gramercy
Park apartment!
Next, I am in bathroom of this apartment and see something pushing up from under the
floor. I expect it might be a groundhog but it is a cat! It is gray (mottled), has matted
hair, semi-closed eyes, and looks like it's 'been through the wringer."" I pick up cat and
take it next door to bedroom (my old bedroom in the apartment!) to give to little Ben (or
Ethan?), who is in bed. The cat escapes from Ben's hands, however, and somehow finds
another hole in the floor of the room that s/he falls into or escapes through. The cat is
gone. [IRL: My neighbors Paul and Marcia have sent two emails to the other condo
owners in our complex to let us know their cat, Luther, is missing; I have been worried
about this].
Why all the concern w/'stuff' in the dreams while seemingly less concern about people
(taking or leaving them). Does the 'stuff' represent the people? Is my overconcern with
the 'stuff' obscuring my tending to my people? Paging Dr. Freud...

graduate studies at NYU, through the Paris years and subsequent trips to France (many),
and on through weddings, divorces, kids, boyfriends, deaths and other milestones. The
time Shanny put salt instead of sugar in the apple pie we were serving our guests in
Paris, who hoped for a 'taste' of American Thanksgiving. The countless dinner parties
Vinni, Shanny and I organized in Paris for the interesting local pals we had met in
                    
seminars at Sciences Po and through other friends. The adventuresome trips Vinni and I
took to London, Madrid (yes, we really did get lost one freezing New Year's Eve outside a
bullfighting ring!). Isa and Rob's beautiful wedding (we caravaned from NY); her mother,
Mathé, who became our Parisian 'mom' during our stays in the capital;
*Hugging;
*'Losing' our phones in my house;
*Giggling uncontrollably, shaking with huge bursts of laughter over and over...
*Non-stop talking, sharing, digging deep, being silly, getting real, shedding tears: our
kids (their triumphs and challenges) and aging parents; our clothes (where did you get
that cute sweater?); our health; our family histories; work, retirement, and beyond; a
recent French film, _De son vivant,_ about a terminally ill cancer patient and his
compassionate oncologist; my own cancer journey; other health challenges; beliefs
about what happens after death; endings/beginnings; friendship.
Afterwards I reflected that the two days were like _un condensé_ (a condensed version)
of our forty years of friendship.
My mood was euphoric.
They took care of me. I hope I have helped take care of them.
I wish days like these would never end. Nourishment for the soul, mind and body. Trust.
Laughter and fun.
Parce que c'étaient elles, parce que c'était moi.

Monday night I was equally nourished by a zoom call with two of my 'besties' from high
school, Zia and Eva, whom I recently saw in NY. My pals of a half-century. How we've
changed, how we've remained the same, what the journey's been like. I open a yearbook
or one of my diaries and see us there, in our blue pleated skirts, white blouses and knee
socks, our innocent images belying all the mischief we were up to, all the longings,
curiosity, and at times inner chaos of our teenage years in NY.
*****
And Monday, if all goes as planned (still a bit nervous about jinxing myself), I'll fly
towards warmer climes for five days of poolside relaxation, spa indulgences, and
                    
whatever hijinks my dear friend Kay (whom I've know the longest of all, since we met
one summer when we were twelve in Amherst, MA, as castmates in a production of _The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer_ ) has dreamed up for us.
****
I remember that when I was little my cousins gave me a book entitled _A Friend is
Someone who Likes You,_ by Joan Walsh Anglund. It was really my first introduction to
the *notion* of friendship, which has meant so much to me over the years. Thank you,
dear friends, both those whose roots plunge back into the past along with mine and
those of more recent date.
Maybe B.J. Miller is calling it again: ""I am asking we make space so that aging
and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.""
P.S. I did a thing. I had my hair, skimpy as it is, cut and colored for the first time in
several years.  This is the second time my hair has grown back since I was diagnosed in
2019. I am pleased to witness my skin (i.e. hair) regenerating in this way and am told
that my ultra-short cut is 'cute.'

...and it did the trick. Now if they would just get rid of that scary governor...
At the Mandarin Oriental (henceforward MO), the staff smiles, pampers, coddles, flirts,
brings you cucumber and lemon water by the pool, fixes a tropical fruit salad of dragon
fruit and pineapple, squeezes fresh orange juice, concocts the most beautiful purple
cocktail: Prosecco, hibiscus, elderflower liqueur; calms you with meditation and
visualization in a room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking glistening Biscayne Bay;
softly plays Burt Bacharach tunes for you in the lounge.
Curling up in a soft towel for a rest by the infinity pool or feeling my body absorb the
sun's enlivening rays; jacuzzi. Restful sleeps.
Spa time: smells divine (vaguely woodsy and leathery); tea ritual on arrival (rejuvenating
cool hibiscus tea, on a tray with warm towels and vibrantly colored fresh blossoms);
fluffy robes, slippers; facial (masque, creams, peels, exfoliants, lip balm, heat, cool,
gentle massage); manicure (I brought one of my favorite OPI shades, ""Princesses Rule!);
aromatherapy steam room (feel the pores open, the body exude moisture covering you
in rivulets); visualization (I am encased in an aqua blue, green and pink cocoon, floating
high above); deep breathing; shower (hot water pummeling you from all sides, rosemary-
scented bath gel); feeling so pleasantly in touch with my body, for the moment no longer
a source of pain.
Food: dinner two nights at La Mar, the hotel restaurant, Peruvian with some Asian fusion.
Sat outside overlooking the glittery (glitzy?) Miami skyline. Bustling place, bustling city.
Lots of ceviche: octopus, calamari, prawns, scallops, tuna marinated in lime, sometimes
tamarind, cilantro and other deliciousness. Empanadas. Mojitos! Pisco sours! Dulce de
leche, tres leches cake w/banana.
Other night ventured 'off campus' to Cafe La Trova in Little Havana. Food maybe a B+
(tried something with lime-marinated pork and pineapple rice; prawns w/white beans in a
brown sauce), drinks A+ (some sort of amazing frozen Campari concoction). Atmosphere
A+: packed place, 'old Havana' décor (including a vintage Cuban car in one corner), live
music (intoxicating blend of African, Caribbean, European and other rhythms that you
*can't not* move to; people dancing between tables, at the bar, bartenders also breaking
out their trumpets, maracas, bongos, cowbells). Chica, welcome to Miami!
Lovely lunch with my very dear aunt Marlene and cousin Julie, who were kind enough to
drive 1.5 hours from Boca, where they live, to have lunch with me and Kay. Yummy fresh
                    
salmon burger, iced tea at River Oyster Bar. Delightful to see them and spend time
together.
Many in Miami speak only Spanish; this surprised me. You really don't need English at all
to get by. Although this proved a bit frustrating once or twice (e.g. arranging to have a
wheelchair pick me up in the Miami airport), I found it pleasantly dépaysant. Heavily
Latinx and generally international city: encountered folks from Puerto Rico, Haiti, France,
Cuba, Peru etc.
'Old money' (i.e. 40-something man in attire of a New England preppy>the Palm Beach
crowd?) v. 'new' (lots of bling, heavy gold watches, women in sparkly skin tight clothing,
thigh-high boots). Admittedly, my sample is small.
And then there was Kay. We met in about 1971 in Amherst, MA (she lived there, I was
summering there while my father taught at UMass), through a local production of ""The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" (Kay, a dancer, choreographed; I played Aunt Polly). We
became fast friends and visited one another in NY and Amherst throughout middle and
high school; my trips to Amherst would always involve a walk down to the back door of
the Grist Mill restaurant to buy the crispest French fries straight out of the fryer in the
kitchen. We wound up classmates - even dormmates - at Harvard, but with different
friend groups. We drifted a bit after that -- always keeping in touch through annual
birthday phone calls and occasional get-togethers, but our connection became slightly
perfunctory. My illness brought us back together, even back to the closeness of our
earliest friendship, with Kay visiting me in State College last year and now agreeing
enthusiastically, and kindly, to take this trip with me (and a bit for me too, I suspect).
Everyone should have a Kay in their life.
Who else would:
>Gift me, on arrival, with a pair of white sunglasses, the better to look glam (or some
version of it!) by the pool?
>Gift me, soon after, with a Mandarin Oriental cap and fan pin (the fan being the logo of
MO), so we'd be decked out in full regalia as ""Friends of MO?"" This was all documented in
photos, of course. The cap had a decal on it that said ""50+,"" which we soon realized
would become the theme of our visit: the anniversary of our 50+ years of friendship. This
theme was in part inspired by the emails I received from MO addressed to ""Mr. Young""
and those Kay received addressed to ""Ms. Silverman,"" and wishing us a happy
anniversary!
>Purchase an enormous, oversized stuffed rabbit in the hotel gift shop just because ""she
had to have it?"" She dubbed the rabbit...MO (Moe?) and we quickly anthropomorphized
                    
him (her? them?), envisioning him screaming for dear life when stuffed into Kay's
suitcase for her flight from Miami to San Antonio, to visit her soon to be married son?
>Be dramatic, witty, uproariously funny, real, considerate, supportive, trustworthy, and
easygoing? Now I understand why we look giddy and gleeful in the photo taken of us
perhaps fifty years ago! Now I understand why we always stayed up half the night during
our sleepovers, digging deep into the existential questions! Study the present to
understand the past.
>Carry a clutch covered in green grass and wear funky platform sandals topped by a
huge tuft of brown fluff -- and adopt MO the rabbit --  because she insists she loves
things that ""she can pat?""
>Ensure I felt comfortable and enjoyed myself?
""Parce que c'était [elle], parce que c'était moi.""
The trip felt the antithesis of death-centric; au contraire, it was rejuvenating and life-
affirming. I actually felt...healthy? Kay suggested that I might do more of this type of
travel as it felt so vivifying. The travel, the prospect of which I had been nervous about,
was not unmanageable. Sedona, anyone?The trick: a wheelchair in the airport.
Yes, totally and completely self-indulgent I know. Don't hate me.
**********************************************************************************
Back to Department of ssdd: Have put off my new line of chemo for a few more days
since, on my return home, I discovered that my copay would be $700 for each
treatment, once every three weeks. Lily Oncology Support Center denied my application
for their Savings Card Program. I will take a few days to see whether I am eligible for any
other type of support. Of course, if Alimta does indeed turn out to be the silver bullet it
will be worth it, but...yikes. Meanwhile, I go without treatment.  Also, I continue to haggle
with Aetna about the $25K they billed me for my last two chemo treatments of 2022,
bills that I am appealing. I think big pharma + the insurance companies are conspiring to
kill me.

341,"Health update: Since returning from my fab trip to Miami recently, I started a new, and
ostensibly final, course of chemo last Friday: Alimta (new drug for me) + Avastin. One
treatment every three weeks; a three-day course of steroids + folic acid to help
                    
absorption. A three-hour magnesium infusion this past week as my level was quite low.
No notable side effects yet except fatigue. 
March 13th will bring another brain MRI, as it's been three months since my last one.
Thankfully, as if my brain 'knew' I would need my energy to contend with
abdominal/stomach discomfort and fatigue, it has been 'behaving' the past few months.
That is, no crippling headaches thank goodness, although I may feel a bit of swelling in
the area of my cerebellum when I'm lying on my right side or on my back at night.
What happens after this course of chemo? How will this all play out? I don't know.
Another treatment option? Free fall? A miraculous feat of further survival? I'd love to
make it to the five-year mark in April 2024.
I am hanging in. I am feeling so-so. Some things are becoming harder for me. Lifting
anything even remotely heavy causes a tugging or tearing sensation in my lower
abdomen, where tumors are situated (I remember how difficult it became for me to carry
my briefcase to my car right before I was first diagnosed). My digestion is still a bit
wonky and I have to be careful (but drinking healthy smoothies in the morning with all
sorts of fresh fruit, yogurt, açai juice, flax seed etc. helps). I feel tired a lot but still
haven't tested the Ritalin I was prescribed.
I find myself in a rather strange 'headspace' now. I sometimes feel alienated in normal
social situations. Or perhaps rather, I sometimes feel I'm living in a bubble, on another
plane. I inhabit a resolutely existential space, dealing often 24/7 (yes, in my dreams too!)
with the most profound existential questions about mortality, legacy, suffering, love and
transition -- whether I'm walking through the peaceful garden at the Centre County
Memorial Park, recognizing the markers of fellow congregants who will one day be my
neighbors or sitting in a room surrounded by urns and caskets, discussing Jewish burial
customs with the director at the Koch Funeral Home (needless to say, my cultural
historian's curiosity was piqued by this convo).
I'm downsizing, simplifying, streamlining. The two wonderful young women who help me
out for an hour or two each day are organizing all my closets, opening up space. My
house feels airy, light, stripped of things that (pace Marie Kondo) do not 'bring me joy.'
This helps me so much psychologically. I'm also paring down my circle of acquaintances.
I hesitate to mention this as I think it sounds 'mean' but I'm involved in a process of
clarifying. In the end, it's not hard.
I am so grateful to the friends who have truly made the effort to understand my reality,
to 'hold space' for me through this journey and be with me physically when they can. I
hope you know who you are. Thank you for not fearing being afraid, sad, repelled, upset,
confused, disoriented. You certainly make me feel less alone. Without seeming arrogant,
I hope you feel in some way that it's a privilege to be part of this journey, and that it
                    
might make it easier when you need to confront something similar down the line. You'll
have wise(r) perspective. So I hope I've been able to provide some type of service (dare I
say gift?) for you in that way. We've been lucky that way, I guess. In the end, these
relationships distill into love, authenticity, gratitude. And that's a magical thing.
I appreciate a good number of other well-wishers. Some I know less well than others, or
for less time than my oldest friends, so I understand the challenges (for you) of
translating emotions into words and actions.
Despite what I've written above, I remain very much 'in the world,' or perhaps 'between
two kingdoms,' as Susan Sontag observes in ""Illness as Metaphor."" A few gratitude-
inducing items, currently:
>Ben is here! For almost two weeks. He's working remotely and has installed his gentle,
helpful, calm, kind, caring, droll self in our home, in his bedroom upstairs. His presence
makes me feel so much better. Although it's become more difficult, I just *had* to do
some cooking for his arrival: homemade stuffed shells w/homemade sauce etc. and
Indian rice pudding (both came out very well but it's a heavy combo, perhaps my
inadvertent nod to Mardi Gras). This week I'll also make an Ottolenghi salad with braised
fennel.
>The small army of helpers who now pop in every day, *eradicating* the series of
dreams I was having about gigantic messes that I need to clean up while feeling
powerless and overwhelmed.
>My oncology nurses -- Brianne, Tracey, Rachel, Beth, Jess -- who have become friends; 
>The days are getting longer! I def. want to make it to fresh asparagus season, so I can
drive out among the Amish farms and buy armfuls of them for tasty asparagus soup.
>We're in the Pisces zone! I'm picking up on the energy of my moon sign (4 March), and
Michael's (24 February), and my nephew Isaac's (26 February), all born within less than a
two-week span (in different years, naturally). Something about '4' also feels significant:
Michael's bday is the 24th of this month, I'm the 4th of March, and Ben is April 4th (my
good friend Monique's bday is February 4th). I remember packing my bag for the hospital
on my birthday in 1995, thinking Ben might arrive two weeks before his due date. Turns
out he was two weeks late, had to be induced, and didn't arrive for a full month, while
my hospital bag sat in the corner. On the night he was born, we were shocked to see out
the window, perhaps a quarter of a mile from the hospital, a large, fiery burning disk. A
burning bush? An omen surrounding Ben's birth? Come to find out (as they say in these
parts) that the conflagration likely resulted from an act of arson committed by one of the
sons of Jerry Sandusky, convicted child molester and former PSU football coach. Strange
convergences...
                    
How two Pisceans (Michael and I) ever raised an Aries son like Ben (confident leader,
determined, sometimes stubborn) is a mystery to me. However, Michael is *not at all* a
typical Pisces, unlike me (dreamy, creative, artsy, intuitive, mystical, spiritual etc.) and
must have his sun in a sign like Aries or Capricorn. I recently found out myself that my
sun is in Capricorn too, tempering my penchant for 'flowery thoughts' (as a social
scientist colleague once joked about me) with a highly tenacious, ambitious core. More
astrological musings another time.... :)",5,sadness,0.73691785,0.014521282,0.01629241,0.16408464,0.008062762,0.051175345,0.73691785,0.008945692
342,"Health update: I haven't felt bad since my last chemo infusion on 17 February. That is,
nothing acute (e.g. intestinal blockage, severe headache, clot etc.) has made its
presence known (but could any time, of course). Reason enough to be thankful. Tumors
in my lower abdomen make standing (or sitting, for that matter) for more than an hour
or two difficult - and painful. Fatigue fluctuates: some days I have to lie right back down
on the couch after breakfast, others I can make it through the day without a rest, take
care of business/work at my desk, run errands, visit with friends. Tomorrow I will meet
with Dr. Patel; I want to know how he sees the next few months unfolding, when he
thinks I should next have a CT-scan to see how my cancer is faring on the new line of
chemo etc. This Friday I have chemo + a two-hour magnesium infusion. Next Monday I'll
see my palliative care doctor and then undergo a routine brain MRI, which I'll then
discuss with Dr. Patel 'jeune,' my radiation oncologist, next Thursday. I am most anxious
about the MRI. Are there new metastases in my brain? Is the slight discomfort I feel at
night when my head presses into the pillow at certain angles 'something' - or nothing?
And if it's 'something,' what's the plan? Of course lying completely immobile for 45
minutes in a tube, agitated by the sound of violent jackhammering, is disconcerting and
stressful (time to practice the meditation techniques I picked up at the spa in Miami!).
The current treatment goal, to reiterate, is to contain my cancer and its spread. In the
best case scenario, perhaps we'll see some shrinkage of tumors and cancerous areas.
Any thought of 'cure' is off the table. In fact, I haven't received any good news on that
front (remission etc.) in about three years! Still, I soldier on. Living one day at a time,
while quite difficult, has proven the most effective strategy for staying in the now.
I attribute my feeling no worse the past two weeks, and in fact mostly relatively ok, to
Ben's presence and to seeing and hearing from so many friends around my birthday.
Plus, the fabulous vibe of the Miami trip has lingered.
I was glad to lift a glass to my son at my birthday party and declare, ""Ben makes
everything better."" I loved stumbling out of my bedroom every morning for the two
weeks he was here and having him come downstairs from his bedroom/workspace to
exchange a quick hug and greeting. He helped me out around the house, cleaned up
after the party, cooked me dinner (shakshuka), ran errands for me, brought me tea,
pitched in to advance my downsizing efforts -- all quite willingly! What we especially
enjoy doing together: a) cooking; b) watching the Knicks; c)collaborating on the NYTimes
Spelling Bee; d) hanging out. Ben also treated me to a cocktail at Pine Grove Hall, a local
place that is ambitious about its food (sometimes more successfully than others) and
libations. The place has two fantastic bartenders who mix serious drinks: they scoff at
anything overly sweet but do wonders with hard liquor+++. Sc'Eric concocted a drink for
me (on the spot) that featured applejack, crème de cacao, a few other ingredients,
within a salted rim. Very yummy.
                    
Ben's doing well, and will soon be off to Vienna to ski with Sammi somewhere in Austria.
In early April, the two of them will return to NY together, as Sammi's year working at the
IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) will have come to a close. I'll be relieved
when both of them are back in the States.
The best things about birthdays, in no particular order: BUTTERCREAM. All the Facebook
messages, texts, cards, phone calls, DMs, bouquets, and emails, and the happy
adrenaline 'ping' each one brings. Being remembered. Spending time with loved ones.
Getting dressed up. This year, four gorgeous floral arrangements from Daniel Vaughn
(wonderful local florist) sent by special people. Parties!
When I was little, my mother arranged lovely birthday parties for me (with my younger
brother Ethan in attendance). We played games (pin the tail on the donkey, musical
chairs). I always had a cake from the Gramercy Park Pastry Shop, adorned with figurines
(usually ballerinas, maybe circus figures; boys' cakes, in those gendered to the max and
generally unwoke days, featured a baseball team or cowboys and Indians....) and
covered in BUTTERCREAM. In the late 60s (?) I had a paper dress party; often on a 'flower
power' theme, those mini-dresses were all the rage. Another year, when I was perhaps
11 to 13, my friends Eva and Zia gave me makeup! I was enthralled. Mary Quant (her
vibe was London's Carnaby Street, flower power, Twiggy, swinging 60s, cosmetics in
bold, daring purple and red) and Yardley. I remember a sticky orangey lip gloss in a
white plastic container. I felt so grown up! I've spent many birthdays in France, at least
two with student groups I was leading. One year (sans students) brought brilliant
sunshine but also wind and a bit of a chill; I took the day off and spent it gallivanting all
over Paris by myself, treating myself to lunch, chocolates, tea and a lemon tart - and
other indulgences. 
My party guests this year were eager to gab, meet people they didn't know, dance (a
conga line!), and direct their healthy appetites to a 'well-curated' (thanks, Deb, for that
description) selection of charcuterie, olives, pâté/cornichons, gougères, fruit salad, Italian
cookies from Veneiro's bakery in New York, and a spectacular cake -- chocolate layers
with mocha BUTTERCREAM, covered with BUTTERCREAM flowers and, as a nod to one of
my signature emblems, gold foil gingko leaves. And a teal cancer ribbon in fondant.
Veuve Clicquot, wine, and Negronis (which I love) mixed by a friend who has a way with
cocktails.
I am one lucky girl.
Let me die in a vat of BUTTERCREAM.
Someone conjectured that this birthday might be 'poignant' for me. Of course, I had the
passing thought: ""What if this is my last?"" Well, then I will have gone out like the
Montmartre revelers I wrote about a while back, carpe diem-ing, kicking their heels up in
                    
the clouds. Or I could be that proverbial ""they gave her a year but she lived for five""
person that we've all met or heard about.  Who knows? Again, living in the now means
not dwelling on the future when it's unnecessary. On my birth day, I felt energized by the
presence of friends and had a great time; I hunger for more days like this. But for now,
eat, drink, and be merry..... And eat the BUTTERCREAM first!

343,"Back to the mood swings after the uplift of Ben's visit and much birthday cheer. But
that's just how we roll these days.
Had my regular check-up/check-in with Dr. Patel this past Monday. For the first time
ever, he asked whether I 'had my affairs in order.' I understand that this is a reasonable,
pro forma question to ask someone whose cancer is both advanced and metastatic, but
still, for some reason, it threw me. While Dr. Beavis has been the self-described
'quarterback,' with a clear sense of the layout of the entire field, Dr. Patel has always
been my 'kick the can' guy. For Beavis, the best case scenario in terms of survival would
bring me to Baltimore, alive and kicking, for an annual checkup this December; for Patel,
it's always been: ""Here's the problem, here's how we're going to treat it."" I had never
before heard him mentioning anything pertaining to an 'end game,' projected lifespan
(he won't go there), etc. Before now. Of course, he was simply doing 'due diligence' as
an oncologist, and also acknowledging that some folks simply can't face this task of
'tying up,' but need to for all the reasons. Still, not easy to hear.
He also told me not to be disappointed by the results of the next CT scan, to occur in
roughly 3-6 weeks, I believe. I've had so many lines of chemo that the cancer cells have
become very adept at mutating in order to not be targeted by the successive lines of
treatment.
Finally, I *think* I understood him to say, in response to a question I had, that at this
point an acute incident might become more likely as my disease is now more advanced.
I need to verify this: occasionally I miss a word or two of his due to his heavy Indian
accent and rapid-fire talk, but it's really just as likely (if not more so) that I was filtering
the info I was receiving. So now of course I'm nervous about being struck unexpectedly
by an acute event: intestinal blockage; double vision; migraine headaches, stroke. My
thoughts careen and I need to reel them in, stay in the moment (a mantra: ""This is the
day I've been given. How do I wish to best use it?"").
The mystery: I look good, as I'm often told, and manage to accomplish a decent amount.
I'm worried that things may become significantly harder, though.
Had chemo on Friday - second infusion of Avastin + Alimta plus two-hour magnesium
infusion. Quite tolerable. However, I did not sleep *one wink* the preceding night; I'm not
sure why my sleeplessness was so very extreme. It wasn't all unpleasant: I revisited my
middle school/high school years, with a vivid, extended focus on some of my wonderful
teachers. Mainly women, they were totally invested in our education (I remembered this
as I was going through and finally discarding many of my old school notebooks). They
were smart, serious, and many of them happened to wear dark rectangular glasses that
made them look particularly intellectual. They also formed, I realized, a fascinating
                    
émigré community within our school: our dance teacher, Anita Zahn, a former student of
Isadora Duncan's sister, hailed from Germany; she lived in an apartment she rented out
in the hotel my grandmother owned, the Wales, across Madison Avenue on 92nd street;
Madame Tatiana Bouteneff, a tall, slightly haughty yet jovial French teacher, was born in
France to an aristocratic White Russian family, the Troubetzkoys; our wonderful, free-
spirited art teacher, Miss Basilevsky ('Miss Basi') was also (White) Russian; our stern,
rigorous Latin teacher, Miss von Heereman, had been, I believe, a member of the Dutch
Resistance during WWII (perhaps one of my NBS classmates can flesh this out a bit); our
History teacher, Mrs. Gordon, was French, the daughter of Edouard Morot-Sir, French
cultural counselor in New York. And another beloved, fiercely smart French teacher,
Madame Schless, about whom I now read in a NYTimes obituary:  ""Edmee de M. Schless
of New Canaan, CT, and Lectoure, France, died peacefully of natural causes. Born
December 28, 1921, in Paris, as the third of nine children of the Count and Countess
Boula de Mareuil, she led a privileged life until the onset of World War II. Her older
brother, Camille, was an organizer of the Normandy resistance who was captured early
in the War. His notoriety forced the rest of the family to disperse and added to the
struggle and hardship that Edmée experienced during the War as she raised her two
youngest siblings."" Madame Schless' brother's story is fascinating and tragic (if you wish
to know more, and read French: https://www.wikimanche.fr/Camille_Boula_de_Mareuil). I
wish I had known more about these intrepid expat women at the time.  Someone must
really write about them. Anyway, it was a night of mental meanderings, which left me
pretty tired for chemo, but I'm back on track with sleep now.
I also met with my lawyer and talked through some modifications I am making to my will.
This too left me stressed as I thought about the many details I still need to attend to. I
was able to go through just a few of these with Michael as he was driving me to chemo
yesterday and need to catch with Ben too. Death and taxes: dealing with both of these at
once right now. Yes, both are inevitable!
Brain MRI scheduled for tomorrow. I'm nervous. Thankfully, the past three months I've
avoided the telltale headaches that have tipped me off to likely brain mets in the past.
But I intuit there may still be 'stuff' going on, and how (or whether) we decide to treat it
is unclear. I'll discuss the results Friday with Dr. Patel the younger. If the results look
good, I am hungering (literally) for a trip to Paris, which Dr. Patel the elder seems to
support, as soon as possible after I know the scan results (I know this wouldn't
necessarily please Dr. Beavis...). I badly want to see my friends there, sit in favorite
spots and *feel* why they make me happy, shop on the rue des Francs-Bourgeois and at
Anne Elisabeth and La Petite Tonkinoise, and taste test tartes au citron all around town. I
want to immerse myself in the smells, sounds, and tastes of the marché d'Aligre. If I
have the energy, I'd love to view the new Sarah Bernhardt exhibit at the Petit Palais.
Wanna join me? Of course, this trip is a huge IF at this point, but it's fun to think about,
and who knows?... And maybe a few days in the city soon too, but again it all hangs in
the balance until Friday at least.
                    
I feel I must double down on asserting my dislike for martial metaphors  in discussion of
serious/terminal illness (I was likely thinking about this at about 4 a.m. during my
sleepless night). Americans love winners (a generalization, I know). Ergo, 'winning the
battle,' or even fighting it valiantly etc., is praiseworthy. By implication, is the person
who 'loses the battle' a loser? Further, how do I construe my decision to kill off many of
my healthy cells (which might be construed as 'losing') in order to destroy even more
cancer cells? A Pyrrhic victory at best. My mind, emotions, and spirit, of course, are
doing everything imaginable to will my survival, but my body may simply not be able to
follow suit.
Having cancer is an experience.
Being a mother is an experience.
Going to graduate school was an experience.
Being a teen in New York in the 1970s was an experience.
Being a married woman was an experience.
Attending high school, attending college were experiences.
Living abroad was an experience; my travels, collectively, constitute an experience.
Like all the experiences mentioned above, my cancer journey is a longer-term
experience (to be distinguished from the many other types of experiences we can have).
Like the aforementioned experiences, having cancer features its own cast of characters,
evokes widely ranging emotions, conjures memorable moments and bleak ones, teaches
me. While the winner/loser trope does not resonate with me in the slightest (I think I'm
simply doing what most of us would do if we want to live, to thrive), the 'experience' idea
meshes nicely with my current beliefs. So let's just skip the whole 'fighting the battle,'
'winning/losing the war' etc. thing, ok?
Memorable moments this week: catching up with my high school friend Jane on Zoom; I
have an open invitation to visit her in Hawaii and it is tempting! A wonderful dinner with
friends last night -- delicious food and drink, lively conversation, warmth and
camaraderie.  Tea and cake at my house today with my friend Jackie, a wise woman and
compassionate friend (the cake I made was Namoura, a Middle Eastern semolina cake
aerated with yogurt and baking soda, soaked in a sugar, lemon and rosewater syrup, and
sprinkled with almonds and crushed pistachios).The two young women who come over
every day for an hour or two to help keep things running smoothly for me are
*godsends.*
                    
Recent reads/viewings: Toni Morrison's _Beloved_ (why on earth had I not read this
masterpiece sooner?). Then saw the movie version with Oprah and Danny Glover (not
bad but nearly impossible to capture the narrative inventiveness and language of the
novel).  Joan Didion's _Blue Nights,_ a sort of pendant to _The Year of Magical Thinking_
(both very moving). _The Banshees of Inisherin_ (good acting and evocative
cinematography; also, great sweaters. Oscar worthy, though?)",2,fear,0.85306126,0.004773413,0.0034550012,0.85306126,0.0064783725,0.09535326,0.0092675,0.02761119
344,"""I woke last night to the sound of thunder/
How far off, I sat and wondered.""
This lyric from my high school years pairs well with my dream or reverie of a few
days/nights ago: I could hear/feel thunder rumble, but didn't know how far it was from
me. It felt ominous.
Sooo.... it was a bit of a medical-centric week. Monday I met with my palliative care
doctor, Dr. Vithalani. We talked a bit about my getting a medical alert system for home.
There wasn't too much of substance to talk about at this point, although I like and
appreciate her (although, to be honest, I think she needs to become more
knowledgeable about the types of cancers her patients are contending with). From there
I drove to the hospital for my brain MRI (with a pit stop en route to enjoy an Otto's root
beer float with mocha chip!). The actual procedure, which I've now undergone many
times, went quite smoothly. I was tired, so I just relaxed to the point of dozing, zoning
out the clanging and loud humming assaulting my head.
Tuesday, my mother underwent what was supposed to be an outpatient procedure to
regularize her heartbeat. From my brother's texts throughout the day, it sounded like a
stressful experience: my mother had to wait several hours for the procedure and felt
quite shaky afterwards, which resulted in her spending the night in the hospital. Of
course, I was concerned about this, but now my mom is home and feeling a bit better
each day. Her doctor will tweak her heart medications to bring her blood pressure, heart
rate etc. under control. Ethan's well-earned reputation as a mensch extraordinaire (a
great example to his nephew Ben, I must say, and undoubtedly to Ethan's own kids too)
did not falter throughout my mother's several days of travails (which could have been
worse, of course): when I called my mother after she returned home, Ethan was in the
kitchen cooking his yummy chicken soup!
Thursday I was at the hair salon. My hair continues to grow back and looks fairly decent
(although it's so short that when I wake up it tends to stick straight up, making me look
like Bello the Clown). Pic attached.
As I hadn't received the radiologist's report on my MRI by Thursday, I called and
requested that it be posted to my Mount Nittany Medical Center Portal. I didn't read it
until Friday, though, before my appointment with the radiation oncologist. Not quite
knowing what to expect (I knew, for example, that I hadn't had any severe headaches,
double vision, or loss of sensation in extremities for at least three months), I was
heartened by the sentence ""No new areas of enhancement identified to suggest
progressive metastatic disease"" and by the radiologist's ""impression: Overall, stable to
decrease in size."" The less good news is that, in going over the images with a fine tooth
                    
comb, Dr. Patel the younger identified four tiny (1-2 mm) spots that were there before
but that have increased very slightly in size. He said we could wait three months to treat
them (after another MRI) -- essentially kicking the can -- or we could radiate them. It all
depends on my goals: do I want to treat every bit of cancer we safely can if it might
prolong my life and ensure the quality of it or do I simply not want to be bothered with
committing to five more rounds of radiation, having that awful mask made again, etc.
And I do wonder about $ too with the changes to our PSU insurance policy. I will likely go
for more radiation, which he said there is no rush to perform (I could wait up to six
weeks, potentially). The two Drs. Patel spoke; the elder told the younger (as the younger
reported to me) that I ""look good"" and could definitely manage more radiation at this
point. In any event, Dr. Patel (who I've come to like; he's kind, but a straight shooter)
does not consider this a 'bad' report, rather one that shows ""subtle progression,"" in his
words. There are no new spots. The spots we radiated last time are gone. It could be
worse.
From there, I went straight to the ER (merely to the front entrance of the hospital as the
cancer center is located at its rear), a visit that was somewhat more vexing. I was hoping
they would scan my side/abdomen/stomach etc. to see if they could assess what was
causing my discomfort in those areas, and that's exactly what they did. There were long
waits for everything, of course, but overall I found the care perfectly competent, which
has not always been my experience at Mt. Nittany (including when Ben was born there). I
was fairly certain that the nice young doctor, Dr. Burton, was the same one who had first
detected my cancer on a dreary Easter Sunday in 2019, when I had come to the ER
because of severe constipation (due to lesions on my colon, I found out). I remember Dr.
Burton seeming shaken when he had reviewed that first CT-scan in 2019, because so
much cancer was present (I had shut down from shock). In any event, this time Dr.
Burton went through his records and confirmed that he was indeed the very same
doctor! I told him that I had had a good four years since he had seen me, and he was
very warm. I also could have sworn that the technician guiding me through the CT-scan
on Friday was the same one as in 2019, the one who had asked me, somewhat
ominously, I felt, ""how long have you had this problem?"" and who had wished me ""good
luck"" - sinisterly, it seemed to me, as I was being wheeled out of the scan room. This
time, I simply asked him how long he had been at the hospital and he responded twelve
years. Definitely a PTSD moment. And as my friend Andrew noted wisely, commenting on
a previous post, my assumption that this technician had 'secret knowledge' that gave
him some sort of power over me felt very scary. So much for that trip down memory
lane, lol.
Enfin -- the CT scan did not reveal an infection, nor a kidney stone (due to some blood in
my urine and discomfort/pain on my flank), nor anything of that nature. However, it did
show progression of my cancer, revealing a new spot on my liver and a spot on my lung.
The doctor felt this could be causing my discomfort, given where it is localized (although
Dr. Vithalani or someone told me that I was unlikely to feel pain from cancer on my
                    
liver). Obviously, this is not great news, although not unexpected. The metastases,
though, make me quite nervous.
I was so exhausted from my day at the hospital, and the stress induced, that I went to
bed at 10 p.m. Friday and slept until 4 p.m. the next day! I had been given morphine at
the hospital, which lifted my pain and relaxed me, but on coming off it I was really wiped.
At 4 p.m. I heard someone knock on my door and then enter my house. It was Michael;
Ben had been worried that he hadn't been able to get in touch with me and was worried
(Michael was pretty sure I was sleeping; his intuitions on these things are usually quite
sensible). Unfortunately, my iPhone settings had also changed during the night,
preventing my seeing notifications of phone messages in the usual manner. I texted and
called Ben immediately as well as others who had been nice enough to check in. 
Voilà.
Current mood: very pissed off thinking about all the things I wanted to do (a list maybe
for another time) and all my goals that I will likely not be able to accomplish.
To improve my mood, I think I'll go to NY this week, provided I feel up to it. I want to
check on my mother and help her if I can, see family and friends as my energy permits
(also frustrated that I definitely have the *will* but am somewhat limited in what I can
do; Uber is my friend). On the other hand, as in my experience get-togethers with friends
have tended to energize me (as does my city), it's possible that this will hold true next
week.
Random stuff:
Re my last post: for my NBS pals: Miss von Heereman had not been a member of the
Dutch Resistance. She was born in Silesia, a German-speaking part of Poland, to an
aristocratic family and educated by private tutors, one a priest who taught her Latin. She
left Silesia via Switzerland because of the political situation, seemingly an allusion to the
rise of Nazism (per an NBS publication). So yes, I regret I won't have time to write a
book, or at least an article, about these fascinating expat women who educated us!
Reading: _The Remains of the Day,_ Kazuo Ishiguro. Oh my, what a novel.
I know that out of caring some of you wanted to get news of my MRI results as soon as
they became available. I appreciate your concern but please understand that I have to
do this on my own time. It's not that I want to withhold information but sometimes I have
a lot to process. I need to ensure that I have time to do this before sharing news with
anyone outside my family.
Not a whole lot of 'fun' this weekend, but I'm going to visit my friend Maria in her new
house later.

345,"It's been a minute. Apologies.
A rough day Friday the 17th, as recounted in my last post -- identification of four tiny
cancerous spots in my brain, to be radiated soon, followed immediately by an ER visit
that revealed via CT-scan progression of my cancer, w/additional liver and lung mets --
sent me (after I *crashed* for eighteen hours of sleep) into a panicked, desperate mode;
I felt I needed to go into overdrive to get 'everything' done within an ever-shrinking time
frame. When I calmed down, I simply decided that I needed to get away ('flight'
response?), needed a change of scene, of ideas. And I wanted to see my mother, who
recently underwent a heart procedure. So last Tuesday I got on the train to New York.
Time with old friends + family + favorite taste treats + the city both energizes and
relaxes me. It's a non-chemical mood enhancer and remedy. I needed it, and frankly,
sometimes I need to be in denial, to not think about my health challenges. At the same
time, while I did push myself a bit, I also made necessary adjustments (Ubers and buses
instead of the subway; get-togethers mainly near my mother's apartment, where I was
staying). I arranged ahead of time to see four of my oldest and dearest friends, two from
grade school -- Jill, with whom I traveled to Paris last May, and Zia -- and two from grad
school -- Isabelle (we shared thin-crust pizza, giggles and bubbles at Posto on 18th st.)
and Shanny (tea near Rock Center). One thing I love about these get-togethers is that
*there is always so much to talk about* because these friendships have such strong
foundations and long histories. And it just feels so great to spend time together, enjoying
each other's company: ""Parce que c'était [elle], parce que c'était moi"" (pace Montaigne).
My brother Ethan and I caught up over an Indian thali platter in 'Curry Hill,' then shopped
at international foods mecca, Kalustyan (I bought their store-made hummus, labne with
fig jam, and a small piece of halvah); it felt warming and familiar to hang out with my
brother and indulge in foodie activities in a corner of the city we grew up in. I also caught
Ben for dinner on the eve of his departure to Vienna to meet up with Sammi. They're in
Lisbon right now and will come home together on April 8th, at the conclusion of Sammi's
year in Vienna (I will be *so* happy when these two are back on US soil). After dinner
(ramen/sushi, mediocre) we visited with my mother for a while. Mom, Arnold and I also
had dinner at my mother's one night; Arnold, at 97, is off on a trip to the World War II
museum in New Orleans. He's amazing! Also loved taking in the smells and sights of
early spring both at the large Greenmarket in Union Square and along E. 17th st. near
Rutherford Place, where blooming magnolia trees looked lovely against a row of 19th
century brownstones topped with miniature figures of jockeys! Did some minor shopping
-- Sephora for shimmery eye shadow, Breads Bakery for babka (which I gifted a friend)
and one of their superior egg salad sandwiches. 
My mother's recent, usually outpatient, heart procedure to correct a-fib did not go
entirely as smoothly as expected (she wound up in the hospital overnight). She's home
                    
and stable (has been going out in the neighborhood etc.) but still lacks energy in the
morning. I tried to help out as much as  I could -- cooked asparagus soup, ran errands,
accompanied her to an urgent care clinic one morning (she feels better now) -- and was
glad for the time I was able to spend with her. She'll have a telehealth appointment with
her cardiologist on Friday.
Back in PA, more uncertainty and anxiety. I was at the radiation oncologist's yesterday
for the CT-scan that Dr. Patel the younger will use to pinpoint the cancerous spots he will
then zap. I also had made, for the third time, that hideous Darth Vader mask that will be
used to bolt me down to the table; nothing like having warm plastic molded around your
face while you clamp down on a bit pushed into your mouth. But really, the brain
radiation is the least of my worries right now!
Drs. Beavis and Patel want to stop my current course of chemo (Avastin/Alimta) because
it's not working (as the CT-scan from the ER clearly indicated). So, no chemo this week.
Dr. Beavis is willing to try - as a final option (?) - a new chemo drug just authorized by
the FDA last December, called Elahere. It's so new that Dr. Patel senior has never
administered it. It works a bit differently from my previous chemo drugs (I forget how;
will need to look at Dr. Beavis' email). Dr. Beavis tested it on my tumor (of which they've
kept a sample at Hopkins!) and was glad to see that I have the 'correct' tumor type to be
able to receive Elahere. Questions: can it be obtained and administered in State College?
Will insurance cover it? How will I tolerate it? Dr. Patel's nurse emailed me yesterday and
suggested that perhaps I would start treatment w/Elahere at Hopkins because it may
take a while for my Geisinger facility to obtain it. I'll see Dr. Patel on Friday and will have
many questions for him.
Then there is the question of side effects. From my (granted brief, initial) reading about
Elahere, I have learned that a potential side effect is severe ocular degeneration. Dr.
Patel's nurse therefore informed me that my ophthalmologist would need to be on board
and I'd have to visit him frequently to receive doses of steroid eye drops under his
supervision. Oh my. Between Scylla and Charybdis: do I stop all treatment now,
hastening my demise, or try Elahere and risk impairing my vision, which provides me
with most of the agency I enjoy now (driving, walking, reading, writing, cooking etc.
etc.)? Need to find out more on Friday.
A few nights ago, I found myself again spinning towards panic and desperation and said
out loud, to no one in particular: ""I'm scared."" The next day I got a grip.
Physically, I'm feeling so-so. I have discomfort on my side that may be attributable to the
cancer in my liver. A heating pad helps. Clearly, my cancer is becoming more perilous
these days.
                    
In a suggestive article in the NYTimes today, written by a palliative doctor, I read this: 
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/opinion/how-to-accept-death.html
""Reconsidering what we think acceptance means — and whether it will come to pass — requires loosening our
expectations of those who are dying. To become better at talking to one another honestly about death and to
truly prepare for it, we must first understand why we expect the dying to demonstrate readiness in the first
place.""
In regard to what I wrote in another post about historical conceptions of ""a good death,"" this doctor posits that
there is really no 'right way' to die, and that notions of 'acceptance,' death bed confessions, last-minute patching-
up of conflicts, etc., are -- like the martial metaphors applied to death that I've been railing against - ways for
some people to keep death at a distance, to fit it into a neat box and to deny its right to 'messiness,' to defying of
categorization.
This article resonated with me and in some way relieved me of the 'pressure' to have a 'good death' or even to
accept death. I realize I've been mouthing a narrative of acceptance -- perhaps simply to keep myself from going
off the deep end -- but not entirely buying into it. At the current moment, I'm finding it obscene and entirely
unacceptable that a vibrant sixty-four-year old woman with so many goals for her future and who savors life so
much should have to die. But then again, my moods and thoughts can change like quicksilver.
I took a peaceful country drive the morning after I returned from the city, another non-chemical antidote, this
one to the densely-packed streets and quick pace of New York. The sight of clotheslines fluttering in the breeze
on Amish farms; cows, horses, and sheep peacefully grazing; a buggy or two rolling by; the earth readying to
yield its first crops (maybe asparagus, spring onions, and rhubarb?) was a natural calmant.
And was happy to join three friends for dinner last night at Allen Street Grill, and look forward to having
breakfast tomorrow with my friend (and college classmate, and former State College resident) Heather, after
several years. And Passover is next week! A celebration of renewal and freedom!
P.S. More NY pictures to follow
P.P.S. Please know that I would really have liked to have seen other friends in the city, too. I am sorry that I did
not have more time and physical wherewithal to do so.

346,"Again, it's been a minute. Much going on. But that's how we roll.
On the 31st, I had an appointment with Dr. Patel. Dr. Beavis had sent him information
about Elahere and I could tell that his staff (Kayla, his lead nurse; the nurses in the
infusion room; Dr. Patel) were motivated to educate themselves about this new (for
them, as only recently FDA-approved) drug and to gear up for the first infusion. I had
already pretty much come around to moving ahead with Elahere (what's the
alternative??), but remain nervous due to potential side effects, notably the ocular
toxicity (visual impairment, corneal damage, pain behind the eyes) that occurs in 60% of
the cases, according to one study I read (this damage reverses itself in about half the
cases, but if it doesn't?...). I will use two types of eyedrops (one a steroid) regularly,
beginning right before the first infusion. There are other unsavory potential side effects
too: neuropathy, GI issues, bone pain, fatigue and nausea etc. But I will try to move
forward 'courageously,' as Dr. Patel encourages me to do. He seems ready for this new
challenge, and that heartened me, too. Elahere has about a 30% effectiveness rate,
again according to a study I read. As a a folate receptor alpha directed antibody and microtubule
inhibitor conjugate (can some scientist remind me what this means?), it acts differently than the previous
chemo drugs I've been treated with. From what I understand, it is much more 'targeted,' affixing itself directly
to cancer cells rather than being released diffusely into the blood stream.  In any event, I'm scheduled
to have my first infusion this coming Friday provided the medication arrives in time. If it
doesn't, the infusion will need to be rescheduled for the following week. I should be able
to have all the infusions here and not at Hopkins, because it turns out we are able to get
the medication here soon. And we received word from Highmark that the cost will be
covered (yay!), although I don't know what the copay will be. Hopefully reasonable.
I also joined an online discussion group exclusively for women on Elahere; it's proving
fairly helpful.
Dr. Patel and I also discussed the significant persistent discomfort I'm having on my right
side, the issue that sent me to the ER a few weeks ago. He believes it is due to cancer in
the pleura (lining/coating of the lung). A heat pad helps, but damn it's uncomfortable and
I pray that Elahere can target some of the cancer there. In the meantime, the usual:
Tylenol, Oxycodone.
Then it was off to the eye doctor this past Tuesday to have my eyes checked. I was
happy to learn that my optometrist, Dr. Nelson, has been getting herself up to speed
about Elahere too (for subsequent visits, every three weeks, we agreed that I would see
the ophthalmologist in the group, Dr. Marcovich). Dr. Nelson's eye exam revealed a fairly
significant worsening of the vision in my left eye, which I had also detected, likely due to
the cataracts we had discussed at my last visit in January. ""The next step is cataract
surgery,"" she said. Oy gevalt! On top of everything! We agreed, though, that we'd wait
                    
to see what kind of damage Elahere does (or doesn't) before further discussing cataract
surgery.
Five sessions of brain radiation are also coming up. I expect a call early this week to set
them up, hopefully for this week and next.
I do wonder how much further the cancer can progress before it really begins to
incapacitate me.
Well, let's get on with it.
Despite this (bleak? overwhelming? how does it seem to you?) account of the upcoming
treatment plan, all in all I've been in pretty good spirits recently and have enjoyed some
lovely moments with friends: a really good talk with a friend (two, actually) currently
confronting health challenges due to disease. I feel a deep kinship with these friends,
almost as if they're the only ones who can truly understand what I'm experiencing
(physically, emotionally, psychologically); lovely Sunday dinner at my friends' Maria and
Greg's new condo, complete with 'Mama Rose's' (Maria's mom's) lasagna and meatballs
and Italian sausage in red sauce. A lively pre-Easter dinner party at friends' last night, a
couple of curly-headed boy toddlers running about (adorable!); fabulous food, featuring
some of the Mexican dishes my (Mexican-born) friend/colleague excels at: ceviche,
guacamole, salsa macha (a discovery). Glazed pork roasts that John scouted out in
""Trump country"" (i.e. from a butcher way out in the boonies, although not too far from
here, who had just slaughtered the pig!). And lots of texts, emails and zooms with dear
ones. And Ben (who turned twenty-eight on the 4th) and Sammi (whose birthday is
upcoming in early May) are home from Europe! They had a great time visiting Lisbon,
skiing in the Tyrol, and hanging out in Vienna as Sammi finished up her stay there. They
tentatively plan to visit for Mother's Day and stay for a while. Other visits on the horizon
as well.
I want to report on Passover in another blog post. And also - in yet another post? - to
remember the Easter Sunday four years ago when a young ER doc at our local Mount
Nittany Medical Center, visibly shaken, conveyed to me that CT-scan imaging had
revealed sizeable masses in my pelvic and abdominal areas. The promise of 'redemption'
that Easter holds out seemed like a bad joke to me that day, and I am grateful to have
spent this sunny Easter Sunday relaxing, although not discomfort-free.

348,"Tomorrow beginning at 9 a.m. I'm having my first infusion of Elahere. While normally
that drug is infused for only thirty minutes, Dr. Patel has booked six hours for this first
treatment, between premeds (Benadryl, Zofran, Tylenol etc.), a titrated infusion of
Elahere, postmeds, and then a two-hour infusion of magnesium as my level remains
chronically low. In preparation for tomorrow, I've begun taking the two prescribed eye
drops, one a steroid, the other artificial tears. As I was instructed to give myself the
steroid drops every four hours, I had to jolt myself out of a deep sleep at 2 and 6 a.m. I
have to rinse and repeat for about a week, while also lubricating with artificial tears at
least four times a day. Today I feel foggy... although sitting in the sun (an unseasonable
84 degrees!) at lunch with my friend Kathryn felt relaxing. A FB page I joined for women
on Elahere is pushing the consensus many of them came to individually: take the steroid
eye drops during waking hours so as not to compromise sleep. I'd *love* this, but need
to check w/Dr. Patel first. If I can handle having my lung drained at 4 a.m., giving myself
injections for many months, draining fluid from my stomach area into bags dangling from
my body (also for many months), being life flighted to Hopkins, surviving a thirteen-hour
debulking surgery, a nine-hour fistula repair, and removal of a brain tumor....well then, I
can probably handle feeling groggy for a week every three weeks.
I simply don't want to leave the party.
I'll stay on Elahere (once every three weeks) until a)it proves ineffective (tbd via CT-scan,
I'm not sure when) or b)I cannot tolerate the drug.
And my next round of brain radiation begins next Tuesday: five sessions spread over the
next two weeks. If these treatments proceed as they did the first two times the side
effects were minimal. I remember some fatigue but that's about it. We are treating four
(I believe) very small (1-2 mm) cancerous spots, not tumors, so the effects should
normally be proportionally less disruptive and fewer.
I'm *marginally* more hopeful about Elahere as it belongs to a new class of drugs, more
targeted than their predecessors. But I have a lot of cancer in me. But there may be
scary side effects. Heading into year five of treatment while my disease has continued to
progress, I will only say  for now: ""we'll see."" Damn that pernicious, aggressive
carcinoma sarcoma that started it all.

Mary Quant has died! As much of the late-1960s 'swinging sixties,' hippie and 'mod'
cultures trickled down to me and my friends when were in our early teens, I remember
our being enthralled by Mary Quant's vivid palette and 'flower power' iconography when
we were just beginning to express our individuality (or, conversely, faddishness) with
                    
clothes and makeup. I could have sworn I boasted some Mary Quant of my own, but
looking back at the info sheet I put together after my thirteenth birthday party in 1972, I
see that, along with incense burners, scented candles, Snoopy stickers, a poster, and
stationery, my friends Eva & Zia gifted me not Mary Quant but the brand that remains
intertwined with Mary's in my mind: Biba! No doubt I loved the plum eyeshadow and
mulberry nail polish that I would attempt to transform into (especially as I headed
towards high school)  a kind of goth (goth before goth), vixen-like, vampy, Stevie Nicks
wannabe look. I also see that Zia and Eva gave me (along with Revlon mascara and
'lemon lotion'), a Yardley Pot o' Gloss, when Yardley also conjured London Mod and lip
gloss was becoming all the rage. As with the genie's bottle, memories of those bygone
late 1960s/early 1970s (a particular source of nostalgia for me, perhaps because
experienced as the gateway to my teens) tumble from my Yardley lip gloss pot and Biba
eye shadow compact.

and support. I would love to thank each person individually but need to prioritize rest
right now. Please know how much I appreciate every kind gesture and thought; I'm a
lucky girl!
All went fine today. The procedure did not differ from what I'm used to: 2-hour
magnesium drip, pre-meds and solution (saline, Benadryl, Tylenol, Decadron, Zofran),
titrated Elahere drip (2 hours?). I spent six hours in the chair (and up and down a bit), ate
some lunch, dozed, sent a few texts. Dr. Patel swung by to see how I was doing; he
indicated that I might shorten the time between each dose of steroid eye drops to enable
me to have a (less) interrupted sleep. having been jolted out of a deep sleep at 2 and 6
a.m. the past two nights has done a real number on my circadian rhythms. My excellent
nurse, Brianne (who feels like a friend by this point), had been prepped extensively on
my treatment and there were no glitches whatsoever. Many thanks to Helen for the ride
to chemo this morning (the opportunity for a quick catch-up!), to Jackie for picking me up
(and swinging by Meyer's Dairy for the ritual post-chemo root beer float), and to Michael,
for bringing me dinner tonight (luscious grilled lamb chops, mashed potatoes and
zucchini). And to my helper Kelsey, who ensured my return to an orderly, neat, and
                    
peaceful home. My new gingko-themed quilt (bien sûr) invited me to take a nap when I
got home, and I just woke up.
I don't expect to encounter side effects today but am prepared to take on whatever
Elahere throws at me in the days ahead. Tonight I'll crash on the couch and relax w/a few
shows that are tempting me (Mrs. Maisel and another I won't mention as it's pure,
addictive junk). :)
Thank you once again. We are interconnected branches of a vine that produces the fruits
we've been sanctifying this time of year. Good shabbos. It's a 'day to walk lightly through
the world.'",3,joy,0.4515065,0.011817856,0.0017047822,0.10420798,0.4515065,0.050837252,0.34246597,0.037459634
350,"Thank you to everyone who's been checking on me this week. I'm hanging in. While
Elahere has not been 'a walk in the park' so far, the side effects have been manageable.
I've only had one day I would qualify as 'bad,' two days after my first infusion: GI issues,
abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, dehydration and fatigue. I couldn't do much more than
rest that day. Abdominal discomfort has continued but is under control; staying hydrated
as best I can and now taking Immodium (and soon, Lomotil). I also started my third
course of brain radiation today (!). Like the first two, it makes for a most uncomfortable
20-30 minutes as I'm literally bolted to the table by a tight plastic head mask (with a
nose hole for breathing, of course, very _Silence of the Lambs;_ speaking of which, a
heavily-guarded prisoner in an orange jumpsuit sat manacled in the waiting room,
awaiting his radiation treatment after mine!). I didn't realize I was so tired from the
radiation-chemo double whammy until I slept away most of the afternoon after I came
home. As hard wired as I am to feel pissed off about being 'unproductive,' I know I need
my 'sleep cure.'
Taking my different medications at the right time(s) (not my forte) is somewhat
challenging, but I'm managing that too. The first five days of my chemo cycle, I was
giving myself steroid eye drops six times a day and artificial tears (at least) four times a
day (it turns out I've been using the wrong type of artificial tears and had to buy new
ones - preservative free - today). After five days, I've dropped to steroid eye drops four
times a day and artificial tears (at least) four times a day. Soon I'll use only artificial tears
until the next infusion. All this involves getting up at least once during the night for the
drops. And there must be at least ten minutes between the two types of drops! On top of
this, I have to take an oral steroid an hour before each radiation session. My head is
spinning. I joined a FB page for Elahere users and it's proved quite helpful. Another
woman and I are basically keeping pace with one another (we had our first infusion on
the same day), and have been updating one another on how we're doing.
The discomfort on my side (pleura/ribs/lung?) has not abated and seems to stretch
around to my back. A heat pad provides relief. What is the end game in terms of this
particular hurt? I'll talk to my oncologist about it this week.
Yes, I'll see Dr. Patel on Friday. His nurse, Kayla, called me today to check on me and
recommend medication for my abdominal discomfort. I was grateful for her call.
All pretty exciting, huh? It's the end of the school year - my favorite time of year when I
was teaching - and I wish I were on campus for the various student awards ceremonies,
dissertation defenses, commencement, and celebratory rituals that helped power us
through all the final grading, tired but happy. And a row of hyacinths (or maybe lilacs?)
along ""Deans' Walk"" on campus perfumes the air divinely in late April. I've nicely been
invited to attend a few defenses via Zoom, will take a favorite student to lunch next
                    
week, and will be on hand to help celebrate an esteemed colleague's (and friend's!)
retirement. So at least I will have a taste of end of year if I can't be more squarely in the
mix.
Will need to try to do something fun this weekend. Get together with friends. Cook or
bake (I am awaiting the first stalks of rhubarb and asparagus with bated...taste buds).
Take a drive. Watch a movie. Look forward to late April/May visitors, including Ben and
Sammi for Mothers Day, and zoom visits with a few friends on the west coast.

351,"Elahere came back to bite me this past weekend, after a week of relatively smooth
sailing. Felt like some devil had gotten into my intestines and was squeezing, twisting,
and pulling. My entire GI system was cramping, rolling waves of intense discomfort (as
opposed to sharp pain). And fatigue. And nausea. And diarrhea. I could barely drag
myself to the couch Saturday and Sunday, where a heating pad numbed some of the
cramping while I steadied myself for the next wave of pain. A cocktail of Trazadone,
Oxycodone and Tylenol PM (ok'd by my doctors) helped me sleep -- for fourteen hours
Friday night. No appetite, have hardly eaten anything in close to four days (and am
about four pounds lighter) but have been keeping hydrated. Tonight I'll have some
Chinese chicken noodle soup; the warm broth is appealing.
Initially, I couldn't figure out the source of my discomfort. Elahere? A stomach or
intestinal blockage? Consequently, I couldn't figure out how to treat it. Antacid?
Immodium? Nothing? Liquid diet? A trip to the ER (which I was seriously considering)? I
decided to query the online chat group for Elahere users that I recently joined. Several
women confirmed that they had experienced the exact same symptoms as I was having.
One said she simply relied on Tylenol to provide relief. Another reported powering
through on Oxycodone. So I experimented with taking some Oxycodone during the day
(and not just 5 mg at night, when I usually take it); that helped. Today I'm feeling
somewhat better but not completely. It's a reminder to me that these symptoms can hit
unexpectedly.
I was in so much physical distress that I questioned whether I was ""fighting to live""
rather than ""living to fight."" My thought was that if this distress continued through the
three cycles of Elahere before CT-scan, I would call it quits at that point. But today I felt a
bit better and I put away that thought.
I was also at the hospital for two radiation treatments this past week (with three more
upcoming this T, Th and Fr). I only experience fatigue from radiation, although three
treatments in one week may be a rough go. Instead of asking to keep tuned to the overly
mellow playlist piped into the radiation room, with Peter, Paul and Mary crooning about
""leaving on a jet plane,"" I requested 70s' r&b and disco! As I was being bolted to the
table, KC and the Sunshine Band were teasing, ""That's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it,
uh huh uh huh."" All I could think was ""This is NOT the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it. I do
NOT like this at all, nuh huh nuh huh!!""
On Friday I met with Dr. Patel to assess how my treatment is going so far. At this point,
he's all about my living my best life: ""Just go, go, go, just do, do, do!"" Even Paris if I feel
up to it, which remains to be seen. The one matter I'm concerned about (he seemed less
so, although he's keeping an eye on it), are two elevated liver markers (ALT and AST),
indicating liver damage. They may be elevated as an effect of the Elahere, the cancer, or
                    
some combination. It's imperative that I keep well hydrated. The thought of liver damage
makes me anxious.
Despite not feeling well, I managed to rally to keep all my weekend plans: a lovely
retirement reception and dinner for a spectacular colleague in English, my friend Cheryl;
a play, _Emilia,_ with my friend Maria, about a female poet of Shakespeare's day, largely
lost to history; and a catch-up visit from my friend Monique. I also made my first batch of
the season of strawberry-rhubarb sauce, and bought raw cream off a farm to serve with
it. My 'rhubarb reconnaissance mission' took place on a glorious April day - fields the
color of limes, early blooms in purple, yellow, and beige -- that had me headed to the
large Belleville Wednesday market (ignore all the awful Trump flags and firearms for
sale! head straight for the rhubarb!) and meandering along back roads. ""Whan that April
with his showres soote...."" I still remember those fifty first lines of the Prologue to _The
Canterbury Tales_ that my schoolmates and I had to memorize, and I'll bet they do too!
I'm very excited for the visit of my grade school friends, Zia and Eva, this weekend.
They'll take Amtrak from New York. We'll open the voluminous archives -- letters,
journals, photos, notes, stories, 'birthday books' and more we've kept and exchanged
over the years -- and revel in this precious circle of life moment.

Amtrak from New York. I am super excited about their visit, which will involve a good
amount of 'hanging' and reminiscing via our abundant personal 'archives' (especially as
rain is predicted all weekend).
                    
I am done with my third course of radiation! Fifteen treatments in all, targeting spots in
my brain. Everything seems to have gone well and I'll have an MRI in three months, for
reimaging. I'm not sensing any cognitive deterioration at all (as mentioned, Dr. Patel the
Younger and the man known only as The Physicist target the spots ultra-precisely so as
not to damage any healthy tissue). As always, I simply feel tired (however, the steroid I
take before the treatment is guaranteed to mess with my sleep tonight, as it did last
night, as it will next Friday night post-chemo). Dr. Patel hopes he won't have to see me
again for more radiation (as do I), but we'll always be keeping an eye on it.
For my musical pleasure during radiation, yesterday I requested all Bob Marley and
today all Handel. I felt Handel would work well on this rainy day (>calming, melodious)
following a night of poor sleep (>rousing and uplifting>_Water Music!_).
I've been lubricating my eyes diligently and hope the next infusion (a week from today)
will not bring about any of the ocular toxicity I've been fearing.
Monday I'll have a long infusion -- two hours of fluids + two hours of magnesium. I'm
glad to be receiving hydration this way as, no matter how much I drink (and I likely could
drink more, although I try!) I still tend to feel dehydrated.
Fun stuff this week: attended via Zoom the (successful) dissertation defense of a student
I worked closely with until I retired; W lunch at India Pavilion with a favorite undergrad,
soon to be a graduate and off to work for a year as a public educator at Neuengamme
concentration camp; beer and quesadillas creekside at Voodoo Lounge with my friend
Ted (who eons ago was my student); cooking (more strawberry-rhubarb sauce; soon:
cream of asparagus soup!).
I seem to be encountering a striking number of folks (in my approximate age range)
dealing with different types of cancers right now. Did we work so hard to be successful in
our careers and parenting that our immune systems were compromised? What is going
on?? I wish every one of them a return to wholeness of body and spirit.

353,"Health update: unfortunately, still hindered by debilitating GI discomfort, a side effect of
Elahere, but trying to stay glued together with Oxycodone and Tylenol. Rest, heat pad
help; had two-hour infusion of fluids on Monday for extra hydration. At the same time,
allowing myself to feel a *smidgen* of hopefulness on seeing a)my magnesium level
climb to almost normal (it's been as low as .9 and as high, this past Monday, as 1.4;
anything 1.5 or above is considered normal and I'd been hovering at 1.2 or 1.3 for
weeks); b)my liver enzyme markers (ALT and AST) plummet (a good thing) where the
previous week they'd been alarmingly high; c)something else that I deem 'tmi' in this
context but that is normally a sign of improved liver/pancreatic health. So tomorrow I'll
start prepping for infusion #2 of Elahere on Friday: lab work; steroid eye drops and
artificial tears 6x/day. Praying my eyes (specifically, my corneas) are not affected;
hoping for no worsening of neuropathy, GI woes etc. For now, I won't create worries.
Update (Thursday): good liver enzyme marker numbers maintained after labs this
morning.

With Mercury appearing, as it does right now, to travel backward across the sky, we
should refrain from embarking on new endeavors, signing contracts, succumbing to
travel mishaps, and over-relying on technology. This much my girlhood friends, Eva and
Zia, and I agreed upon as we revisited our common belief in astrology en route to the
train station in Lewistown. Instead, this may well be a propitious time to look backwards,
take stock, review past errors -- which is exactly what we did during our magical
weekend together.
As became clear over the weekend, both my friends have 'reviewed past errors' over the
decades, whether in their personal, professional, or familial lives-- and conquered them
with accomplishments, mental, physical and emotional grit, courage, clear-sightedness,
and intelligence . It's not been easy. All three of us are confronting health challenges
right now. I think we're pretty badass.
I am so proud of these women.
We were eleven (in 1971) when we met (Eva and Zia had just enrolled in our private
girls' school in NYC and had even had acting roles in a movie, _Savages,_ before that; I
had attended Nightingale since second grade); we soon became the closest of friends. I
must have been drawn to these girls with such interesting heritages (Indian: Zia; German-
Iraqi: Eva). These girls with the larger than life mothers: Zia's is Madhur Jaffrey; my dog-
eared copy of _An Invitation to Indian Cooking_ introduced me (and likely millions of
other Americans) to a spectacular world of tastes, smells, colors, and spices; Eva's mom,
Angelika Saleh, lent her name to the legendary cutting-edge art movie house on Houston
St. 
                    
The anticipated centerpiece of the weekend was a plunge into our pasts, via dozens and
dozens of letters exchanged among Zia, Eva and myself from ages eleven to eighteen
(1971-78), sent from Delhi, Germany, New York, Amherst, MA (where my father taught
summer school one year), Maine, the Hamptons (an au pair gig for Zia), Cambridge, MA.
Missives communicated on every variety of stationery: air letters, cute writing paper
decorated with lemons (and smelling of them too), birds, hearts, flowers (is stationery
even a 'thing,' anymore?); as a teen, I fill up every available cm of paper with my writing,
as I still do! Photos, diaries, and documents -- among them Zia's meticulously prepared
'data sheet' on the science teacher many of us were crushing  on, Mr. Mann, which
conveyed such observations as ""Likes water,"" and detailed our forays to his apartment
building where we got on our bellies in front of his apartment door and tried to
detect...any signs of movement within from the slit on the bottom. The driving rain this
past weekend provided the perfect backdrop for this memory plunge (punctuated by two
delicious dinners featuring Indian shrimp and also cauliflower, thanks to Zia), and we
veered between convulsive laughter (the Mr. Mann document), tears, incredulousness,
and fascination. Was this really us?
Saturday night, I went to bed around 11, leaving Eva and Zia to begin scanning the
letters until 2 a.m.; I awoke the next morning to  find my friends in the exact same spot
in my sunroom, scanning away on just a few hours of sleep! Such an act of love and
remembrance. If I had more time (ie a longer life expectancy), I'd consider drawing on
our archive to craft a longer piece.  My historian's skill set would come in handy but how
to render the emotional charge of all this?
We are constantly self-berating and apologetic: for our 'sloppy' handwriting; for the pen
that is running out of ink, our 'boring' summer, our 'boring' news (Zia: ""Well, don't fall
asleep...;"" Eva from Munich: ""I'm getting really bored here;"" Eva from New York: ""I'm
very bored here, but Zia will be here soon;."" Eva finds her letter to me so boring that ""I
should have told you in the beginning to rip it up.""). Zia claims to be ""getting uglier by
the minute."" Was this a sort of 'trope' of our correspondence or were we really so lacking
in confidence? I worry.
We are touchingly, almost desperately loyal, constantly proclaiming our status as best
friends (Zia: ""I'm so glad you write, for I have never had a more faithful friend;"" ""Always,
let's be friends, of the best kind.""); fretting about what it might 'mean' when
experiencing radio (or rather, epistolary) silence from one of our classmates (""all my so-
called friends are not writing!""), as during the summers in which we were totally
dependent on the mail service for communication; always on guard for 'betrayals' should
one of our classmates turn on us (this did indeed happen, as revealed in a shunning
letter one of the popular girls in our class of twenty-five sent to me and Zia, and perhaps
Eva). In no uncertain terms and in the written equivalent of a scream, she advised us to
""FORGET IT"" (ie having a friendship), since we apparently had placed certain conditions
                    
on this relationship. Mean girls - wow. ""ARE YOU STILL MY BEST FRIEND??""
We are semi-tuned in to current events, the Watergate trials and Nixon's resignation in
August 1974 topping the list --  scandals that Zia, last weekend, correctly deemed
'quaint' by today's standards.
We are precious, precocious, and pretentious (yet in retrospect, impressive!) young
teens. Zia, at fourteen, is reading Hemingway (as am I, apparently: ""you too have been
reading Hemingway""), Hugo's _Les Misérables,_ Paton's _Cry, the Beloved Country,_
Truman Capote, and  _The Chosen,_ yet she finds the portable Faulkner ""a bit much""
(LOL). I'm trying to convince her to appreciate Renoir, whom I've recently discovered: Zia
finally demurs after viewing his work at the National Gallery in London: ""He certainly was
talented"" (LOL). Both these fourteen-year-olds will become writers and teachers, though
of slightly different ilks. Eva is playing Mozart sonatas with her grandfather in Germany. 
Strong, smart, talented, and insightful, she'll remain engaged with film for many years
before becoming a successful insurance broker specializing in personal property in the
Hamptons.
We are children of the 1970s: ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" the Carpenters, the Beatles'
_Revolver,_ incense burners, candles, Biba eye shadow, bell bottoms, catch phrases (""ya
dig?!"").
We  constantly have sleep-overs at one another's houses. We have lots of crushes.
There is something about a ""rhinoceros' toenail,"" alluded to several times in the letters,
that we all find side-splittingly funny.
We have nicknames for one another: I am ""Susi"" (why?), 'Willie,' and 'Willy,' Eva is 'Evy.'
I am so grateful for these girls.
I am so grateful for these friendships.
It occurs to me in writing that perhaps our childhoods -- or the fragments of them that
live on to spark further memory -- weren't all that unusual. Maybe they're not even all
that different, in some ways, from those of NYC girls today attending one of several girls'
private schools on the UES.
So what was so special about my childhood?
It was mine.

355,"Thankfully, I seem to have averted, so far, the worst side effects of last Friday's infusion
(my second with Elahere): the horrendous stomach cramps that felt like a massage of
my intestines  -- and not in a good way. I do have some stomach discomfort and bad
diarrhea (hopefully not tmi? Cancer has made me lose any iota of  embarrassment  I
ever had about my body and its functions!). This last symptom also means dehydration
that I'm always trying to combat, and  may call for another infusion of fluids, like last
time. Otherwise, I'm fatigued, but that symptom's been worse before, too.
Next infusion: Friday, May 26. Then, presumably, a scan. I'll be curious/anxious for the
                    
results. Some women in the Elahere FB group I joined are reporting improvements,
others not. As Elahere may be my 'chemo of last resort,' I'll be directing my fervent
wishes towards stabilization or reduction of my cancer load. Needless to say, a 'cure' is
off the table. My goal is to stay alive and enjoy a decent quality of life.
I really want to sneak off to Paris for a week or ten days after my third infusion. Maybe?
I felt well enough yesterday to briefly attend a brunch in honor of one of my former, and
favorite, students, Casey, whose career at Penn State has been nothing short of
phenomenal. I worked with her as a freshman in my course on France and the Holocaust
in Film and Literature (she also participated in the Holocaust-focused weeklong trip to
Paris I led over spring break 2019 - right before I was diagnosed). A student in the
Schreyer Honors College here (from which Ben also graduated), Casey has taken
advantage of every opportunity to learn, grow, and investigate future career
possibilities; this led her to study abroad experiences in Paris, Poland (a Holocaust-
focused trip), Israel (archaeological dig), and Curaçao (museum work). She won first
prize from the PSU libraries for her BA/MA thesis on Jewish communities in central
Pennsylvania. Next year she'll be a public educator at Neuengamme concentration
camp. In any event, It was delightful to be able to honor Casey and also to feel a bit back
'in the mix.' It made me realize how much I miss and feel energized by helping students
achieve their goals.
I've made a nice connection through the online Elahere group: a woman named Karen
whose treatment follows the exact same schedule as mine (she also had her second
infusion of Elahere last Friday and we are checking in with one another about side
effects). Karen is a poet living in the Boston area. I read several of her poems about
cancer online and find them quite affecting: https://donyorty.com/2023/04/30/karen-
friedland-reads-from-incurable-inoperable-poems-and-notes-from-a-deadly-diagnosis/. It
feels comforting to be in lockstep with another Elahere user/kindred spirit of sorts. We
seem to have a lot in common!
I greatly look forward to Ben and Sammi's visit this weekend. They usually prepare a nice
Mothers Day breakfast for us (I couldn't resist ordering some very pretty petits fours
from The Cakeshop by Tati), which we'll follow with a jaunt in the country (to discover
one of PA's charming covered bridges? a greenhouse? an antiques store?) and perhaps a
beer at one of several new breweries in the area. Ben has made time to help me tick off
one of my very few bucket list items - any guesses? And Sammi and I will enjoy a girls'

the most joyous, serene May days.
One morning last week, I awoke sensing that my eyesight had precipitously declined, as
all surrounding me was a blur. I was fairly certain that a frightening side effect of
Elahere, ocular toxicity, had gotten hold of me and hung over me like the sword of
Damocles. Strangely (or not), many of the women reporting this symptom pinpointed its
inception at about ten days past the second infusion (this was my case too). Fortunately,
I had an ophthalmologist appointment just a few days after this. Dr. Marcovitch
confirmed that both my corneas were damaged; the right one, he said, was damaged so
badly that it fell below the minimum strength legally required to drive. Fortunately in PA
you only need one 'good' eye to drive. I'm managing to drive when necessary, although
my eyesight's somewhat blurry; Ben and Sammi felt understandably nervous about my
driving back from the train station in Lewistown (about 25 miles away) after depositing
Sammi there, but I knew that if I couldn't get out and about on a beautiful May day, I'd
become depressed. No amount of attempting to see clearly with glasses, without
glasses, with or without sunglasses etc. really helps as my vision has changed so
radically, so suddenly. But I'm managing. Dr. Marcovich advised me to get back on the
steroid eye drops four times a day, every day (instead of for only ten days out of the
month); I'll go back to him on Monday and see if this has helped. I hope he will take
some time to get up to speed on my problem; he doesn't seem to know much about
Elahere and its effects (in fact, he had to Google information about it while I was there!).
This condition (keratitis is the generic name for corneal damage) is supposedly
reversible; at the same time blindness is another potential side effect of Elahere
infusions (!) but I've not heard of anyone going blind from this drug. Talk about being
between Scylla and Charybdis... Meanwhile, I'm forging ahead, like the Knight in _Monty
Python and the Holy Grail,_ who remarks, after having his arm severely wounded and
squirting abundant blood in a sword fight, 'Tis but a scratch.' LOL.
                    
I'm supposed to have my third infusion next Friday but I suppose we'll have to see how
my eyes are faring. I'll see Dr. Marcovich again on Monday and he'll examine my
corneas. If there's still severe damage, I am not sure whether Dr. Patel will want to wait a
week or so until my eyes improve (presuming they improve), before proceeding to the
next infusion.
I am also continuing to experience on and off the terrible GI cramping brought about by
Elahere, sometimes accompanied by chills (but no fever). It's tiring and I feel better
when I'm experiencing this discomfort if I lie down. The cramping etc. has been so bad a
few times that I've thought of giving up, but then remind myself that the bad days are
(usually, up to this point) followed by better/good ones. And when the good ones arrive,
I'm angry at myself for even thinking of calling it quits.
I'm putting the brakes on certain plans until the above-mentioned issues are resolved.
While meeting with my palliative care doctor last week, she told me that a therapist
specializing in oncology patients has joined the oncology team at Geisinger. I have an
appointment with her on the 31st as I'd like to see what she could bring to the table that
might help me. Although I have a very good therapist with whom I've worked with for
over a decade and whom I see every other week, I am curious to explore this new
avenue too.
May days: Ben and Sammi temper the suffering with joy and bring much serenity,
energy, helpfulness, and happiness to our home. They helped make my Mother's Day
wonderful, as we've been celebrating the holiday together the past several years. For
brunch, they made me farm fresh eggs (so yummy!) and bacon (also from a local farm),
fruit salad, bagels, smoked salmon and cream cheese, and creamed herring and pickles
from Shelsky's in Brooklyn. I bought, from the marvelous Cake Shop by Tati, the most
delightful and delicious petits fours, coated in icing and piped spring flowers, with moist
cake layers separated by jam. We then sat by the creek in Spring Creek Park, enjoying
the sun and the pretty pastel colors of spring (green, pink, white). Following that, we
returned home where we caught the second half of the Celtics-76ers game (it's all about
the NBA playoffs in our house these days), then ventured out again to a new brewery in
town to enjoy a frosty beer in radiant sunshine. Despite all the satisfaction I garnered
from my career (and my career was going gangbusters when I was diagnosed, sigh...), I
still think motherhood is the best gig ever and am eternally grateful for my child.
Tuesday Sammi and I enjoyed a 'girls spa day' at the Omni Bedford Springs Resort, about
a 1 1/4 hour drive from State College. My grad school besties Vinni and Isabelle, and I,
had spent two wonderful days last year hiking the trails on the property leading to
various springs (which attracted all manner of 'curists and tourists' in the 19th century),
dining in a nice Italian restaurant in the cute town of Bedford, cooking s'mores over an
outdoor fire pit, drinking champagne, indulging in spa treatments and a wonderful
                    
variety of baths and sauna, and purchasing a few of the spa's signature bath products,
all honeysuckle based. One day not long ago I had the thought that a spa day would be a
nice birthday treat for Sammi, a relaxing getaway for me, and an opportunity for me to
catch up in depth with Sammi about her recent year in Vienna. We both luxuriated in
'spa pedicures' featuring all kinds of scrubs, rubs, lotions, leg massages, then polish (a
Merlot color for me, pastel blue for Sammi). We ate lunch outside (pretty day but turned
a bit cloudy) and looked at some of the memorabilia in the historic hotel (the guest
register on display featured both Presidents James Buchanan and James Polk). Then we
headed back to the spa for a good hour of showering, soaking in both hot and cold tubs
featuring jets directed at different body parts - shoulders, neck, lower back etc.,
sweating in the sauna infused with eucalyptus oil, and finally relaxing in a tranquil room
with potted palms, comfy chaises, soft throw blankets, pitchers of cucumber water, fresh
strawberries... I think I snoozed a bit. Otherwise, we gabbed the whole time (Sammi
drove both ways due to my vision problems). It was delightful to spend the day with
Sammi.
On the way home, I stopped off to vote in our municipal elections. Every election is so
crucial. I'm pleased to see that a progressive slate of school board candidates won their
election.
On the way home from dropping Sammi off in Lewistown yesterday, I stopped at several
farms and the big farmers market in Belleville, found some good-looking asparagus from
someone's uncle's farm. I've made asparagus soup and tonight am making an Ottolenghi
asparagus salad with an interesting-sounding dressing/topping. Maybe an asparagus
galette soon?
Other May days stuff: a visit from a dear friend I hadn't seen in quite a while; lunch at a
Venezuelan place with my friend Kathryn followed by a walk in Thompson Woods
Preserve, which I did not know about.
Tomorrow is 'bucket list' day. I hope it's fun and that I have the stamina for it. No,
Melissa, it's not a ride in a hot-air balloon but that's a great guess! :)

359,"Over my many years of driving along backroads in central PA, I've delighted at the
figures, seen in miniature from afar, which render the surrounding landscapes
picturesque and serene: Amish women stooped over to  hoe their vegetable gardens or
collect eggs from their chickens; farmers rolling up bales of hay; Amish children playing
in the yard of a one-room schoolhouse or seated in a cart, led around the backyard by a
miniature horse. These charming figures, a bit idealized and precious, always called to
mind for me the residents of medieval fiefs illustrating the famous medieval book of
hours, The Very Rich Hours of Jean, duc de Berry (Les Très Riches Heures de Jean, duc de
Berry) or, in an Art nouveau vein, the women picking flowers or raking leaves throughout
the year in the calendar illustrated by Eugène Grasset, Les Mois.
In the spring and fall, sightings of anglers in the network of creeks running through
Penns Valley have also enchanted me. Casting, catching, or simply standing waist deep
in the chilly creek, these solitary figures dotting the water, dappled by sunlight or
shrouded in mist, seem enveloped in a blissful stillness, a state of Zen. Less ambitiously,
kids and adults dangle all manner of fishing rods into the creek from embankments lining
it.
And so we arrive at my one and only bucket list experience (sure, there are lots of
others, but they're currently beyond my reach). Accompanied by Tess, our most
excellent guide, Ben and I spent the day learning how to fly fish for trout in a creek
reputed internationally for this activity. At The Feathered Hook in Coburn, PA, ground
zero for all things fly fishing in these parts -- which also boasts a bed and breakfast and a
lodge for the many anglers both skilled and novice, corporate groups, and others -- we
were given waders, extremely heavy boots, and a wading stick. Tess took us to a spot
that she intuited would yield trout (catch and release). She explained why Penn's Creek,
which is something like twenty-seven miles long, is such an appealing body of water for
anglers: a microclimate filled with the types of insects trout like to feed on, for example,
and ultra-clean water boasting a specific Ph-level. Once we had entered the creek and
walked to about the middle of it (a folding chair was an enormous help for me), Tess
taught us the basics of casting relying on something called ""European technique,"" which
seemed so complicated initially that I almost gave up before we started (""nevertheless,
she persisted""). The exact positioning of the rod and the fishing line, of the body in
relation to the water, the speed at which the line is dragged through the water, every
detail is calibrated. Getting the fish in the net once caught seemed to require even more
precision. Tess gave Ben a bit more instruction than me (as I had expected); advising
him to take three steps to the left, one step forward, etc. and to cast his rod towards a
rippling and roiling spot, which the fish apparently like because of the oxygen pockets it
creates. He looked very much the natural. I was perfectly content to sit in my folding
chair casting, although I did change position several times (my badly compromised
vision, about which more later, was a challenge). I took several breaks from fishing to
                    
simply savor the environment: the clear, cold water; birds chirping; verdant trees lining
each bank; and blue sky (until it turned cloudy). We bantered with the anglers walking
by, asking how many fish we had caught.
We caught five! Ben 4, Willa 1. Ben caught one rainbow trout and three brown trout.
Gorgeous fish, with silky skin dappled with brown spots. I was *amazed* that I caught a
fish, a small, speckled brown trout. Tess skillfully taught us how to work our rods until
she could maneuver the fish into the net.
We sat on an embankment and ate lunch. As part of our 'package,' Tess brought subs,
drinks and all kinds of snacks. She lives half the year in Bozeman, MT, and fishes out
there too, leading workshops for women anglers (or wannabe anglers) -- a great idea as
the sport seems quite male-dominated. We found no lack of common interests
(progressive politics - yay! - cooking, Penn State, life in central PA etc.). She was so
friendly and such a good teacher.
We called it quits around 3:00 as we were tiring (once again, I seemed to 'rise to the
occasion' in terms of stamina; I actually could have kept going a bit longer). I found the
experience of fly fishing enticing. I'd love to get out there again and spend the day
sitting in the middle of that cool creek, casting my rod (might be a bit of a challenge on
my own, though....). The monotony didn't bother me; on the contrary, I found it calming. 
So maybe one day you'll find that I've hung a shingle on my front doo: Gone fishin'....
So that's my 'big fish' story!

Unfortunately, my vision has worsened even further since last week. Perhaps I need
another type of steroid drop. Everything's  blurry -- and I'm extremely worried. I can't
make out the score in the basketball game on my large t.v. screen. I must put my face
nearly up to my large computer screen to type. I will try not to drive for the near future
unless completely necessary. I will see Dr. Marcovich, the ophthalmologist, h on Monday
and impress upon him that I'm fighting for my life here and need him to be on board
100%; I'll also contact Dr. Patel and explain what's going on so we can determine
whether or not I'll receive my third infusion on Friday, and at what dosage. I'll ask Dr. P's
nurse to send Dr. Marcovich (again) the info sheet about Elahere so that he can make
*sure* to educate himself about this drug. I sorely wish I could go to the Wilmer Eye
Institute at Hopkins; perhaps I will if I do not get satisfaction here asap.  I don't mean to
be melodramatic, but will I need to choose between blindness and death? Obviously, it's
a depressing situation. I might need to have a 'guest blogger' (!) for one of my next
postings if I don't see improvement in my vision soon.
                    
'Tis but a scratch' -ha.
Thankfully, I've had such a pleasant visit with Ben, as always (and with Sammi earlier
this week). He's been kind and attentive and helpful and loving in every way. Today we
enjoyed breakfast pastries and coffee at the Cake Shop by Tati, followed by a trip to
Sammi's Greenhouse to purchase some begonias and thyme to pot, and finished off with
a visit to my favorite antiques store, where I bought a few pretty Limoges pieces in
cobalt blue to adorn my table (when cooking becomes less challenging....). Tonight Ben's
dad Michael invited us over for grilled hot dogs (a favorite of mine) and hamburgers. I'll
be sad to see Ben return to NY tomorrow but hopefully I'll see him before long. His dad is
driving him to pick up his rental car as I don't want to risk driving when I don't absolutely
have to. :(

P.S. I meant to record a recurrent dream I had last night. Overarching theme: I'm going
away for a long trip but am not ready. There is much that ties me to the 'here and now'
and it's unclear if I'll even make it to the journey that it's somehow necessary for me to
embark upon.
 
In this iteration: I'm in close striking distance to the boarding gate of the plane that I'm
supposed to leave on but have too much carry on baggage and 'they' (gatekeepers)
won't let me on the flight. I am desperately trying to shove bags inside bags to reduce
my number of carry-on items, all the while conscious that the plane will be departing
soon. I'm a hot mess trying to organize all my stuff and to make it more compact. While
I'm doing this, I also realize that I have left many personal items (clothes etc.) in the
place I was  staying (perhaps an Airbnb or a rental; I can visualize my stuff strewn about
that place and am worried about the consequences when the owners find out about the
mess I've left).",4,neutral,0.5243866,0.03147299,0.0032754925,0.280904,0.02223116,0.5243866,0.05152785,0.086201906
362,"I'll try to blog instead of vlog here, as at the moment I'm able to see the  lettering on the
screen from about 1.5 ft. away. To update everyone and proceeding in reverse order:
Tomorrow I am going to Hopkins for an appointment with Dr. Oliver Schein, one of the
'big guns' (I guess) at the Wilmer Eye Institute. I'm very much hoping he will have a
concrete suggestion for my still extremely blurry vision and/or will help me understand
to what this problem is due. I am still seeing Dr. Marcovitch in State College but felt that
I definitely needed input from a (cornea) specialist who may have some experience
seeing Elahere patients. And I simply can't continue in such a radically compromised
state!
So back to Charm City tomorrow, hon. My appointment's at 1:30 to enable a roundtrip in
one day. I'm using a driver Michael and Sue suggested, who sounded quite nice on the
phone. She'll pick me up at 8:45 at my house and will drive us to Hopkins in my car. My
friend Sandy also very kindly offered to take me, and it's always a bit of a (fun)
adventure when we make the trip together, but I don't want to impose on my friends all
the time. I may need to rely on them again! I would love to see my Baltimore friends and
family tomorrow but will be short on time, unfortunately.
This past Friday I received my third dose of Elahere (reduced by 15% because of the
ocular toxicity I've experienced) + a two-hour magnesium infusion. Dr. Patel suggested
we ""take the risk"" when I met with him last Thursday. What annoyed me was that he had
not read any notes from Dr. Marcovitch, which I had taken pains to have sent to Dr.
Patel, so Dr. P. had to rely on *my summary* of my visit with Dr. Marcovitch to make this
important decision about my chemo! Seemed pretty lame to me to rely on this
                    
'laywoman's' account (and convinced me further that Hopkins was the ticket...).
Subsequently, I found out that Drs. Patel and Marcovitch spoke about my case on the
phone, which put my mind at ease as at least one doctor previously seemed resistant to
making the necessary effort to work as a team. And I need a team!
Chemo was rough this week. I experienced no other side effects other than fatigue (and
the lingering vision issues) but the exhaustion was a doozy. I slept most of Saturday and
Sunday (of course while kicking myself that I 'should' be doing something 'productive').
Saturday morning I was able only to pick up some fresh strawberries (I can drive within a
mile's radius when needed) and Sunday evening I watched the basketball playoffs (with
my face practically smushed against the t.v.).
W I had had a third appointment with Dr. Marcovitch. He said my corneas actually looked
much better (which opened the door for me to receive chemo two days later). But then
why is my vision still so compromised? He couldn't really pronounce on that question: it
might be a rapid worsening of my cataracts (which need to be operated on); it might be
a rapid worsening of my vision due to factors other than corneal damage. How these
three factors may or may not be working together or separately is unclear to me (and, I
think, to him). He said he could probably give me a new prescription, but it's likely to
change again. At this point, I'm pretty desperate to have my vision improve even
somewhat. So perhaps it's merely a matter of needing a new prescription after a drastic
change in vision. Hopefully tomorrow's appointment will help clarify (no pun intended!)
the situation.
I felt much less alone having two lovely friends accompany me to my appointments last
week: my friend John O., who took me to Dr. Patel's (I treated him afterwards to
coffee/tea in the garden of Café Lemont), and my friend Lisa S., who came with me to Dr.
Marcovitch's (aka 'the prune') and then to lunch at a tasty local taco place. And my great
combo of Janis and Jackie provided chemo rides this past Friday. All this helped me feel
less isolated, as the dimming of my vision + the exhaustion from chemo were conspiring
to make me feel as if I were sequestered in a black hole.
I'll have a CT scan on June 20th. This will produce the most conclusive evidence about
whether Elahere is working (ie stabilizing or reducing my tumor size/cancer load) and
thus whether I will continue treatment with this drug. As far as I know there is no plan B
(more like plan 'P' at this point...) but I'm putting that out of my mind for now.
Today I met via vidchat with a psychosocial oncologist to see what she might bring to the
table. My palliative care doctor suggested I might meet with her, as she's now part of the
Geisinger oncology team. I might try another session or two with her; I'm not positive I'll
pursue further. It wasn't unhelpful but perhaps a bit 'formulaic.' There is some sort of
workbook I'd need to complete based on my reading of Viktor Frankl's _Man's  Search for
Meaning_ (a book on my 'to read' list in any case). I'm not unconvinced that my long-
                    
time therapist, although not specialized in oncology patients, doesn't provide enough
insight into my situation to be helpful (and she's super-smart). I do have curiosity,
however, about some of the concepts mentioned by Dr. Perez, such as that of ""radical
acceptance."" At this point, though, I'm not sure I need more psychotherapy to muddle
through facing a terminal illness, as opposed to reading more philosophy, religion etc.
We'll see.
Was delighted that Ben and Sammi were invited to Shabbos dinner in Crown Heights
with his (second) cousins Zev and Yosef (two of the sons of my first cousin, David) and
his lively (second) cousin from New Zealand, Gresham (son of David's sister, Janie). A
good time was had by all, apparently. The next generation after mine and my cousins'
(and brother's) is coming together in a beautiful 'rainbow coalition"" (of degrees of faith,
nationality, profession etc.) and I feel that (we're) all is in good hands. This makes me

363,"I meant to include two items in my last post: 1)I recently watched (sitting about 6 inches
from the t.v. screen) Michael J. Fox's new documentary about his life and career, ""Still""
(on Apple TV+). Well-made, moving and 'relatable' (a word I dislike, but whatever)
regarding drastically reduced horizons, living long-term with incurable illness, ""radical
acceptance,"" etc.; 2)At the nadir of my vision issues, about a week or so ago, I decided
to listen to audiobooks and podcasts to pass the time. Something of a failed experiment
on two counts as a)the soothing voice of the reader of Michael Chabon's _The Amazing
Adventures..._ put me to sleep (!) and b)I had a very marked PTSD-type reaction to the
intro to/techno-ish music accompanying the _NYTimes_ podcast, ""The Daily,"" which I
used to listen to for hours on end about four years ago, immobilized on my chaise and in
pain after my big debulking surgery in 2019. I had no idea these few seconds would be
such a trigger...
*********
Back from Hopkins on Tuesday, back from an appointment yesterday with Dr.
Marcovitch. I was thanking some higher power this morning for the fact that two days
ago -- for the first time in about a month -- I could sense my sight improving. On the
drive down to Baltimore, the passing landscape appeared in much more vivid relief than
before; the past two days my vision has been less blurred although by no means perfect.
It's still hard to make out fine detail. But I no longer feel the need to feel the space in
front of me to assess the safety of walking. And yesterday Dr. Marcovitch cleared me for
driving during the day! I drove about two miles to my dermatologist's office this morning
and I felt confident doing so. However, I'm still accepting rides for longer drives and until
I've made a fuller return to clear-sightedness.
The reason I can see better (but this seems actually part of a more complicated
interaction among corneas, cataracts, and compromised vision) is that, per Dr.
Marcovitch, my left cornea is almost completely healed and my right one looks dry but is
coming along (>continue with artificial tears every few hours). Why my corneas have
improved while my vision appears radically worse is, again, complicated. It may be that
the irregularities on my corneas (assessed by a special machine at Hopkins that
produced a kind of topographical map of my corneas), while less notable than before,
are positioned right at the center of the surface (ie the epithelium) of the cornea, where
they impact vision most dramatically.
Indeed, my vision has become significantly worse as a result of this episode. *This* fact
is not likely to change much. Obviously, this is a disappointment. I have a prescription for
new lenses but may only wind up with a left lens, as the decline is most dramatic in my
left eye (my right eye, in fact, has not changed that much). Because my vision is sort of
in flux, it's possible I may need a new prescription before long.
As mentioned, what has improved are my corneas. The damage to this transparent layer,
                    
again, is most apparent on their surface; the rest of the layer is intact. Both doctors
concur that my corneas should return to normal soon. 
Hope that I'm not 'speaking out of school' here. Am trying to provide as clear yet
accurate an explanation as I'm able of ocular issues whose vocabulary is foreign to me!
The trip to Hopkins and back, twelve hours in toto, was pretty exhausting for me, yet
quite useful. Michael and Sue had connected me with an excellent driver based nearby
who also drives a Fullington bus. We took my car and reached Baltimore in about three
hours, with about 45 mn to spare before my appointment. I found the Wilmer Eye
Institute, which I had passed many times during my previous trips to Hopkins. When I
checked in, the clerk assisting me stood up, walked over to a side desk and handed me a
large, rectangular, flat white box. ""Oh great,"" I thought, ""some big pharma company is
foisting samples and pamphlets onto the Hopkins people, which they in turn are dumping
on us!"" Only on closer look, and to my absolute surprise, did I see a note in French
affixed to the box, addressed to ""notre chère cousine,"" wishing me well with my
appointment and hinting at some delicious treats inside to enjoy on the ride home (I
hadn't eaten lunch and was famished). Indeed, nestled inside the box were an
assortment of yummies that looked like they came straight from a French pâtisserie:
lemon tart, macarons, croissant. My darling Baltimore cousins  -- ""les Aigles"" (the Eagle
family) had gotten wind of my appointment (likely from this blog?), know all about my
Francophilia of course, and had shopped for me at a kosher boulangerie. This remarkably
thoughtful gesture in the midst of a stressful day lifted me up and reminded me of the
miraculous moments of human connection that can make a twelve-hour schlep to
Baltimore and back worthwhile! Truly the highlight of my day. [In my previous post, I
wrote about how Ben and Sammi recently experienced more 'cousin love' in Brooklyn
with two of these Baltimore-born sons of my cousins David and Yehudis, Zev and Yosef].
I spent about 1.5 hours being examined by Dr. Oliver Schein, his fellow (Dr. Adam
something), and their assistant, who performed a battery of preliminary tests on me. The
team was very thorough, testing my eyes in various ways with seemingly more up to
date equipment than at Dr. Marcovitch's office and, as mentioned, photographing my
corneas.
Dr. Schein seemed personable and kind (his fellow actually spent longer with me than he
did). Based on his experience of observing how other chemo drugs (but not Elahere...)
can affect vision, he reiterated to me that the intense blurriness I was experiencing
would dissipate and my corneas would heal, but that this could take one-two months
total (I had been seduced into anticipating a much shorter timeline based on accounts by
a few women in my Elahere chat room -- a small sample, to be sure). He provided me
with a new prescription. He asked to see notes from my baseline eye exam on Jan. 4 with
Dr. Nelson in State College, from just before I was to start receiving treatment with
Elahere. And he asked his fellow to proceed with a basic measure that Dr. Marcovitch
                    
had seemed resistant to using: inserting eye plugs. Small silicone plugs are placed in the
top and bottom tear ducts; consequently, one's tears do not drain but instead remain on
the surface of the eye, 'irrigating' it with natural tears and providing continuous
hydration that can benefit the eye. Dr. Adam X inserted these plugs for me (I hardly feel
them as they're tiny). I don't remember what else we discussed but Dr. Schein genuinely
seemed kind and strongly disposed to help me. We didn't discuss a return visit but I'd
like to think that I could avail myself once again of the excellent care at Hopkins if/when
needed.
The last month's been a misery. Try to imagine, in as much detail as possible, what it
would mean for you to have your sight radically compromised. I know that people adjust
('radical acceptance?'), yet I still feel much compassion for the legally blind living in a
'sighted' world (I myself had passed into this realm about a week ago).
As for the million dollar question - will this cycle repeat after subsequent Elahere
infusions? - I don't know but somehow I tend to think not. And for another million dollars:
will I even be having another infusion of Elahere? The results of my CT-scan on June 20th
will tell. So now 'all' I have to worry about is the possibility of progression of my disease
despite treatment or discovery of new mets in my brain and/or elsewhere. LOL. I'll stick
with considering the next eleven days a reprieve -- and will bend with the bamboo.
Things have skewed off kilter the past month in terms of any attempts I might make to
formulate summer plans, goals (such as they are), even day to day objectives. I am
toying with the idea of trying to honor the trying emotions of the past month (and four+
years) in a non-judgmental way, which does not mean that I find them 'acceptable' for
myself (or anyone else, for that matter).
So much is out of our control.

On the drive home, I asked Millie to swing by Alvaro's Bakery in Harrisburg, my usual pit
stop between B'more or D.C. and State College, for a few more treats for both of us and
a dinner entrée for me as I was way too exhausted to cook (indeed, I *needed*
someone's Italian-American mama to cook up some lasagna and meatballs for me and
Alvaro's happily obliged).
Looking forward to a little country jaunt to buy flowers, herbs etc. tomorrow with my
friend John. Was at the farm market about a mile from my house this morning. The
strawberries this year are a wonder.",4,neutral,0.551853,0.012507127,0.026102712,0.089763105,0.116021305,0.551853,0.1743938,0.029358918
364,"Last weekend was fairly miserable. I don't think I realized how tired I was, mentally and
physically, from the quick round-trip to Hopkins. I still wasn't seeing well. I think I slept
most of the weekend, besides taking a drive on Saturday and attending an event Friday
night (about which more further on). My body was craving sleep (and actually still does,
often). My sides/pleura shading into my back, abdomen, and stomach all ached, as if I
had a band of pain girding the middle section of my body. The pain tired me further.
Oxycodone helped (my palliative care dr. said I could even increase my dose by 50%,
although I'm still trying to not take more than two pills a day). I had to cancel three
social engagements and missed the second annual Pride parade in town, a welcome
addition to State College's 'culture' and vibe, which of course made me sad. Dark
thoughts were getting the better of me. I was convinced the pain was a harbinger of
imminent death. Somehow I managed to not spiral down completely, reminding myself
of the simple fact that, at least for now, there are good and bad days.
This week has been better. I still need a good amount of sleep (but am sleeping
erratically), but my pain has decreased while my energy has increased. And my vision is
improving! This means I can drive, cook, write, watch t.v., read etc. - an enormous step
forward. I tried to get my new prescription for lenses filled today but I botched the
mission (for reasons too complicated and uninteresting to explain) so I will hopefully take
care of that on Monday, the day I also have an eye doctor appointment here. What else?
I had appointments with my therapist and my palliative care doc, both stalwart pillars of
my medical/care team.
Next Tuesday afternoon I'll have a CT-scan to determine whether Elahere is working,
whether my disease has progressed, remained stable, or even regressed. I am trying not
to think about the scan until Monday, not to generate anxiety that may or may not be
warranted. There's no Plan B that I know of; at this point, we're sort of winging it,
relieved that a new drug came along in time for my doctors to add it to the treatment
plan. The thought that I *might* need to stop treatment, if Elahere's not helping, while
still feeling relatively ok overall is certainly sobering.
This week was another one in which I felt rather 'unmoored,' as if the ground was shifting
under my feet. Plans get cancelled. A scan looms. My vision improves but remains iffy.
Fatigue weighs on me sometimes. Friends leave town on vacation, coming and going. I
*did* try to get a grip by arranging a July vacation for myself, Ben and Sammi, in a place
I love. Something to look forward to! I won't say more for now so as not to jinx these
plans. But I hope they'll help me plant my feet on terra firma after several weeks of
feeling adrift.
Last Friday night, despite not feeling 100%, I attended a Pride-themed service at our
synagogue, the first in my memory. My wonderful chemo nurse, Brianne, had expressed
                    
an interest in going (her Lutheran pastor had apparently announced it to his
congregation), along with her wife, Natalie, and charming daughter, Kaylen. The service
featured specially selected, Pride-themed readings. I was gratified for the large turnout
(including many people I didn't know, who also wished to attend such a purposefully
inclusive service). Coincidentally, Brianne and Natalie (and Kaylen) knew a number of
people there from school, work, and other circles. It feels so important to show up for
one another (and not just at events 'designated' for this...). I may try to put this belief
into practice again tomorrow if/when I check out the town's Juneteenth goings-on.
Of course, I'm in farmers market heaven right now. I realize that I much prefer summer
to winter cooking because of the abundant 'farm to table' possibilities. Now that I can
see better, my cooking mojo has returned; this week I made a beet salad with goat
cheese and pecans; warm German potato salad (had a craving, but I think it's too heavy
a dish for me) and garlic scape pesto (packs a garlicy punch - oh my!). I'm also intensely
into iced teas right now and am experimenting with different varieties. Plan to start
cooking for others soon, too. 
A restful sabbath to all.

366,"The radiologists' report on my last scan, which I read Wednesday, reveals a significant
progression of my disease, so much so that Dr. Patel admitted to me when I saw him on
Thursday that he felt apprehensive about speaking with me that day. It turned out I
made his task much easier by being what he termed 'practical' - a word seldom if ever
applied to me! - but by which I think he meant some combination of realistic and
graceful (ie full of grace).
Always hard for me to parse the medical language but Dr. Patel helped: increase in the
size of several lymph nodes, at least one in the thoracic area; increase in size of spots on
liver; increase in size of at least one tumor at base of abdomen. These areas are not
necessary painful for me (although the abdominal tumor causes discomfort); instead, for
some reason, my back and 'flanks' ache *a lot* (a heating pad helps, as does
Oxycodone, which I'm relying on a bit more now). This might simply be from arthritis or
else from cancer in the pleura (membrane lining the thorax and coating the lungs);
                    
cancer is there.
I asked Dr. P. if it is common for cancer to accelerate in this way, as this is certainly the
'worst' scan report I've seen throughout my illness. He (re) explained that after so many
lines of chemo being thrown at them, as had been my case, the cancer cells have
become expert at mutating and otherwise figuring out how to elude the drugs targeting
them. The cancer cells create their own environment within my body, complete with
blood supply and everything else they need to do their deadly deeds. Insidious, indeed.
Or maybe the worst 'tenants' ever, the ones who take over and trash your beautiful
home, causing permanent damage beyond repair.
I am certain that the doctors and other medical personnel reading this are not
necessarily surprised to learn of this progression, nor are a few friends who have lost
partners to cancer. I myself was not surprised, while still retaining a glimmer of hope due
to the promise of a newly-approved drug (I am detecting mixed results among women
currently on Elahere).
The 'good' news (!) in all this is the absence of fluid build-up, for example in my lungs.
Ironically, my magnesium level is back in normal range for the first time in a long while,
which mean no magnesium infusion yesterday. Obviously, we're discontinuing Elahere as
well. Both Dr. Patel and a fellow who was shadowing him on Thursday remarked on how
well I look; my by now legendary (lol) positive attitude tempered with realism impressed
her. It's got to have helped some but sadly is not sufficient to beat back those cancer
cells.
Back on the rollercoaster, part XXX?: Yesterday, Dr. Beavis emailed me to say she had
seen the scans (her own radiologists produced a report on them also), to express regret
at what they show, and to offer to talk about potential next steps (??) and/or possibility
of clinical trials at Hopkins. The challenge here will be logistical; she'll be on vacation July
2-11. We can meet virtually, but I'll need to drive to MD as she can't practice across
state lines. And I'm scheduled to be away July 7-12. I'll wait until Monday to see what she
can offer.
I of course want to hear what she has to say. And in the name of 'due diligence,' I'll likely
call/write MSK and see if they have anything to offer. I may look into alternative
treatments too. But quality of life is my overriding concern; given my relative dearth of
energy these days and the pain I'm currently dealing with, I'm adamant about using my
time/energy for activities and people that/who give me pleasure.
It's a strange time. Lots of emotions. I really don't know what I should be doing, thinking,
feeling. Still trying to throw out as much junk, old papers etc. as possible and get
organized. But it's really been the same old existential question all along, per the title of
the Gauguin painting: ""Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?""
                    
Ben will be coming from NY over July 4th weekend. Of course, I can't wait to see him.
Having him here makes me feel so much better. If my health holds (and Dr. Patel felt it
will, as the vacay is coming right up), Ben and I will take off from here by car on July 7th,
staying overnight at a midway point of Fishkill, NY. The next day we'll pick up Sammi at a
train station along our route and head to the magnificent Chatham Bars Hotel on the
Cape for a few days of sun, beach, oysters, lobster rolls (although I don't have much of
an appetite!) and relaxing. I am unsure whether I'll return via NY or if we'll devise
another plan.
Local friends (or even those w/in driving distance!): if you feel inclined to pay me a
shortish visit, I would love that! We can sit in the sun room or outdoors and have some
iced tea, maybe even trade a few memories. No need to feel obligated, though.
Unfortunately, I'm currently not really able to run around as is my preference, but I'm
still likely up for lunch or iced tea out (or a cocktail - why not!), a drive in the country etc.
Enjoyed dinner with my friends John and Kathryn at the Hublersburg Inn a few nights
ago. And having a summery dinner w/friends tonight - very much looking forward.

367,"Here are the latest developments:
After much back and forth that only resolved yesterday, I was able to schedule a video
appointment with Dr. Beavis for tomorrow at 11:00. She's extremely busy as she's
leaving for vacation on the 2nd for ten days and all sorts of 'extras' (surgeries, meetings
etc.) have been crammed into her schedule; I am praying that she won't be 2.5 hours
late for our appointment, as she was last December. As all her appointments are via
video on Fridays, I once again have to *cross state lines into Maryland* to meet virtually
with her, as she can't practice across state lines (this stricture was eased during Covid
but is back in place now). The last time I had to make this scenario work, I drove to a
                    
dinky hotel in Hagerstown and stayed overnight. This time, I've hired a driver -- I've
never met her before but she works with the wonderful Millie, who drove me to the
Wilmer Eye Institute at Hopkins not long ago -- and rented office space in Hagerstown.
Renting co-working/workshare spaces is now a 'thing,' but as I've never availed myself of
such a space it proved a bit complicated. My first reservation was denied: no more place
at the space. With the intervention of a nice guy at central reservations (Salt Lake City,
UT) for the ""Davinci Rooms,"" I was able to reserve an office at another workshare place
in Hagerstown. Obviously this all took more time and energy than I hoped to expend and
I just hope it works out. Holiday traffic? Construction? Bend with the bamboo.
My hunch is that Dr. Beavis will be performing ""due diligence"" with me (as she should)
tomorrow, rather than producing some sort of trump card or miracle cure. We've agreed
that I'm at a 'critical juncture.' I certainly want to hear what she has to say, and have a
number of questions for her, but I'm keeping my expectations low. This being said, I
usually come away from meetings with her feeling more at peace than usual with my
situation.
I also wrote to Dr. Cohen at Sloan-Kettering, sending him the latest radiologists' report
on my CT-scan and inquiring whether MSK might have something to offer me. His nurse
replied that in order for Dr. Cohen to fully assess the possibilities, I need to send him all
my medical records (oncologist's notes, CT-scans and MRI reports etc.) dating from my
last visit to MSK, sometime last year. Another daunting task for sure, but I imagine I'll
send him the stuff he wants (project for the holiday weekend?). Last year I was ineligible
for any clinical trials at MSK because I had had too many lines of chemo; MSK apparently
has very strict requirements for admission to their clinical trials, so that they can ensure
a very uniform cohort of participants. Perhaps, though, something new has come along
there since last year. Worth a try.
I'm really not sure what else is worth a try at this point.
I wondered out loud to my therapist recently why I wasn't more utterly devastated by
regret and more wracked/wrecked by a sense of grotesque unfairness at this point,
about my career for example: all was on the up and up, with the prospect of another
book, prestigious invited lectures and visiting fellowships in the States and abroad,
interesting collaborations, museum work etc. all on the horizon. Or about the fact that I
may not get back to Paris, where I had a life or sorts (cue Meryl Streep, intoning with
wistful melancholy: ""I had a farm in Africa...""). My therapist conjectured that the fact that
I'm 'holding steady' (more or less; I have my moments, believe me) may relate to my
already having done much processing of these misfortunes. I certainly allowed anguish
to course through me (and out of me?) when I retired, so clearly was my work central to
my identity. The work of 'processing' has consumed at least part of every day of the past
four+ years for me. If this is indeed the case, if I've on some level at least 'come to
terms' with my awful situation (which is not to say I accept it, but I understand it to be
                    
the result of a terrible disease), then yay therapy. I'm grateful that the hard work has
been so productive.
Regret regarding *people* is another matter, which perhaps I'll be able to write about at
some point.
No real plans for the holiday weekend; it kind of crept up on me. Ben will be here on
Sunday, and that's of course the biggest treat. Perhaps Michael and Sue will invite me
over for a grilled hot dog (hint?), mouthwatering goodness.
I was so happy that several local friends liked my 'iced tea and chat in the sunroom'
idea. Visits from Kathryn and Maria, and a delivery of delicious chicken soup from
Monique, brought much cheer this week, and I look forward to seeing my friend Helen
later.
Again, apologies for delayed emails and texts. I'm sometimes in a lot of discomfort
(back/sides) and can't do much more than crash on the couch.",4,neutral,0.7660031,0.0069004647,0.002382347,0.023297826,0.07536641,0.7660031,0.07806051,0.04798941
368,"Friday I traveled round-trip to Hagerstown, MD, so I could have a video visit with Dr.
Beavis. It's about 2.5 hours each way. My driver, Della, was very competent (former
Fullington bus driver) and got us there and back safely and in good time. I had about 45
mn to get set up in an office at 5, Public Square, where a nice young women named
Caroline was waiting for me (someone really should write a murder mystery transpiring
within a network of these co-working spaces!).
                    
Dr. Beavis was only about 10 mn late logging on. We spent about 35 mn together before
she had to go perform a surgery. She's always quite clear and methodical in her
explanations. She presented what she feels are the three options available to me at this
point, with my cancer so advanced:
a)clinical trials, but only if they seem exceptionally promising. In my experience, I must
add, my brain mets have always been a deal breaker for cancer centers that are set on
comparing 'apples to apples' to achieve optimal results. Brain mets are a potentially
confounding factor. I am hoping to hear from MSK soon (they did contact me about
getting my records) and Dr. B. had not yet reached out to the trials team at Hopkins. The
thought of perhaps regular travel at this point to NYC or Baltimore is really quite
daunting to me. I don't have much stamina. And for the record, being based in my cozy,
peaceful home in SC, surrounded by friends here, with easy access to my medical team,
is really preferable to me as opposed basing myself in NY (where?). Still, I'll find out more
about this option.
b)taking one of two oral chemo meds and seeing if they might work. Success rate (this
would be my seventh line of chemo, with the success rate -- ie stabilizing or reducing of
cancer load -- diminishing with each line): 10-15%
c)Stopping treatment. No more poison in my body. I'd then be able to access home
hospice care, stronger pain meds etc.
I am not sure which option I'll pursue.
I am so tired, mentally and physically.
My entire midsection hurts a lot. As Dr. B. explained, there's a lot going on there:
enlarged lymph nodes near stomach, thorax; liver; pleura; slightly arthritic back; and lots
of sensitive nerve endings. Heating pad helps as does Oxycodone. My sleep doesn't
appear to be disrupted by the pain. I need a lot of rest as my body continues to fight the
cancer inside me.
Dr. B. then went over three likely death scenarios (I had been meaning to ask her about
this). I think I'll skip the details, none of which are pleasant, and write simply that in each
scenario a different organ would be the culprit: a)bowels/intestines; b)liver; c)brain. 
Death will be gradual, accompanied by increased fatigue, general 'slowing down,'
lessening of appetite etc.
Dr. B. said my disease has followed the course that she had anticipated from the
beginning.
                    
Looking at about six months.
Dr. Beavis and I agreed that this is all a terrible shame.
If I were you, I probably wouldn't know what to say, but you've proven me wrong before.
Feel free to DM or text me if you wish. There is something that you can do that would
make me happy, but no obligation! Please share a specific memory of me from our
relationship with one another. It can be anything at all, just something that sticks out in
your mind. It would give me pleasure to read these. Again, you can DM, email or text me.
And again, no obligation!
Ben is due to arrive very soon and I can't wait to see him. Michael is picking him up from
the train station in Lewistown. Somehow, I don't know how, I managed to do some
cooking: a delicious Spanish tomato soup I first sampled at my friend John Ochoa's
house; an apricot cobbler; beet salad. It's hard for me to cook these days. I lack energy
big time.
We'll be heading to Cape Cod on Friday, barring any unforeseen emergency.
At what point do I draw the veil over an experience that's feeling increasingly solitary? I
guess when things start to feel as if they're becoming too personal to share and/or if I'm
physically unable.
I'm not even checking this post for minor errors, just sending it as is. Thanks so much for
all the texts, emails etc. of concern. I am needing to rebound from the past few days but

369,"It's been a minute. In the interim, Ben was here for a week, followed by my trip to the
Cape with Ben and Sammi and  return via NYC, where I spent the night at my mom's. I'll
probably report on that interlude in my next post, reserving this one for a health update.
I've been showered with blessings in the form of emails, texts, even gifts from friends
and family (maybe partly in reaction to the sobering account of my virtual visit with Dr.
Beavis). I really want to respond to every one but it's taking a while. Here's why:
Actually, I'm sure it's not hard for you to imagine: the reality (mortality?) check from Dr.
Beavis really shook me, and I'm doing what I can to get my bearings, whatever that can
mean in this context. Related to this, of course, is the fact that I'm feeling generally
poorly (nevertheless, she persisted...); more on this below, but I lack energy even for
basic tasks (walking to the mailbox, cooking). Also, in the past two weeks I've been
blessed (yes, I'll use the word again) by conversations with several important people in
my life that have been exceedingly honest, raw, and, ultimately, *healing.* While these
moments of intensity have left me at peace, I also feel drained psychically from some
attempts at, if not closure, then unfiltered soul connection. Thank goodness therapy
prepared me for these encounters! In response to one of my postings, a while back my
friend David R. taught me the expression 'livin' large' as it pertains to some lifestyles in
the gorgeous wide-open spaces of the Colorado Rockies where he's made his home. I'm
'livin' large' emotionally, and sometimes it tires me!
So today I spent nearly four hours in the infusion room getting pumped up with
magnesium and iron, then continued on to the ophthalmologist's. My magnesium level is
again low, as is, now, my hemoglobin count (>red blood cells, oxygen etc.). What's with
the iron problem? The day after we arrived on Cape Cod, ie last Sunday, I noticed to my
consternation that I was spotting, not heavily but enough to send me to CVS for
absorbent pads (is this tmi? I've lost nearly all shame regarding my bodily functions...). I
was further concerned as I'm obviously post-menopausal, yet the blood had to be
coming from somewhere. I sent Dr. Patel's nurse a message via the Geisinger portal, to
which she responded with a phone call the next day. One or more of the tumors on my
'vaginal cuff' is likely bleeding, not uncommon with ovarian cancer.  It feels like awful
period cramps 24/7 (the irony is not lost on me as I had nearly all my 'hardware'
removed during debulking surgery). My pelvis aches. The bleeding also explains the low
hemoglobin count and the acute fatigue, shortness of breath etc. while we were on the
Cape. So now I'm to have three more iron infusions after today's; the good news is that I
seem to already feel perkier from this first dose! I'm grateful that Dr. Patel's office is
monitoring me closely.
Basically, the middle third of my body -- chest, abdomen and pelvis -- causes me much
discomfort, sometimes pain. Cancer in my pleura can make it hard to find a comfortable
sleeping position (though I've been sleeping well - lots of dreams). Oxycodone every six
                    
hours helps relieve pain and I nearly always have a heating pad near me to alleviate
back/pelvic discomfort. Long soaks in the jacuzzi at our hotel in Chatham also felt terrific.
I've been giving much thought to how to treat my body as compassionately as possible.
This afternoon I had an appointment with my ophthalmologist, Dr. Marcovitch. I'm
pleased to report that, following a month of horribly blurry vision, a trip to a specialist at
Hopkins, steroid drops, and much aggravation, my corneas have healed completely. I
marvel at my body's ability to heal certain deficiencies while under siege from cancer. I
also have to go pick stronger lenses that I ordered, which should help further correct my
near-sightedness. I may well need cataract surgery (requiring at least 5-6 office visits)
but we're leaving that discussion open, because....well, because.
I've had a mild headache or two recently, which of course makes me worry about my
brain.  While this organ has been 'cooperating' since my last go-around with radiation, in
the past new spots have emerged every few months or so. I'm waiting for Dr. Patel the
younger's office to call me (likely later this month) so we can schedule an MRI, once it's
been approved by Highmark. We'll then proceed from there.
I still haven't decided which of the three options Dr. Beavis presented to me I will go for:
clinical trial (a longshot, imo); oral chemo drug with 10-15% chance of effectiveness (ie
in terms of stabilizing or reducing cancer load); cessation of treatment. So for now I do
nothing. Is this a de facto choice? Quality of life needs to guide my decision. Initially I felt
that stopping treatment was the 'easiest' choice because it requires no evident agency
(e.g. taking a medication, travelling to a clinical trial site) but now I understand that it
may be the hardest option as it requires full acceptance of my situation.
I am still eager for visitors. Lying on my couch in my sunroom warmed by my heating
pad and blissed out on  pain meds, I'm ready to dive into conversation and quality time
w/friends and family. It takes my mind off cancer, that's for sure. My cherished friend
Helen and I had a wonderful visit on Sunday. We laughed uproariously reminiscing about
an improbable, slightly embarrassing situation we experienced together a few summers
ago; shed some tears; dished about work, family, life, travel and more. Thanks to my old
school pal Zia, I also met her friend and former NYTimes editor, Christopher Philipps, a
native New Yorker of E. European Jewish descent  like me, who was en route to spend
time in an Amish/Mennonite community in Ohio. How he met these folks is only one of
the stories we spun during a delightful. *And* as I've been blogging this evening I've also
been texting with my grad school bffs Vinni and Isabelle, who plan to visit me in early
August. I can't wait!
Michael kindly brought me some of Sue's borscht earlier. I'm sure it's delicious and look
forward to sampling it for dinner along with Peruvian chicken delivered by my friend John
Ochoa, a fabulous cook. On that note, I'm also exploring the possibility of having a local
chef/caterer with an excellent reputation  make some of my meals going forward. Meal
                    
prep can tire me, even though I love  to cook.

370,"I had intended to report on our recent trip to the Cape. which I hope to do still, but write
with a cancer update instead. 
I'm about 99% decided on stopping treatment. Option 1 presented by Dr. Beavis, joining
a clinical trial, would involve travel that would undoubtedly sap whatever paltry energy
reserves I could tap into at this point and would mean time away from friends, my cozy
home etc. Whether I'd even be admitted to a trial having had brain and liver mets is
unlikely, but theoretically possible. I will share with Dr. Cohen at MSK the report on my
next brain scan, upcoming in early August, and he and Dr. Beavis will let me know what
might be available to me in term of trials at Hopkins and at MSK. Option 2, taking an oral
chemo med daily with a 10-15% effectiveness rate, means putting more poison into my
body, returning to weekly blood work to ensure no drops in red and white blood cell
counts that could lead to infection, and other side effects etc. Of course, that 10-15% is
presumably made up of *real people,* so why not me? But didn't Einstein define insanity
as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results? This would be my
*seventh* line of chemo. By now, those cancer cells have made themselves nice and
comfy inside my body, have generated their own blood supplies and created a perfect
environment in which to thrive. I think I'm done.
I had to get past the feeling that Option 3 was somehow a cop-out because it involves no
*action* on my part -- e.g. taking a pill, sending off reams of documents to hospitals
sponsoring clinical trials, travel. Shortly I began to understand that rather than a passive,
default choice, Option 3 is in fact the most difficult choice as it implies acceptance of my
situation. Yes, it is the antithesis of the 'leave no stone unturned' approach. Its goal is
ensuring quality of (remaining) life as opposed to (potential) quantity.
Three of my doctors -- Patel, Perez (oncology therapist) and Vithalani (palliative care) --
have also promoted discontinuing treatment. While I listened closely to them, their
influence was not decisive. Dr. Patel said he would support me if I wanted to try
treatment with an oral chemo. Dr. Beavis has left the decision to me. Everyone seems to
think, though, that all three options will have the final end result.
*****************************
Update within an update: So I just returned from the radiation oncologist's to discuss the
bleeding that started on the Cape and the possibility of using radiation to stop it. I had
been previously told merely that ""Dr. Patel (junior) wanted to talk this over with you"" so
imagine my surprise when I was told to undress for a pelvic exam that Dr. Patel would
perform. Since he's actually a very sweet, puppy-faced guy (really quite cute, but too
young for me...), he quickly reassured me that he performs these all the time, that we
could stop if I were in pain etc. I didn't fully understand the need for the exam as I was to
have a CT scan of my pelvis right afterwards (also news to me when I showed up for my
appointment) but I think the exam had to do with visualizing and feeling the source of
                    
the bleeding. In any event, the exam was shorter and less invasive than one an ob-gyn
would perform. Dr. Patel's PA, Angie, an annoyingly cheerful central PA type who
responds to any question requiring an affirmative with a disconcertingly enthusiastic
""YEPPERS!,"" was also in the room. Dr. Patel could clearly feel a tumor that was the likely
culprit. I then went next door in his office to have a CT-scan. Due to the pelvic exam, I
started bleeding more heavily than before; lying on the hard surface for the CT-scan, my
back was hurting a lot as the technician drew spots and crosses on my hips and pelvis
with a Sharpie. I was in tears from the pain, quite frankly. The upshot is, though, that Dr.
Patel would like to treat my bleeding tumor with radiation. This will likely stop the
bleeding and may shrink the tumor too. Left untreated, I will continue to bleed, risking a
drop in hemoglobin and anemia. My bladder may also become irritated or compressed.
This bleeding is not inconsequential.  Onward then to *fifteen* more rounds of radiation,
supplemented by iron infusions for two more weeks (had one this morning).
This means I must again reach out for help with rides. Dr. Patel wants me to take a
painkiller before each round (I am now armed with morphine...) so I won't be so darned
uncomfortable while it's happening. And I can't drive myself to radiation if I'm taking this
type of painkiller, as I'll be too woozy. Sooo..... I need fifteen rides divided among any
number of people. Total time involved: 1-1 /2 hours max? This will involve picking me up
at my place, driving me to the hospital, waiting while I undergo radiation (20 mn.), then
driving me home. . Most appointments are at 1:30 (with a few exceptions) over the next
three weeks (beginning this Thursday, actually). Thanks in advance for letting me know if
you might help me out with this. Uber can always be a default but frankly it's neither the
most convenient nor desirable option.
***************************
Sunday I was visited by a case manager for UPMC hospice services, for which I'll be
eligible anytime after officially stopping treatment. Hospice is a form of care focused on
preserving and extending quality of life for terminally ill patients. It's no longer our
'grandparents' hospice,' an 'antechamber of death' where patients lived their final days
in a morphine haze. The local team consists of a nurse (who would come to my house at
least once every two weeks), nurse's aide, volunteer(s), social worker and 'spiritual
advisor.' These folks could come over on an 'as needed and desired' basis for as long or
short a period as I'd like. Frankly, I could use all the help I can get, am eager to get relief
from stronger pain meds as I'm often in much discomfort, and need to get my hands on
some medical devices such as a Life Alert; the hospice team can attend to all these
needs. Rabbi Ostrich happened to call me yesterday and we'll get together next week. I
would more likely lean on him more than on 'spiritual advisors' provided by UPMC
hospice, none of whom are Jewish, although their training for this part of their job is non-
denominational (again, we're in rural central PA here, sigh...).  I would have loved to
have been visited by the wonderful Hopkins chaplain, Rhonda, a progressive Methodist
minister, but she's obviously too far away.
I'm thinking comfy, cozy, hygge, sunroom, visitors, peacefulness, iced tea... I feel like I
                    
should be delving into profound works of literature (I did crack open Viktor Frankl's
_Man's Search for Meaning_ the other day), but mainly I feel like relaxing on the sofa in
my sunroom and watching cooking shows! Speaking of which, Rebecca, a local private
chef with an excellent reputation, will likely soon begin cooking for me two or three times
a week. I love to cook as always, but it can tire me out (at least now due to my blood
loss/low hemoglobin/anemia issues).
My friends have been magnificent all along. Saturday night two of them hosted a potluck
that was sort of my idea at the outset but somehow morphed into being ""Willa's party!""
Everything about the evening was perfect: gorgeous summer night (not too hot, no
humidity), crescent moon, delicious food and drink, live music, a magical outdoor
setting, great company. I'm a lucky girl. My friends Maria, Jackie, and Kathryn have
visited, ditto yesterday my friend Esther, bearing the red lentil soup and blintzes (!) I
asked if she would make for me. Dinner tonight at the Ale House with friends Cheryl,
Sandy, and Kathryn. At this point I can handle outings in moderation; I tend to get tired
and uncomfortable after a while, although I rallied for four hours Saturday night's party.
I've always loved a good party.

371,"I wanted to make sure to leave some written and visual traces of our trip to Chatham,
where Ben and I vacationed three summers ago. This may be a bit of a 'telegraphic'
report, though, and punctuation is assuredly 'anarchic!'
Drive with Ben with overnight stop in Fishkill, NY (Hudson Valley) w/take-out dinner from
the dazzling Red Line Diner (gleaming chrome - huge menu - bustling - display case
boasting every type of pie imaginable) - Ben and I have some of our best talks on long
car trips - pick up Sammi the next day from the train station in Brewster, NY (had déjà
vus of all my comings and goings along that train line when I was in high school and
college: to New Canaan to visit Julie, to Irvington to visit a friend, Gay,  whom I had met
on my France trip when I was sixteen; to Michael's parents' home in Hartsdale - same
Tudor-style architecture in the shops surrounding the station - same Westchester-ish
vibe) - Sammi drives us to Chatham, on the 'elbow' of the Cape, listening to podcasts
(David Chang; interview with Jake Tapper); thick haze that doesn't leave for two days -
can't see the ocean! Cooler temps and mist, not unpleasant; Chatham Bars Inn perfect in
every way (those lush sheets! those salt caramels and aged cheddar cheese and
crackers awaiting us! those thick, fluffy towels! that ultra-professional service poolside
and everywhere else on the property! those hydrangeas and that gorgeous
landscaping!); first night dinner at The Impudent Oyster in town (cold, briny Wellfleet
oysters - I can never get enough of that unique taste sensation, but which goes better
with them, mignonette or tartar sauce or 'au naturel?' -- chilled rosé -- Caesar salad
w/jumbo shrimp) -- Sammi and Ben take a stroll in town (and bring me fudge!) while I
                    
return to my bed to rest. Next day, bleeding starts, which freaks me out not a little. Call
Kayla at Dr. Patel's and she advises monitoring symptoms until my return - bleeding
likely caused by a tumor. Feeling under the weather the whole time but manage to
compartmentalize and enjoy the time away - Ben comes to my room to wish my
goodnight each night - very calming. Next day relaxing at the pool - whirlpool feels
terrific on my back -- love the poolside service (lemonade, iced tea, guac, but Ben and
Sammi also bring us lunch from a cute sandwich shop in town - tuna salad, Thai noodle
salad etc.). Ocean still not visible! Dinner at Mac's, casual place we had discovered three
years ago. Succulent fried clam bellies, a squirt of lemon, and tartar sauce. Is there
anything better? Hamachi crudo. A fish curry for Ben and Sammi. Following day weather
is poor (drizzle): Ben and Sammi hit the golf course, I get comfy on my bed w/my heating
pad. Given the weather, we opt for a nice lunch at the Sesuit Harbor Cafe in Dennis,
revisiting a place we had liked three years ago. Fabulous lobster roll! So fresh, just the
right amount of mayo, a squirt of lemon, have it with coleslaw to add some crunch. I
have dreamt about this encounter with the perfect lobster roll for three years! I forget
what we did for dinner that night; I think we brought food in from somewhere, perhaps a
seafood shack near the hotel. Ben drives me to see nearby lighthouse at some point. We
also take a little drive one day -- love the Cape architecture, the shingle-covered houses,
the marinas, the summer hydrangeas. Shopping at Chatham Candy Manor; picked out
chocolates and other goodies as gifts. Town  crowded with tourists. Ben and Sammi get
ice cream cones one night. Last day: lovely weather (yay). Another pool day for me. Long
chat with an art director from Massapequa (home of the alleged Gilgo Beach murderer...
I'm following avidly...). Many hotel guests from NY and Boston areas (do I dare wear my
NY Yankees cap?). I never made it into the ocean, although I had intended to. Ben and
Sammi take a boat to explore a nearby beach. Frequent soaks in the whirlpool. Later that
day, manager's reception. I'm too tired to stand and make chit-chat so I relax on one of
many comfy sofas in the lobby. Ben and Sammi check out the reception and meet a few
of the chefs. Many young foreigners as servers and other staff; a lovely young man from
Croatia serves us drinks. Lounge outside in Adirondack chairs as we take pictures of one
another. Dinner: return to Mac's: more clam bellies, oysters. Nightcap at the hotel: I
indulge in a Dark and Stormy; it matches the weather outside. Ben and Sammi are
wonderful travel companions: upbeat, solicitous, very helpful, relaxed, fun. It is always a
pleasure to spend time with them.
Leave early for drive to NY (5 hours or so? more?). Spend evening at my mother's.
Relaxing, comfortable, good chat. My mother always intuits what I'd like for dinner and
so we both enjoyed delicious cold borscht from Zabar's and some mini-quiches from
Breads Bakery (plus a babka to take home). Slept well, got up early as Sammi picked me
up around 7:30 to drive me back to State College (so kind of her; we gabbed a bit in the
car). She stayed over and headed back to the city the next morning.

373,"...the heavy cavalry, the big guns, the Conestoga wagons circling me, keeping me
comfortable, warm, safe, care-free, nutrified with healthful food and nourishing
conversation.
The friends are here! The ones I've known for 40-60 years and who are like family. What
a treat.
Hard to recount everything we 'did' or will do because it is mainly about 'le feeling.' I've
always liked this quote attributed to George Eliot: “Friendship is the inexpressible comfort of
feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words.""
Let me insert a health update here, before returning to the cavalcade of pals: more or less status quo.
Lacking energy big time (even writing these posts seems a challenge at times, but I persist). Fatigue
after minimal exertion. Painkillers (Oxycodone and Morphine) help a bit. Discomfort/pain (chronic) in
middle third of body, esp. pelvis, sides/back (pleura). Heating pad a necessity. Pain is not fun. Seven
                    
sessions of radiation down out of fifteen. Still bleeding. Hope it will stop by mid-next week, as Dr.
Patel suggests. The thought that this course of radiation might not be successful had not even
occurred to me until recently. Brain MRI upcoming this week, ditto for magnesium and iron infusions
and five rounds of radiation. My spirit is willing but my body falters. It seems that I may not be able to
start hospice until all the radiation is done; hospice does not appear to cover the cost, or all of it. So
I'll wait another ten days, or longer if I need more radiation on my brain. No suspicious headaches to
speak of in the past three months, thankfully, but I'll wait to learn about the scan results. Even minor
activity is tiring: a profusion of ants in my kitchen and sunroom last night taxed me. I did what I could
w/Raid (bending down to spray the sideboards was most uncomfortable), then my friend Greg (my
friend Helen's husband) came over today to spray with a stronger product. The ants, which likely got
in the house after work on my gutters last week, appear to be gone, but I find it increasingly hard to
deal with even minor stress such as this. Rebecca, the personal chef, will offer a 'trial run' this week
(chicken coconut curry soup, wild salmon cakes w/dill sauce, green salad), and then I'll likely have her
cook 2-3 meals per week for me. My house cleaner will also be here, plus the rest of my life-saving
'crew' (Kelsey, Liz, Abbye). Rabbi Ostrich will visit me on Thursday; I have a number of items on my
agenda to discuss with him.
Shanny drove out here from Brooklyn this week, bearing nourishing butternut squash soup and a
gorgeous lavender orchid plant (received a magnificent bouquet of multicolored roses from my former
grad student and now close friend, Christi, this week; made my day. Love being surrounded by such
beauty. Christi's kindness and caring nature are scarcely paralleled). Shanny and I sat in my sunroom
and gabbed (about NYU friends, family, relationships, future plans, summer adventures, what
happens when we die and more, with affect ranging from light and humorous to heavy and thoughtful,
and everything in between). Thanks to her, I enjoyed an invigorating, relaxing foot massage and a
nice dinner, to which I contributed a very good ratatouille I had made from Melissa Clark's recipe (I
say it is an 'aspirational' ratatouille as none can match the slick and oily -- but not too -- herby,
intensely flavorful ratatouille with eggplant, zucchini, tomato, onion and garlic I once sampled at an
open-air market in Provence; that's the gold standard for me. Tonight, the rest of the NYU 'brigade'
begins to arrive. Vinni is flying in from Boston and will be joined by Isa and her husband Rob on
Monday (they'll return to their country house in Laporte, PA, Monday night). On the 18th, my darling
Mitchel, my best college friend whom I first met when I was the only first-year student in a course on
Proust and was befriended by Mitchel and a friend of his, arrives from Nice via New York, where he'll
be visiting friends and family. I miss him so much and greatly look forward to spending time with him.
Cousin Julie arrives from Florida in early September. Ben will most likely come up for Rosh Hashanah
(combined with a PSU football game!), and I may possibly get to see him this month too. While I was
tired after Shanny's visit (slept twelve hours!), I also felt as though I had received a big shot of love.
How wonderful to be able to be so authentic with these friends, and actually *deepen* these
friendships. There is a balm in GIlead!
Other visits from out of town friends might yet be scheduled. I'm so happy to spend time with these
pals before I may no longer be able to.
I've been able to visit with other friends on drives to/from the hospital for radiation: my wonderful
friends Cheryl and Nancy (intense convo about food: my ratatouille - again! - and the latest Ottolenghi
recipes N., a fantastic cook, has been trying), Michael (who was convinced that a guy sitting next to
me in the waiting room was a Q-Anon supporter b/c of the strange, nihilistic rhetoric he was spouting).
                    
Yesterday, my dear former colleague and friend Bénédicte, bearing arugula and tomatoes from her
garden, spent a few hours with me over cold drinks and nibbles; I got caught up on department news
and learned much more than I had ever known about B's family. And two days ago it was Ben's best
friend (since kindergarten?) Nikhil, who texted me to say he'd be in town to visit his parents and
asking to visit. Nikhil lives between Boston and New York; he and Ben are thick as thieves, which
makes me so happy as both are stellar guys, creating excellent opportunities for themselves
professionally and doing really well personally. When I think about the young men and women of this
generation that I'm privileged to know (including Ben's friend group, many of his cousins, several
former students), I truly think there is hope for a bright future. Nikhil, who works in the biotech field, is
cheerful, fun, smart, interesting, loyal, hard-working and polite (he insisted on washing his water glass
before leaving my house!). I really enjoyed speaking with him.",4,neutral,0.4959067,0.013121724,0.15189533,0.09370957,0.0972803,0.4959067,0.122385755,0.025700705
374,"Health update: I don't have enough fingers to stop up the holes in the dike where the
deluge threatens to come roaring through, causing irrevocable damage:
Eyes: The prescription given to me at Hopkins, which I just had filled here, was incorrect,
probably because I was still suffering some corneal damage when the ophthalmologist
examined me. So new lenses are being made, to arrive next week. In the meanwhile, I'm
(still) existing with very blurry vision, which makes me reticent to drive except for very
short distances. This problem will soon be taken care of, however. I just have to be
patient. And the whole episode (getting re-examined etc.) required 'bandwidth' I really
don't have much of currently.
                    
But that's the least of it.
Cancer throughout my body: As mentioned, middle 'third' of my body hurts. I'm no
longer able to sleep on my left side (which causes both dull and sharp pain under my
ribcage) and always have a heating pad near me. I'm taking morphine but at such a low
dose that I'm not sure how much it helps. It makes me tired but that's ok.
Pelvis: Today will have eleventh round of radiation out of fifteen. Lying still on a hard
table for fifteen-twenty mn. hurts me; I even vomited once afterward from the pain's
intensity. The technicians are very kind. What is most frustrating is that I'm not sure the
radiation is working. I am still bleeding, perhaps with a less heavy flow than before, but
I'm losing blood for sure. I just finished the final of four rounds of iron infusions; perhaps
Dr. Patel senior will prescribe additional rounds when I see him on Thursday. Will also
have a magnesium infusion this week. It hadn't even occurred to me that the radiation
might not stop the blood flow and shrink the 6 cm. tumor. I am really not sure what
happens next but I'll see Dr. Patel junior this afternoon.
Brain: results of last week's MRI are in: multiple lesions show increase in size consistent
with progressive metastatic disease. One lesion (or spot) is 3 cm. Can these be radiated
stereotactically, both because of their size and number (and placement)? Or is whole
brain radiation -- the line in the sand I said I wouldn't cross because of possible effects on
cognition -- necessary at this point? Any other alternatives? If I won't cross the line in the
sand and there are no other viable alternatives (gamma knife?), what happens then?
How slow or fast-growing are these spots/lesions? Memories of stifling headaches>time
for steroids (which inevitably cause me insomnia, while I've been sleeping quite well
recently)? ""Don't create worries,"" I am told, but frankly, this is hugely worrisome to me,
an awful thought to wake up to this morning (although, of course, not totally
unexpected). I'll know more this afternoon.
The radiation timetable is linked to hospice care. Hospice will cover five rounds of
radiation but no more (it's all about costs, insurance). So I'll need to see if/when I'll need
brain radiation, and how much, before I can get on hospice. Frankly, I'm eager for extra
help with pain management. On that note, I may also try medical marijuana for pain
relief. At least two people whose opinions I value have discussed it with me in ways that
make much sense.
Appetite: practically zilch. Honestly, I could bypass food entirely but know I have to eat
(drinking a Chobani peach yogurt beverage right now). The only tastes that appeal to me
are cold ones: a big glass of iced tea in the morning, Perrier, Carnation instant breakfast,
an occasional root bear float. And soup. And tastes of other things. But I can't always
keep the food down; vomiting and diarrhea sometimes follow *immediately* after I eat
something that disagrees with me. My stomach is ultra-sensitive and, as Dr. Patel
                    
mentioned. my cancer is likely affecting the appetite center in my brain. I scarcely
recognize the completely food-obsessed enthusiast I was in the person for whom the
mere sight of some foods makes her stomach turn. I still like to watch cooking shows and
to imagine a scaled-down version of my ultimate foodie tour, featuring little bites of my
faves: one piece of oily Szechuan eggplant in garlic sauce, half a profiterole, a tiny cup of
summer borscht from Veselka; a quarter of a Sabrett or Nathan's hot dog with spicy
mustard and sauerkraut.
Rebecca, whom I'm considering taking on as a private chef, cooked for me last week. Her
food is excellent: this first go around featured wild salmon cakes; chicken coconut soup
with shitake mushrooms, red bell peppers; a nice salad of corn, feta, cherry tomatoes
and lots of fresh herbs; yogurt dill sauce. The only issue is -- you guessed it -- I can only
eat a fraction of what she makes and I don't like to waste food. Right now we're talking
about how she might be able to adjust portion size, which dishes freeze well etc. It still
beats cooking, a great pleasure of mine that has become increasingly difficult for me
these days (I tire after standing too long).
Energy/fatigue: Again, I scarcely recognize my formerly energetic self in my fatigued.
dragged out current version. Blame the morphine? Blood loss? The physical energy my
body continues to direct towards fighting cancer? This past weekend I slept until nearly
noon, but then felt the need to lie down on my couch again right after breakfast (or
lunch, I guess). I am still intent on getting out of bed each morning, taking a shower and
getting dressed but often find it harder to do much else... Many friends have visited in
the afternoons; one offered to take me for a drive in the country (one of my favorite
activities!). This has been lovely.
Even updating my blog can be tiring. I want to continue to as long as I can both to keep
informed this wonderful online community of the past four+ years and to offer myself an
outlet in writing. But I might need to engage a 'guest columnist' or two here and/or I
might contemplate shorter, more frequent posts commensurate with my energy level.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I feel badly for not yet having responded to
some of the many wonderful (truly) emails, cards, texts etc. I've been sent. Please
understand my occasional radio silence in the context of what I've detailed above. I am
soooo appreciative of all your thoughtful gestures. I feel love for all of you. Please stick
with me! I do hope to respond, but might need to capitalize on  little energy boosts for
this to happen.
I had wanted to write, on a cheerier note, about my recent visitors, but now think I will
reserve that account for a separate post. Be well, everyone.",2,fear,0.7463307,0.022890884,0.012002796,0.7463307,0.0025321476,0.07228835,0.10925138,0.034703832
375,"A few more points of medical update before turning (in another post) to more uplifting
topics such as recent visits from a few angels:
*In what passes for 'good news' these days, today I will finish my fifteen rounds of
radiation to staunch bleeding from a tumor on my vaginal cuff. I hope the memory of
having to lie my cancer-ridden back on a rock-hard table and hold still for fifteen minutes
will soon recede; perhaps time will efface in ways that Morphine, Oxycodone, and Ativan
were unable to. I was unable to complete only one treatment (due to anxiety), while
another treatment -- but again only one -- ended with my vomiting copiously into a bag
the technicians provided. I guess that's not too bad a record. I hope they let me smash a
gong or something today to mark the occasion, or perhaps I'll just pilfer an extra Diet
Coke or two from the fridge in the waiting room. Best of all, in the end, I do think the
radiation succeeded in stopping the bleeding. Dr. Patel said this trend towards total 'shut
off' could continue for up to four weeks after radiation ends.
A big thank you to Susan and the other techs who were so kind to me and always
complimented my clothes (and eye shadow, when I wore it), even when I felt like a
wretch.
Another huge thank you and hurrah to everyone who shuttled me back and forth to/from
radiation, taking time out of your busy days, boosting my morale, making sure I go to my
appointments on time, providing sustenance in the form of spirited convo -- and/or soup
or lasagna! Thanks to my angels Jackie, Helen, Cheryl, Nancy, Michael, Sandy, Kathryn,
Mar, Maria and Natalie. Please let me know if I've omitted anyone - I hope not!
*MRI update: In response to the last MRI, which shows new lesions as well as recurrence
of certain prior mets, Dr. Patel junior is recommending waiting six weeks and then
rescanning, to see what if anything may have changed. He is averse to retreating
already treated areas such as my cerebellum, where there is now a 3 cm 'thing' (could
be cancer, could be necrosis). He'll send me to a neurosurgeon colleague of his in
Hershey if I want a consult, to explore surgical options. He thinks any symptoms I might
start to have will come on gradually; his office sent in a script for Dexameth. today in
case headaches return (memories of  the frightful, unbearable headaches that preceded
removal of my brain tumor by the superb Dr. Bettegowda at Hopkins, whom I plan to
consult to see if he concurs w/Dr. P's assessment of my situation). At first I thought that
Dr. P. was kicking the can, punting, 'giving up on me,' or what have you, but I now
believe he understands my preference at this point for not going hard against my
disease, opting instead for quality of life. So I'll likely go along with his recommendation,
relieved to have a break from radiation for  now. This in turn means that I can get on
board the hospice train as early as Monday, when a nurse will visit me at home for
intake, more general discussion of hospice care etc. What hospice will and will not cover
                    
($-wise) is still a little murky to me: seems to depend both on $$ concerns (when does it
not??) and on the overarching 'quality of life over aggressive treatment' philosophy of
hospice. We'll see how this plays out.
I'm on my way to getting a medical marijuana card! As initially described to me, the
process for getting one seemed daunting but it really wasn't in the end. I filled out a form
online (PA Dept. of Health); spoke by phone for about fifteen minutes with a local doctor
(very nice, also confronting cancer now) who 'certified' me; and finally filled out another
PA Dept. of Health form. Total cost for processing plus phone visit with local doctor:
$250. Now I await my card, which I'm told should arrive within five to twenty-one days.
Then I'll shop at one of our four local dispensaries, where a pharmacist will help me with
what I need based on my profile. Dr. Ejianreh suggested tinctures or an edible called
'troches' (?). I'm not sure my lungs could handle smoking. Who knew I'd be back to weed
after decades? Hope it helps with the pain.
Final update: Radiation, done. I was 'privileged' to ring a bell when I exited the treatment
room, surrounded by the wonderful, compassionate team of technicians (one of them
recorded the moment, but I don't think CB lets me post it).
Writing quickly now and finishing up as I await my dear college friend Mitchel, fresh off
the Megabus from NY (and, prior to that, fresh off the plane from Nice!). I'm so looking

tutelar deity, magical helper and healer in the home.
If you want to know the recipe for helping me feel better physically these days (or any
day, really), arrange a visit for me with one of my oldest, dearest friends. Maybe it's the
cure for cancer, who knows? I've mulled over how to write this post, how to explain the
love I feel for my friends, but I'm not sure I can offer anything entirely cohesive. These
are the sound bites that come to me when I think about the recent visits from Shanny,
Vinni, Isabelle and her husband Rob (also my old friend) and Mitchel: Chosen family.
Wrapped in a cocoon of love. Soul connection. Vibing. Feeling radiant, perhaps even
'radiating,' 'levitating' with happiness. Immense comfort and sense of well-being. A large
piece of furniture with drawers - ""un gros meuble à tiroirs,"" in Baudelaire's imagining - 
overflowing with memories. A safe space to feel all the feels, share all the thoughts.
Friendships that mellow, deepen, complexify, improve with age (ok, yes, like the fine
wines that we've shared many of over the years). Adventures, joyous occasions and sad
ones, 'fous rires' (laughing fits), tears, hugs. Our commitment to one another.
Forty, forty-five years of continuous connection, continuous involvement in each other's
lives. Mitchel and I met in a seminar on Proust my freshman year at Harvard, taught by a
waiflike British woman, Camille Naish, always late for class. I was the only freshman in
                    
the class; Mitchel, a sophomore,  befriended me, we clicked instantly, the hit the ground
running. Shanny, Vinni, Isa (and Rob) and I all met in grad school at NYU, such formative
years. I've always felt that a crucial part of our bond was the one we shared as women
trying, over the decades, to succeed in both our professional and personal lives (and
maybe finally having figured it out). We've all been up in one another's business: Vinni
lived with Isa and Rob in NY (Shanny may have too, at another point); Vinni, Shanny and
I shared a swanky apartment in Paris for a year, while Vinni and I took another Paris
apartment for the two of us the following year. We've been roomies at countless
academic conferences. Our four quite different personalities have always meshed so
well. The two 'dumb blondes' and the two 'dumb brunettes.' Les filles.
""J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mille ans...."" (Baudelaire, again). Mitchel and I
sharing our first trip to Italy at twenty (he was twenty-one). Broke but wildly dazzled by
the art! the food! the beautiful people!, we romped through Italy from north to south,
armed with a backpack and Eurail pass. Mitchel and I around the corner neighbors in NY
when he attended the law school and we were at the Institute of French Studies.
""Tonton"" (uncle) Mitchel taking little Ben out for Chinese dinner in Paris so Michael and I
could enjoy a date. Big Ben and his French tontons Mitchel, Randy and Fabien brunching
at the bustling marché  d'Aligre on Christmas eve day. Mitchel becoming best friends
with my dear grad school friend Randy (who now lives in Paris); both of them blending
into my Institute friend group of V, S and I. Vinni and I getting lost one New Year's Eve in
a deserted area of Madrid dominated by a massive bull ring, in a desperate attempt to
find our friend Phillip's apartment (way  before cell phones), following a week of end of
year revelry. This now-legendary story is one we like to recount to our adult sons.
Shanny adding salt instead of sugar to the apple pie that we were to serve our French
guests at our 'real American' Thanksgiving dinner in Paris. Many dinners and parties at
Isa and Rob's apartment on E. 17th st. in NY. Our 'French parents,' Mathé and Robert
(Isa's parents) nicely inviting us to 'crash' with them whenever we arrived in Paris in the
very early morning hours; sweat-inducing attempts to cram my luggage into that tiny
Parisian elevator in their building in the 11e.  Isa and Rob's wedding in Camp Hill, PA;
Shanny's in Brooklyn; Vinni's wedding dinner at a wonderful Indian restaurant in the
Village (to which she invited my mother); mine in State College. ""Long ago, it must be, I
have a photograph.""
I could go on and on and on while being mindful not to let the past overwhelm the
present.
""These fragments I have shored against my ruins.""
So these visits -- consecutive except for Vinni's overlapping with Isa and Rob's for part of
a day -- could not *not* be wonderful. Shanny gave me a foot massage. Vinni and I
indulged in ice cream cones from Meyer Dairy and had some laughs over a Borat movie,
which we watched in our p.j.s. I was spoiled with divine-smelling gifts from Fresh (Vinni),
                    
Guerlain and Fragonard (Mitchel) -- I tell ya, these pals understand my olfactory
obsession! We ate - and ate - and drank - and cooked - and ate some more. Extended
cocktail hours (G&Ts, Negronis, summer rosés). Salmon expertly prepared by my fées du
logis. Homemade butternut squash soup thanks to Shanny. Mainly, we gabbed and
gabbed, about everything: our families, memories, mortality, our summer goings-on.
We'll never run out of things to talk about.
Tired yet still 'light' today. A visit in my sunroom from my dear friend Helen was the
perfect complement to the weekend.

377,"This week brought a bunch of medical appointments as my new home hospice paradigm
falls into place. This means some different personnel, meds, schedules. On Monday, a
nurse from the UPMC (University of Pittsburgh) hospice team, Mollie, came to visit, to get
intake and physically assess me. The UPMC team is in regular touch with my palliative
care doctor, Dr. Vithalani. I wasn't certain how this visit would be much different from
that of Amanda, an account executive (not a nurse) at UPMC home health, a few weeks
earlier. No matter. The bottom line is that our two-hour meeting was (imo) a stressful
                    
disaster. Mollie could not answer my questions about what specifically my Highmark
insurance through PSU would cover or not regarding home hospice (there seems to be
much gray area here....). She spent about an hour on the phone with her supervisor
figuring this out for me. For another twenty-thirty minutes of the two-hour visit, she read
to me the 'fine print' of their various hospice care policies, in a monotone voice that had
a soporific effect (""You are getting tired....very tired...""). That left just a bit of time for her
to take my vitals and ask me a few questions. I said I wouldn't sign an agreement until I
knew exactly what my out of pocket costs would be, and for which services. No wonder
managed care and insurance behemoths have such a bad rep in this country!
Shortly after Mollie left, supervisor Amanda called and asked me how the visit had gone.
I minced no words, and also asked to have a different head nurse assigned to my team
for the duration.
The next day, a different nurse, Laura, came to visit. I definitely clicked better with her
than with Mollie, even in terms of cultural background (I'll leave it at that for now, but
definitely a consideration in these parts). She looked quite young but said she had been
hospice nursing for about five years. Any questions she couldn't answer received
responses from another team member the next day. She was quite thorough and careful.
She helped me get organized in an important way, by bringing (at no cost to me) a new,
multiweek, pill organizer in which she portioned out my next week's worth or so of
medications (still some kinks to be worked out with this system but I'm sure I'll get
there). Finally, as she noticed I was sometimes short of breath, she arranged for a local
med equipment place to bring me (again, for free) a portable oxygen dispenser (but not
a tank) attached to a canula (I was given several extras of these as well). When she left, I
asked her, among other questions, whether she'd be 'my' head nurse going forward. She
said it wasn't certain, depending as it does on nurses' schedules, case loads, driving
distance etc. but she could put in a request. I felt a bit crestfallen at this news, as I want
to feel confident in my trust in the nurse caring for me through this emotion-laden life
experience. Good news the next day, though, when Laura returned for a second visit:
she has indeed signed on as my head nurse (in view of weekly visits, most likely). In
turn, I agreed to the UPMC terms and conditions  whose vague nature had complicated
our early communication. Signed, sealed, delivered!
I think I'm getting my pain under control with morphine and oxycodone. It does make me
kinda loopy and less mentally acute or agile then I usually am. I'm hoping these
capabilities return. I also seem to awake in the middle of the night with night sweats -
can't tell if this might be from the heat pad that keeps me comfy at night or something
else. And I have occasional, odd aural 'tics, sharp sounds (like those of clanging metal
pipes) that I hear when I'm in a sort of liminal state between sleep and awakeness.
Meanwhile, the cheffing/cleaning and straightening/errand running/clothes and
dishwashing/bed-making structure provided by Liz and Kelsey, Abbye, Pati and Rebecca
                    
works excellently right now. I can't thank these women enough for their care and
service.  
My very dear friends continue to provide me with  all kinds of sustenance, including
spiritual. This past week has brought or will bring visits from Helen, Jackie (bearer of a
Meyer root bear float), Maria and perhaps Lisa for a jaunt in the countryside tomorrow.  A
former student, Casey, came over for iced tea and sweets yesterday. I'm so glad she's
continuing to chase down wonderful opportunities for herself. This coming year she'll be
living in Hamburg and working at the site of the former Neuengamme  concentration
camp, creating digital content for the camp's website and participating in public
outreach (she'd like to work in a museum, eventually). Casey's visit made me remember
my excitement about working with undergraduates and helping them achieve their
goals.
Ben also arrives tomorrow for about five days. I can't wait to see him.
Gosh, I hope this post is coherent. I really doubt my cognitive functioning some days!

378,"This week brought more 'transitioning' into hospice care and from there to thinking and
talking about, and envisioning, the contours of end of life care. I'm feeling more or less
status quo, which means fatigued much of the time, seriously lacking appetite (to the
point where the sight or taste of most food actually revolts me -- who could ever have
imagined this??!), and short of breath. I've hit on the right cocktails for pain
management (Morphine + Oxycodone + [as needed] Ativan) and sleep (Morphine +
Trazadone + Tylenol p.m.). Both are well-controlled; sleep is sound and restful (in my
dreams last night I was looking for a group I could daven with...). And Ben has been here
all week, which of course is a natural mood lifter. He efficiently prepares our meals,
makes sure I'm comfortable, runs errands for me. And he's just so darn pleasant to be
around. We watched _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,_ which imo has not aged well as
a film. Tomorrow he's not working, so we'll be off for a jaunt in the country, specifically to
an apiary that my house cleaner recommended, on a road dotted with farm stands.
Tales of hospice, part II: On Monday, Kelly, the social worker attached to my hospice
team, came to visit. She impressed upon me the necessity of getting a plan in place for
my end of life care *asap* (because sometimes bodily  changes  can occur very rapidly,
she said; other of my nurses and doctors, conversely, have conveyed the opposite, that
things will devolve gradually). She laid out three avenues she thought I should/could
pursue to ensure my access to competent end of life caregiving: a)agencies supplying
round the clock assistance if needed. In the same breath, though, she shared her
                    
wariness of this option; in her opinion, local agencies, short-staffed since the onset of
Covid, are not always reliable -- and their staff is certainly underpaid. She sent me a list
of local agencies that I am supposed to contact myself -- no rest for the weary, I
suppose...b)caregivers identified via word of mouth, potentially a group comprised of
willing and able friends and family members. c)""placement."" The very word makes me
shudder. I will not pursue this option. It is not the death I desire. I want to be at home. If
Kelly had been a bit more empathic, I think I would have 'digested' all this information
more easily but her fairly cold affect only agitated me. :(
My meeting with Kelly left me feeling deflated and stressed (hey, isn't this the stage
when I'm supposed to be ""pursuing what brings me joy?""). I looked forward to hashing it
all out with Ashley, my oncology therapist, the next day.
My conversation with Ashley proved quite helpful. Together, we worked out what seems
a feasible Plan A and backup Plan B going forward, tailored to my wishes. I'll likely share
more about these plans going forward, but won't divulge more for now as I'm still
working out the details for myself and those involved. Ashley also floated the idea of
hiring a death doula who might act as another compassionate presence at the end stage,
but in a way different from that of the hospice team (death doulas do not necessarily
have medical training, for example). I am attracted to the types of services death doulas
can provide: creating a serene environment in my home, bedroom (in my mind's eye, I
see candles, flowers, an immaculately clean space, hear music and psalms being read;
inhale lovely scents; create any additional legacy projects that appeal to me. I consider
my Caring Bridge blog, close to 400 entries strong, the most significant legacy of this
last phase of my life, but I may wish to gather photos, write letters, communicate video
messages. We'll see if I have sufficient energy to produce the creative work I'm thinking
about. [I should mention that there appears to be a death doula in State College! Who
knew?! I will call her for a consultation.]
Today was busy. Nurse Laura, whom I've met twice now, arrived around noon. We talked
about how I was feeling and remedies for certain problems (she ordered a cane for me,
for example). We also talked a good deal about end of life care (hospice will probably
make a home visit once a day at this point but it's clear I'll need some supplemental
help). She then organized and refilled my pill box for the week. We're communicating
well and slowly learning more about each other's lives; she admired my framed family
photos and was astounded by how much I look like my grandmother, Bessie. I learned
that she has a two-year-old daughter and (somewhat randomly) that she had kept her
own last name when she married. My hunch is that she's pretty outdoorsy, off on
vacation tomorrow to Bryce Canyon National Park with her father. In any event, her laid-
back manner made me feel much more at ease about getting 'personnel' in place
immediately for the final stage (""it always works itself out,"" she reassured).
By this time, Rebecca, 'my' (!) personal chef, had arrived, leaving me two hours later
                    
with two large containers of tomato basil soup and a goat cheese and veggie frittata. 
A bit later that afternoon, my 'helper' Liz came by to tidy up, wash some dishes, make
my bed, water plants, cut up watermelon etc. We wound up conversing rather intensely
about the trauma she had experienced growing up as a member of a cult-like church; I
tried to be a good and helpful listener as I feel kindly towards this young woman (and
towards Kelsey, too). I am so grateful to be surrounded by this small army of smart,
efficient, interesting women. They definitely lift me up.
Ben and I rounded out the afternoon at a newish brewery in town (root beer for me, an
IPA for Ben), just chilling in lawn chairs in the mellow late-August sun. Ben returns to
Brooklyn on Saturday but will actually make another trip here -- this one for two weeks -
five days later! He's bringing a group of his friends to experience a PSU football game
and the raucous partying downtown that usually ensues. I'm looking forward to meeting
them, and to having Sammi here for a week, along with Ben of course.",0,anger,0.37867886,0.37867886,0.17225872,0.26418537,0.002985082,0.09621479,0.066576496,0.019100642
379,"In several recent comments on my latest posts, I've been lauded for my 'gracious
acceptance' of my current situation. While I'd never want to criticize anyone's personal,
subjective, and well-intentioned reaction to something I've written, I do want to clarify
unequivocally, at least for myself, what I consider an important point: I do not accept
how my cancer has uprooted every fiber of my life. In fact, I find my entire situation
totally unacceptable. It is obscene, hideous, sad beyond measure. I had contemplated
devoting an entire post to my regret over being unable to realize some of my most
deeply-cherished goals -- loving on my (future) grandchildren, writing another book or
more, reveling in a part-time life in Paris. It often makes me so sad to think about these
losses, though, that I *accept* in order to *survive.* And I do try to be happy and grateful
-- and doing so brings me much pleasure -- that I did have so many wonderful
experiences, that I *was* that girl, then woman, that accomplished so much, met so
many incredible people, had so many adventures, travelled, raised a useful human,
cultivated many durable friendships, produced award-winning scholarship, mentored
dozens of students -- and more. I also understand, and I suppose accept, that my
distressing situation is motivated; it's simply the result of having a monstrous, often
incurable (and in my case not genetically predetermined) disease, the result of a bunch
of cells going rogue. That is the reality of my situation; I'm unconvinced that any
attempts to fight against it will fix it, certainly not at this point. But if I change my
perception of it, the crisis I've confronted for the past four+ years indeed becomes easier
to 'accept,' a fairly simple-sounding yet meaningful lesson I gleaned from reading Viktor
Frankl's _Man's Search for Meaning._
I don't know if any of this makes sense. And I admit the possibility of my feelings
changing at any point in the future. To be honest, some of my equanimity and calm
affect do surprise even me at times. Perhaps, as palliative doctor B.J. Miller writes in his
TedX talk on ""What Really Happens at the End of Life,"" ""you can always find a shock
of beauty or meaning in what life you have left,"" I have found such 'shocks of
beauty' in the many random (and not so random) acts of pure love and
compassion and kindness and helpfulness that I've been privileged to be the
recipient of. ""If we love such moments ferociously,"" Miller advises, ""then
maybe we can learn to live well – not in spite of death, but because of it.” It's
all part of the 'cosmic crescendo' (Miller's term, I believe) that I hope will
whoosh me up until the end of my days.
'Shocks of beauty.' Yesterday was full of them. Ben had the day off, so we
agreed to take back roads in the next county over from ours to reach an
apiary my housecleaner had recommended. It was one of those perfect days
weather-wise, 'back to school' weather: mellow sunlight dappling the trees
                    
with patches of yellow and gold, warmth with little bursts of cooler breeze
rustling the leaves, corn stalks as 'high as an elephant's eye,' cows lounging
lazily in the fields, silos punctuating the large expanses of farmland. Stillness.
We stopped first at Tati's bakeshop in Pleasant Gap to pick up croissants for
the next day's breakfast (Tati is the superb baker who's created my last two
birthday cakes, the last one festooned with gold foiled ginkgo leaves). Then
we drove about 25 miles towards Lamar, where after several turns we arrived
at Plunkett Road (which I never would have found had Pati not tipped me off).
Across from what looked like an old (colonial?) cemetery, which I would have
wanted to explore had I had more stamina, a small open shack boasted an
array of honeys inside, alongside pamphlets with teachings from the Gospel of
John. I fretted about whether I could leave a check in the cash box as I had
forgotten my $ at home. Fortunately, a friendly-looking Mennonite woman who
owned the farm with her husband returned from grocery shopping in time to
tell us that we could certainly leave a check. Honey is essential for the 'sweet
new year' we wish each other at Rosh Hashanah (i.e. in mid-September), and I
love to shop for different types of honey before the holiday, both for cooking
(honey cake! tzimmes!) and coating with crisp, cold apple slices.
I offered Ben the choice for lunch of either the Hublersburg Inn, an old country
inn along a former post road surrounded by farmland or, closer to State
College, a casual new restaurant featuring Georgian specialties (i.e. from the
country of Georgia!). He/we opted for the latter. At Cafe Luna we ran into
Derek Polay, Tatiana the baker's husband and an excellent chef himself (they
occasionally host pop-up dinners showcasing Tati's Peruvian heritage). I am
grateful for any signs of an emergent, interesting State College food 'scene.' I
had a hot vegetarian borscht (absolutely delicious, the cure (?) for the
concerning loss of appetite that has plagued me recently), while Ben had
Pelmeni soup (featuring a special type of dumpling). We shared 'boureka
bites,' flaky pastry filled with a yummy spinach and cheese filling. I felt tired
after our active (for me) day, so I crashed when we returned. Lying peacefully
on the couch with late-afternoon light streaming into my sunroom felt both
immensely calming and reinvigorating. 
What else? Thursday. Laura (the nurse from UPMC hospice) spent an hour or
so here, refilling and organizing my pill box, ordering some equipment for me
(e.g. a three-pronged cane), talking about how I'm feeling (as mentioned, pain
seems to be under control right now; if I don't take the meds, though, the pain
                    
in my pleura can be unbearable). While Laura and I were talking in the
sunroom, Rebecca was in my kitchen whipping up a delicious tomato and basil
soup (hard to resist, which is really good news for me now) and a goat cheese
and veggie frittata. Then Liz came by to tidy up and help with other tasks
around the house. With these three capable young women around, I felt
particularly well-supported!
This morning I bought my first cannabis products! The pharmacist first took
about 45 minutes to provide an overview: a)benefits of CBD v THC (the two
products I bought contain a mixture), b) mode of administration (I bought a
tincture and some edible troches, kind of like a cough drop); c) organization of
PA Dept. of Health and cannabis distribution within it (it is all very well
regulated; I did understand by innuendo, though, that many people use the
products primarily recreationally rather than medically, even though one is
supposed to have a valid medical reason for receiving the medical marijuana
card - can't believe how naive I am sometimes!). I am going to wait until
someone can be with me while I ingest these products, rather than taking
them solo. I know they're strong and I told the pharmacist that I don't want to
be 'frothing at the mouth' due to the THC content - lol. My hope is that they
will help a lot with pain management, a boost for my appetite, controlling
inflammation  and more. We'll see.
I put Ben on the Megabus to NY at 12;30 and know that he's already home.
Meanwhile, I'm greatly looking forward to visits this week (I think) from Jill (my
grade school chum and last year's travel companion to Paris before Covid got
her...) and her husband Fred, followed by my dear cousin, Julie. Then Ben
returns here Friday for two weeks! He's bringing a crew of his Brooklyn friends
for the full PSU football weekend experience, which probably includes
tailgating before the game against Delaware. I look forward to meeting those
pals for Sunday brunch (just after my cousin Julie heads back to FL) and then
to hosting Ben and Sammi for one week and just Ben for the next. Michael and
Sue have kindly invited us for dinner the first night of Rosh Hashanah. We
wish them a speedy return to fullness of body and spirit as they've both been
battling....Covid!

after an active last couple of weeks.
Since Willa’s last post, I drove out to State College to spend some time together. Having
already been through the trenches together the past 4.5 years, we were able to have a
very pleasant and low key gathering. 
Subsequently, I brought Willa back to Manhattan with me, where she stayed for 5 days at
our mother’s apartment. 
A revolving door of close friends, family and NYC culinary treats were delivered to the
apartment, which was Willa’s ultimate goal of the trip.
                    
Since Willa’s return to SC this past Tuesday, she has experienced increased fatigue,
waning appetite, and litany of other cancer related symptoms.
Steps are being taken to increase the amount of full time care for her at home, during
this hospice phase.
Please understand that Willa is grateful for everyone’s concern, messages, gifts, visits,
etc, but it is challenging for her to respond currently.
As always - thank you for your endless love and support.

not yet in place.
 
To those in State College: I am writing to request your help in supporting Willa around
the house in the coming days (I will be with her starting a week from today). This may
include helping her prepare a meal, into or out of her bed, navigate the home, or, if
                    
possible, spending a night with her until we have a dedicated nurse.

Ben here again. I am back in State College, where I’ll spend the immediate future with my mom. Thank
you sincerely to everyone that offered and provided support this week to fill in the gaps while we work

pain in her mid-region, fatigue, limited appetite, challenges navigating the home. Due partially to a

We have also been working quite hard to establish some semblance of full time professional care. The
reality of evolving needs, a labor shortage, and non-abundant resources in State College have made
this quite difficult. Currently, Willa has a care aid 10 AM - 3 PM Monday through Friday. By the end of
the week, we hope to have the evening shift covered as well. A hospice nurse will come three times a
week to provide critical nursing care. We appreciate the many offers of help from friends to spend a
night. However, this week of substantial help from her friends further identified that at this point she
needs professional care. 
 
Many thanks as well to those that have reached out to my mom and me to schedule a visit during the
day. I know how much you would like to see her. I will work this week to respond and schedule some
time, but any socializing is quite taxing for her, so it needs to be spread out. Texts to her are likely to
be received but unlikely to be responded to at this time. Thanks for your understanding.
 
I will try to provide another update in the coming days. My contact is below.

hoped, and spent her final week in her beloved sun room, visited by friends and family. It
was a beautiful fall day at peak foliage, her favorite time of the year.
We will share more news tomorrow regarding the date and time of the funeral and shiva
minyan, when they are finalized. They will be held this week, in State College.
Thank you to all that have offered support over the past week, months, and years. May
her memory be a blessing.",5,sadness,0.9325871,0.0009648701,0.0017760338,0.0016926825,0.024255658,0.027892577,0.9325871,0.010831124
